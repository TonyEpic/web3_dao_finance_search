 abstract = {Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

 abstract = {Evidence is a tangible demonstrative artifact that proves a fact and shapes the investigation of various misconduct cases involving for instance corruption, misbehavior, or violation. It is imperative to maintain proper evidence management to guarantee the admissibility of an evidence in a court of law. Chain of custody forms the forensic link of evidence sequence of control, transfer, and analysis to preserve evidence's integrity and to prevent its contamination. Blockchain, a distributed tamper-resistant ledger can be leveraged to offer a decentralized secure digital evidence system. In this paper, we propose a secure chain of custody framework by utilizing the blockchain technology to store evidence metadata while the evidence is stored in a reliable storage medium. The framework is built on top of a private Ethereum blockchain to document every transmission from the moment the evidence is seized, thus ensuring that evidence can only be accessed or possessed by authorized parties. The framework is integrated with the digital evidence system where evidence is physically stored and locked using smart locks. To secure the sequence of evidence submission and retrieval, only an authorized party can possess the key to unlock the evidence. Our proposed framework offers a secure solution that maintains evidence integrity and admissibility among multiple stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies, lawyers, and forensic professionals. The research findings shed light on hidden opportunities for the efficient usage of blockchain in other realms beyond finance and cryptocurrencies.},

Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer.

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals’ quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner’s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.},

These settings cover almost all voting scenarios that occur in practice. A proof-of-concept implementation for decentralized voting over Ethereum’s blockchain is presented. This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

 abstract = {Blockchain is undoubtedly one of the most potentially attractive technologies for the organization of financial services. The significance of the Blockchain technology in a banking system can be determined by three main principles that is; Disintermediation, Transparency and Provenance. The DLT (distributed ledger technology) eliminates the need for trust enforcer in the banking management system. This is made possible by the tamper- proof data in the distributed data records and all the participants in the network have the same version of data record with them at all times and it is unalterable. Blockchain promotes a public database record of all the customer transactions and other data, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy system as the customers have a 24x7 real-time access to it. Blockchain keeps an immutable distributed data ledger of transactions and this result in maintaining a lifecycle of the assets and its ownership from its first transaction to the most recent one. It reduces the chances of occurrence of theft, insurance fraud and misselling of the high valued assets or intellectual properties. Blockchain can be implemented in the banking sector for various applications like maintenance of data confidentiality, cheque clearing system, real time money transfer system (digital currency), supply chain finance, insurance, trade finance, KYC (know your customer), cross-border payments/transactions system, monitoring of consortium accounts, auction system and digital asset management. Blockchain technology can hence enable a decentralized solution for the banking ecosystem. The proposed system enables one platform for both the lenders and the borrowers to initiate their money transaction for lending, borrowing and repayment of the loan money. The transactions made throughout, that is, from the start to the last repayment can be viewed easily on a blockchain network thus increasing the transparency and trust of the customers and it resolves any disputes that can arise in the loan system. Along with this, a KYC registry based on blockchain is also proposed which will help in maintaining the KYC details in one platform which can be accessed by various banks for identification and verification of the customer in an easy and faster manner. It will increase the customer satisfaction as there will be no need for the customer to perform a KYC check every time he/she creates a bank account in any bank as the bank can easily access their KYC details from this system.},

 abstract = {The blockchain-powered decentralized applications and systems have been widely deployed in recent years. The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4\% of wallets and 83.5\% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.},

This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps.

 abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

Effective IoT management requires a comprehensive approach to prioritize access security and data privacy protection. Digital twins create virtual representations of IoT resources. Blockchain adds decentralization, transparency, and reliability to IoT systems. This research integrates digital twins and blockchain to manage access to IoT data streaming. Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration. The research presented in this paper enables multitenant access and customization of data streaming views and abstracts the complexity of data access management.

 abstract = {Web services that use a blockchain and crypto-assets (Web3 services) improve user privacy by anonymous logins using wallet addresses. However, since many users list their account identities (IDs) on social networking service (SNS) profile pages and reuse their account IDs for self-branding and curation purposes, which increases the risk of de-anonymization on Web3 services by linking these accounts. If such high-risk SNS accounts hold large amounts of crypto-assets, they are subject to account hijacking and spoofing attacks for financial gain. In this study, we proposed a method to discover highly relevant SNS accounts from a seed account on Web2 and Web3 SNSs and estimate their account ownership. We applied our method to 480 seed accounts of 9 different SNSs and discovered 1,233 new accounts. We found that SNSs with multiple URL input forms on their profile setting pages linked more accounts and revealed that 207 out of 253 (81.8\%) users reused their IDs across different SNSs. We identified 26 accounts linked to personal and crypto-asset information that are at risk of de-anonymization. Our user study using crowdsourcing services showed that as many as 232 (40.8\%) out of 568 respondents do not understand the traceability of blockchain transaction histories. We examined the security and privacy risks caused by account listing and ID reuse, and made recommendations for service providers and users based on our findings.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are often governed by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which are implemented via governance protocols. Governance tokens are distributed to users of the platform, granting them voting rights in the platform's governance protocol.Many DeFi platforms have already been subject to attacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.  In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.  We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.},

 abstract = {Modern public and private infrastructure is increasingly large and complex regardless of the industry within which it is deployed - communications, power, transportation, manufacturing, finance, etc. Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADSs) analogous to living systems with autonomous and decentralized subsystems have been developed to support the requirements of modern infrastructure. Large-scale infrastructure is increasingly a significant source of data on both its own operations as well as the society dependent on it. Big data from infrastructure can thus supply a variety of artificial and augmented intelligence systems. Large complex infrastructures typically require large complex organizations to operate and maintain. Such organizations though are typically centralized and constrained by bureaucratic policies and procedures. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are emerging that may provide better transparency, autonomy and decentralization for the manner in which these large-scale infrastructures are operated. The paper contrasts DAOs and ADSs before identifying the requirements for DAO administration of an ADS.},

People can benefit from Web3, facilitated by the advances in distributed ledger technology, to read, write and own web content, services and applications more freely without revealing their real identities. Although the features and merits of Web3 have been widely discussed, the network architecture of Web3 and how to achieve complete decentralization considering law compliance in Web3 are still unclear. Here, we propose a perspective of Web3 architecture, deController, consisting of underlay and overlay network as Web3 infrastructures to underpin services and applications. The functions of underlay and overlay and their interactions are illustrated. Meanwhile, the security and privacy of Web3 are analyzed based on a novel design of three-tier identities cooperating with deController. Furthermore, the impacts of laws on privacy and cyber sovereignty to achieve Web3 are discussed.},

The development of blockchain technology has shifted from cryptocurrency to decentralized finance, benefiting millions of unbanked individuals, and serving as the foundation of Web3, which aims to provide the next generation of the internet with data ownership for users. The rise of NFTs has also helped artists and creative workers to protect their intellectual property and reap the benefits of their work. However, privacy risks associated with permissionless blockchains have become a major concern for individuals and institutions. The role of blockchain in the transition from Web2 to Web3 is crucial, as it is rapidly evolving. As more individuals, institutions, and organizations adopt this technology, it becomes increasingly important to closely monitor the new risks associated with permissionless blockchains and provide updated solutions to mitigate them. This paper endeavors to examine the privacy risks inherent in permissionless blockchains, including Remote Procedure Call (RPC) issues, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), miner extractable value (MEV) bots, on-chain data analysis, data breaches, transaction linking, transaction metadata, and others. The existing solutions to these privacy risks, such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, Hyperledger Fabric, and stealth addresses, shall be analyzed. Finally, suggestions for the future improvement of privacy solutions in the permissionless blockchain space shall be put forward.},

Blockchain technology integration has the potential to enhance healthcare data management. By incorporating blockchain, healthcare networks can establish trust and ensure data security and privacy. However, existing studies mainly focus on the relationship between patients and hospitals, neglecting the incorporation of insurance aspects such as indemnity and insurance reimbursement. This paper proposed to address this issue by proposing a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare system that encompasses the entire process, from patient registration to payment and insurance claiming procedures. The paper's focus on privacy rules, which enables the systematic management of hospital data in compliance with regulations including the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is a major strength. The legal framework has been carefully examined to facilitate the implementation of this project. The system implemented in this study utilizes Hyperledger Besu, a private blockchain platform. Given the sensitivity of healthcare data, a privacy group and permission settings are employed to prevent unauthorized access. The technical design of the healthcare network and an early-stage prototype are described in detail.},

The review is followed by pilot-testing the metaverse platforms intersecting with Web3 technologies in real-world, particularly on the use of buy-and-sell, trading and item ownership under decentralized finance and financial technology. Finally, the research assesses the resulting metaverse based on user reviews and experiences on the feasibility of Web3 metaverse. The intersection of Web3 and the metaverse is still an early adoption of IR4.0 emerging technologies, yet the convergence of the metaverse, blockchain technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence is ultimately the precursor to the future Web4.},

The main objective of this system is to provide immediate access to patient health information while addressing concerns about privacy and security. It is developed on the Ethereum network using programming languages, tools, and technologies such as Ganache, Solidity, and web3.js. The system uses smart contracts to provide security and privacy, and transactions are verified and propagated to the entire decentralized network. The system includes a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) with a centralized privacy system that allows authorized parties to access and secure records quickly. The proposed system aims to achieve several objectives such as allowing users to receive the same data simultaneously, increasing efficiency, building trust, and reducing barriers. It secures data storage by restricting user access and enables the secure transfer of patient medical records. The solution allows for better transparency and ownership of sensitive data, which can be recorded and safeguarded via blockchain technology, therefore assisting the healthcare sector. This paper describes a medical record system and a new protocol that can be used quickly and safely, paving the way for more secure and efficient healthcare systems. Overall, the proposed system offers potential solutions to the challenges associated with traditional EHR systems and has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry.},

This publicly available dataset contains essential financial characteristics related to borrowing, including balance, loss given default, annual equivalent rate, and probability of default. Additionally, we develop a specialized mathematical model tailored specifically to this project. This model allows us to estimate the probability of default by considering the presence of crypto-collateral and utilizing Brownian motion passage levels.

It was one of the most widely-known blockchain applications in 2016, not only because of the most amount of crowdfunded money (i.e., ETH tokens) so far, in a very short period, but also due to the attack event. In this paper, a brief introduction of The DAO attack event is presented. We also present an acute analysis of the result that “the hacker stole large quantity of money from The DAO”, as well as the analysis of the suggested solution that “the wallet address of the hacker should be frozen” to the event given by The DAO community. Accordingly, two logical paradoxes are formulated on the event results and the proposed solution. Finally, The DAO paradoxes are formally described, analyzed, and proved in propositional logic.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo’s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be “The DAO Attack” in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary’s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

To generate a distributed ledger a blockchain (data structure) is utilized. Basically, a blockchain is a collection of (a page of a ledger or record book) i.e. blocks in a sequential fashion. A record book holds all dealings, timestamps, the hash value of the preceding block, record book compensation, record book number, and others. Each single record book holds a hash value of the preceding record book or block, therefore making a series of record books accompanying one another. In this research work, while discovering these DApps, we will discover them at a stage that is sufficient to comprehend in what way they work and manage various concerns. In this research work, we will deliberate and recognize Blockchain arrangement, how Ethereum works, writing smart contracts, the introduction of web3.js, and wallet services. Finally, we put forward promising clarifications in detail for improving the safety of the distributed ledger for industrialized applications},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

Addressing these critical shortcomings, this paper introduces a blockchain-based industrial data trading system that not only ensures secure and transparent data trading but also offers advantages over conventional systems. Unlike traditional marketplaces, our proposed system emphasizes trustworthiness by mitigating third-party risks, enhancing data integrity through decentralized storage, and employing graph technology for efficient blockchain querying. Further, with integrated access control, our system elevates security standards. Preliminary evaluations reveal the system’s potential to offer a more secure, transparent, auditable, and trustworthy data trading environment, distinctly outpacing the capabilities of current marketplaces.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.},

This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services and products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing personal data may result in the extraction of sensitive information, which, in turn, may lead to jeopardizing the users’ privacy. To mitigate this significant risk, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union elaborated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation forces Service Providers to obtain Data Subjects’ explicit consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. Nevertheless, the GDPR’s legislative text does not define how Service Providers must transparently demonstrate that they already have these consents. Moreover, most individuals do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither does this regulation provide them with efficient methods to be aware of what third parties are doing with such data. In order to address this situation, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. The new solution provides public access to immutable evidences that reflect the reached agreements between Data Subjects and Service Providers. In this way, Service Providers can effectively demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are able to control and manage their personal data according to their legitimate rights. We have implemented the new system, and we have performed a detailed study which includes: GDPR-compliance, provided functionality, security and privacy issues, and the cost in terms of gas and US dollars of the different operations to be run on the blockchain.},

 abstract = {Abstract:
Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.},

Blockchain has received considerable attention recently, due to its promises of verifiable, permanent, and decentralized data handling. In 2017–2020, blockchain (and associated technologies such as smart contracts) has progressed beyond cryptocurrencies, and has been hailed as a disruptive technology for a score of industries. This study adds to the growing body of research on blockchain adoption and blockchain-driven innovation in various fields, including transport, finance, and education. However, the impact of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) on the management of science has not been systematically studied so far. This paper aims to fill the gap by studying the experience of adoption of blockchain-based solutions in academia in 2017–2020. The research is based upon a critical review of projects, relevant literature, and qualitative research: interviews (N = 24) and focus groups (N = 4) with startup founders, scholars, university executives, librarians, and IT experts from the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), Russia, and Belarus. Key challenges and barriers to blockchain adoption in academia are delineated: usability and security issues, legal concerns, conflict of values, and a critique of political dimensions of blockchain governance.},

 abstract = {This paper evaluates blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy. Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.},

@article{KUBILAY2019333,
 abstract = {In conventional PKI, CAs are assumed to be fully trusted. However, in practice, CAs’ absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates’ validation, storage, and entire revocation process is conducted in CertLedger as well as Trusted CA certificate management. During a TLS connection, TLS clients get an efficient proof of existence of the certificate directly from its domain owners. Hence, privacy is now perfectly preserved by eliminating the traceability issue via OCSP servers. It also provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the security and performance of CertLedger and provide a comparison with the previous proposals. Finally, we implement its protoype on Ethereum to demonstrate experimental results. The results show that the performance of the TLS handshake and certificate validation through CertLedger is significantly improved compared to the current TLS protocol.},

Nonetheless, due to its decentralized architecture, fault tolerance and cryptographic security benefits such as pseudonymous identities, data integrity and authentication, researchers and security analysts around the world are focusing on the blockchain to resolve security and privacy issues of IoT. However, presently, not much work has been done to assess blockchain's viability for IoT and the associated challenges. Hence, to arrive at intelligible conclusions, this paper carries out a systematic study of the peculiarities of the IoT environment including its security and performance requirements and progression in blockchain technologies. We have identified the gaps by mapping the security and performance benefits inferred by the blockchain technologies and some of the blockchain-based IoT applications against the IoT requirements. We also discovered some practical issues involved in the integration of IoT devices with the blockchain. In the end, we propose a way forward to resolve some of the significant challenges to the blockchain's adoption in IoT.},

 abstract = {Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm which expands cloud-based computing services near the network edge. With this new computing paradigm, new challenges arise in terms of security and privacy. These concerns are due to the distributed ownership of Fog devices. Because of the large scale distributed nature of devices at the Fog layer, secure authentication for communication among these devices is a major challenge. The traditional authentication methods (password-based, certificate-based and biometric-based) are not directly applicable due to the unique architecture and characteristics of the Fog. Moreover, the traditional authentication methods consume significantly more computation power and incur high latency, and this does not meet the key requirements of the Fog. To fill this gap, this article proposes a secure decentralised location-based device to device (D2D) authentication model in which Fog devices can mutually authenticate each other at the Fog layer by using Blockchain. We considered an Ethereum Blockchain platform for the Fog device registration, authentication, attestation and data storage. We presented the overall system architecture, various participants and their transactions and message interaction between the participants. We validated the proposed model by comparing it with the existing method; results showed that the proposed authentication mechanism was efficient and secure. From the performance evaluation, it was found that the proposed method is computationally efficient and secure in a highly distributed Fog network.},

 abstract = {Protecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.},

However, these methods often involve transaction fees, potential delays, and security concerns. These methods lack transparency and traceability features, making tracking, authenticating, and verifying payments and their associated records difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based online payment system that leverages blockchain technology (BT) features and security to revolutionize financial expenses in the education sector. We also present wallet generation, fee tokenization and NFT generation processes. These processes utilize Ethereum and an interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store metadata information associated with fee payment details securely. We use Remix IDE, MetaMask wallet, and Sepolia test network to deploy and analyze the proposed system's results. We have also used the JMeter simulation toolkit to conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of throughput, latency, and response time. Our assessment identifies the increase in performance parameters with the number of users.

Therefore, this paper presents a decentralized stochastic optimization model of transactive energy management based on blockchain in the presence of CES. In this framework, the smart contract based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers technique is deployed on the Ganache and Ethereum blockchains, and the YALMIP toolbox along with CPLEX solver handle decentralized optimization in the MATLAB software. The numerical results demonstrate that not only the capacity of distributed generations is fully utilized, but also total costs of smart homes are reduced by more than 27%, and the total grid’s delivery power to smart homes is decreased by more than 24% compared to the inflexible scheduling.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications have gained a huge momentum and have spanned across all domains adding innovations to the prevailing solutions. The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46% uniqueness and 2.38% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.},

 abstract = {Societies at large still grapple to categorize digital space as a phenomenon. At the same time, scientists and developers are searching for innovative methods to better understand how the fundamental shifts caused by digital change will affect the future of humanity over the coming decades. Interdisciplinary governance research at the intersection of technological and environmental foresight is urgently needed to minimize the risks of technological change and explore how digitalization may support, hinder or re-shape sustainability transformations. In this article, we focus on the case of ‘blockchain’ or distributed-ledger technology (DLT) to investigate how recent digital technologies may support the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. Our investigation is centered on areas of public administration and governance which will most likely see an adoption of DLT over the next two decades, such as digital identity, social service provision, and innovative climate finance. To allow for a meaningful comparison of various use cases, we propose four guiding questions that can help researchers, decision-makers and practitioners to determine whether DLT might be an appropriate choice for the sustainability-related task at hand. Moreover, we illustrate how the initial design and subsequent implementation of DLTs may support more centralized or networked modes of governance.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition, the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food, medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification, and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability, and security. In addition, new challenges regarding security and privacy have emerged in the system as the ever-growing smart connected IoT devices generate a significant amount of heterogeneous data. Given these challenges, in this paper, we propose PPFchain, a new federated learning-enabled blockchain-based framework to ensure the security and privacy of sensor-IoT-based architectures using sampled ECS data. PPFchain has a lightweight, low-cost, high-performance architecture in the IoT-based blockchain network. In the architecture, we used the federated model and cryptographic primitives for user and data privacy in off-chain fog nodes considering performance. Moreover, we compared with traditional blockchain models using various performance metrics for system performance in a distributed architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract. In addition, the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced security.},

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has a great potential for improving efficiency, security and privacy of Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing systems. However, existing solutions relying on a centralized database are susceptible to traditional security problems such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and a single point of failure similar to traditional database systems. In addition, past solutions exposed users to privacy linking attacks and did not tackle performance and scalability challenges. In this paper, we propose a permissioned Blockchain based healthcare data sharing system that integrates Blockchain technology, decentralized file system and threshold signature to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed system is based on Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus algorithm and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). We implemented the proposed system on an enterprise Ethereum Blockchain known as Hyperledger Besu. We evaluated and compared the performance of the proposed system based on various performance metrics such as transaction latency, throughput and failure rate. Experiments were conducted on a variable network size and number of transactions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than existing Blockchain based systems. Moreover, the decentralized file system provides better security than existing traditional centralized database systems while providing the same level of performance.},

We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.},

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain.},

Our approach is informed by an analysis of the critical literature on ethical and design dilemmas concerning blockchain for social impact. The conceptual framework revolves around three principles (Internet of Values 2.0, disintermediation of services, and local adaptation), that are reflected in our technical choices. The approach makes blockchains accessible to local community members, leveraging some of their core affordances and advancing new interpretations with a focus on technical and economic accessibility.

 abstract = {Integrating blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT) for security is a new development in computational communication systems. While security threats are changing their strategies and constructing new threats on blockchain-based IoT systems. Also, in combining blockchain with IoT networks, malicious transactions and active attacks deliver more vulnerabilities, privacy issues, and security threats. The concept of blockchain-based IoT attacks is a hot topic in both IoT and blockchain disciplines. Network attacks are a type of security and privacy threat and cover the exact scope of threats related to the combination of IoT and blockchain. Even though blockchain has potential security benefits, new cyberattacks have emerged that make blockchain alone insufficient to deal with threats and attacks in IoT networks since vagueness and ambiguity issues are unavoidable in IoT data. The heterogeneous nature of IoT sources has made uncertainty a critical issue in IoT networks. Deep Learning (DL) models have difficulty dealing with uncertainty issues and cannot manage them efficiently as an essential tool in security techniques. Thus, we need better security, privacy, and practical approaches, such as efficient threat detection against network attacks in blockchain-based IoT environments. Also helpful to consider fuzzy logic to tackle deterministic issues when DL models face uncertainty. This paper designs and implements a secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework. This framework utilizes a novel fuzzy DL model, optimized adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based attack detection, fuzzy matching (FM), and fuzzy control system (FCS) for detection of network attacks. The proposed fuzzy DL applies the fuzzy Choquet integral to have a powerful nonlinear aggregation function in the detection. We use metaheuristic algorithms to optimize the attack detection error function in ANFIS. We also validate transactions via FM to tackle fraud detection and efficiency in the blockchain layer. This framework is the first secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework that identifies and detects security threats while considering uncertainty issues in IoT networks and having more flexibility in decision-making and accepting transactions in the blockchain layer. Evaluation results verify the efficiency of the blockchain layer in throughput and latency metrics and the intelligent fuzzy layer in performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score) in threat detection on both blockchain and IoT network sides. Additionally, FCS demonstrates that we obtain an effective system (stable model) for threat detection in blockchain-based IoT networks.},
