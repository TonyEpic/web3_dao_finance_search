 abstract = {The blockchain is the innovative technology in recent year. It brings a revolution to both industrial and academic area. In fact, it is a distributed storage system based on cryptography and consensus algorithms. Currently, many applications have been implemented in finance, agriculture, payment, and medicine area. We proposed a platform called High-value Commodities as a Service (HCS) to combine blockchain and high-value assets together. Traditionally, real estates, jewelry and artworks are main luxuries word-widely. We provide a sound and reliable environment for those investors to trade. Due to characteristics of the blockchain, users on our platform can track the source for each item. And all private data would be pushed on chains which can avoid some privacy-related problems.},

 abstract = {Upon its arrival, the Ethereum blockchain promised to introduce a new paradigm of Internet-based applications that would revolutionize multiple fields, from finance to IoT to the public sector. Until now, scientific efforts have been primarily focused on theoretical discussions about the implications of the technology and on technical proposals to improve and consolidate the underlying infrastructure, neglecting the experience of people using blockchain-based systems. However, for this technology to permeate the mainstream, blockchain technology should be easily accessible to the general public. This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps. Also, we saw how blockchain metaphors and transaction-mediated interactions challenge established mental models for modern applications, imposing heavy workloads on users. We conclude the paper by discussing design implications resulting from blockchain’s paradigm change.},

 abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

 abstract = {The advancements of the metaverse has validated a new world of possibilities with Web2 and Web3 technologies that are increasingly immersive, interconnected, spatial and decentralized. One of the key Web3 technologies that is intersecting with the metaverse is blockchain technology, that has now imbued metaverse worlds and platform as what are now identified as Layer-1 and Layer-2 metaverse, and in tandem the intersecting of decentralized Web3 technologies including but not limited to metaverse currencies and cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens and tokenization, marketplaces, digital wallets, and blockchain main and side-chain networks. In combination with interoperable and interconnected avatars, the metaverse is evolving beyond phygital experiences and asset architecting into financial experiences and asset trading. This research paper investigates the intersections between the metaverse and Web3 emerging technologies by firstly conducting a systematic literature review of the metaverse and its intersection with emerging technologies which currently has a dearth in academic and research literature despite the developments of the Web3 metaverse and its Layer-1 Layer-2 protocol. The review is followed by pilot-testing the metaverse platforms intersecting with Web3 technologies in real-world, particularly on the use of buy-and-sell, trading and item ownership under decentralized finance and financial technology. Finally, the research assesses the resulting metaverse based on user reviews and experiences on the feasibility of Web3 metaverse. The intersection of Web3 and the metaverse is still an early adoption of IR4.0 emerging technologies, yet the convergence of the metaverse, blockchain technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence is ultimately the precursor to the future Web4.},

 abstract = {Technology has advanced and with it, cybercrime has become a reality. The rise of Web3 technology aims to decentralize the internet and create a trustless network of smart contracts, leading to the limitation of conventional identification systems. Blockchain technology provides a solution to security concerns by instilling trust in end-users' minds. In this project, a blockchain-based identification system will be created using SoulBound Tokens. These NFT-like tokens cannot be transferred after minting, making them immutable and secure. Third parties can request users' credentials, which can be easily verified through the blockchain's transparent chain of custody. This approach creates a secure and reliable identification system that protects users' data and assets from malicious actors. This concept extends to finance, healthcare, and government services. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can create a more secure environment for individuals and institutions.},

 abstract = {With the continuous development of web technology, Web3.0 has attracted a considerable amount of attention due to its unique decentralized characteristics. The digital economy is an important driver of high-quality economic development and is currently in a rapid development stage. In the digital economy scenario, the centralized nature of the Internet and other characteristics usually bring about security issues such as infringement and privacy leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how to use Web3.0 technologies to solve the pain points encountered in the development of the digital economy by fully exploring the critical technologies of digital economy and Web3.0. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of Web3.0 that should be integrated with the digital economy to better find the entry point to solve the problems by examining the latest advances of Web3.0 in machine learning, finance, and data management. We hope this research will inspire those who are involved in both academia and industry, and finally help to build a favourable ecology for the digital economy.},

 abstract = {Abstract:
Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.},

 abstract = {This article introduces the next major generational evolution of the web: Web3. We review the fundamental evolution of the internet and the web over the past 3 decades, including a brief presentation of the publications in Business Horizons that are important in a discussion of the emergence of Web3. We then discuss what these recent developments mean to organizations, consumers, and the public. Though the degree to which Web3 will be widely adopted is uncertain, these technologies are already creating both exhilarating and terrifying implications for e-commerce, digital media, online social networking, online marketplaces, search engines, supply chain management, and finance, among others. We propose the consideration and management of technical, organizational, and regulatory interoperability for Web3 to deliver on its promises of value and that failure to consider these interoperability components may destroy economic value, consumer confidence, or social issues online. We also call on our fellow researchers to focus on these interoperability issues and how they might impact the positive and negative sides of Web3 technologies to help us understand and shape our Web3 future.},
