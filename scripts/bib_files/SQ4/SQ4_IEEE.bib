  abstract={Decentralized autonomy is a long-standing research topic in information sciences and social sciences. The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organizations(DAOs) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts is regarded as an effective tool to solve corporate governance problems. It can minimize the contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, and other issues in corporate governance. However, DAOs also face a variety of governance issues, such as internal governance issues and external governance issues caused by the technical attributes of blockchain and smart contracts. DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions. We consider that parallel governance represents the future trend of DAO research and practice. This paper is aimed at stimulating further effort and providing helpful guidance and reference for future research works.},

  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have become an indispensable part of digital infrastructure in recent years. The unique organizational characteristics and functional structure empower them to become an effective tool for solving corporate governance issues, including contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, etc. However, DAOs themselves also face a variety of governance issues. On one hand, as a new economic organization model, the existing corporate governance theories and methods are no longer fully applicable to DAOs. On the other hand, unpredictable logic vulnerabilities and code loopholes in the governance mechanism might cause devastating damage to DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the ACP method (i.e., artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution) is an elegant research paradigm and a practical approach tailored to solving these challenges. As such, we propose a novel parallel governance framework for DAOs based on the parallel intelligence theory and further discuss its technical methodology and implementation model. Furthermore, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO and conduct computational experiments to validate the effectiveness of its governance mechanism. The experimental results not only confirm the defects of the GnosisDAO governance mechanism but also illustrate parallel governance as a useful research direction to solve existing governance problems of DAOs.},

  volume={11},

  pages={2853-2862},
  abstract={The governance technology of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provides an effective solution for solving existing organizational management issues. Governance mechanisms of DAOs are usually encoded in smart contracts in the form of rule sets and executed automatically. However, the mechanism’s logical flaws and code errors expose DAOs to unpredictable risks. Complex adaptive dynamics computer-aided design (CadCAD) can test the effectiveness of the mechanisms through simulation. Nonetheless, as DAOs are typical complex systems with social and engineering complexity, managing, controlling, and supervising their operation through traditional methods are difficult. The parallel intelligence theory based on artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method provides an effective research framework and practical method for solving DAOs’ governance issues. Therefore, in this article, we propose a parallel mechanism verification method and execution system, namely, complex adaptive systems for computer-aided dynamic design (casCAD2) as an extension of cadCAD. Leveraging parallel intelligence and cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS), casCAD2 is capable of probing into the laws that govern system evolution within a simulated environment. It serves as a robust tool for verifying the efficacy of DAOs’ mechanisms and predicting their potential risks. We also build a parallel market-based anchoring mechanism (MAM) system to demonstrate how it can be used for DAOs’ mechanism verification. This study can provide a new research method and application system for DAOs’ effective governance.},

  volume={11},

  pages={1370-1380},
  abstract={The attention is a scarce resource in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), as their self-governance relies heavily on the attention-intensive decision-making process of “proposal and voting”. To prevent the negative effects of proposers' attention-capturing strategies that contribute to the “tragedy of the commons” and ensure an efficient distribution of attention among multiple proposals, it is necessary to establish a market-driven allocation scheme for DAOs' attention. First, the Harberger tax-based attention markets are designed to facilitate its allocation via continuous and automated trading, where the individualized Harberger tax rate (HTR) determined by the proposers' reputation is adopted. Then, the Stackelberg game model is formulated in these markets, casting attention to owners in the role of leaders and other competitive proposers as followers. Its equilibrium trading strategies are also discussed to unravel the intricate dynamics of attention pricing. Moreover, utilizing the single-round Stackelberg game as an illustrative example, the existence of Nash equilibrium trading strategies is demonstrated. Finally, the impact of individualized HTR on trading strategies is investigated, and results suggest that it has a negative correlation with leaders' self-accessed prices and ownership duration, but its effect on their revenues varies under different conditions. This study is expected to provide valuable insights into leveraging attention resources to improve DAOs' governance and decision-making process.},

  abstract={Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their promise of realizing the decentralized Web 3.0. However, most DAOs rely heavily on token-centric value systems as well as allocate decision-making authority and yield-sharing rights according to the held tokens, which often lead to monopolization of power and rights. To address this issue, this paper contributes to propose a truly democratic organization model, named True Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), that does not count upon tokens and is guided by principles of contribution-based and on-demand allocation. We first discuss the design of TAOs, including their infrastructures, power structures, and value systems, and then provide a technical roadmap for implementing TAOs in the DeSci context. This research can provide a valuable guidance for the construction and application of TAOs.},

  pages={76069-76082},
  abstract={Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.},

  abstract={In this paper, we analyze the current management status of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and propose a protocol for managing a DAO. For the management of this form of organization, decentralization and autonomy are particularly critical. This basic premise avoids the potential abuse of power by centralized authority because such a firm is governed by code. In centralized firms, company members have a stronger right to participate in decisions made by high-ranking administrators. Blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized form of indestructible data storage, has gained much attention in recent years. Smart contracts, executable code stored in a blockchain, are based on this concept. We propose an approach to building DAO using smart contracts based on blockchain technology, which provides the optimum conditions for the decentralization and autonomy of DAO. The results show that our proposal outperforms existing solutions in terms of team autonomy within the DAO, the ability of all company members to vote on proposals, and the members elected by the rest of the company for higher positions within the organization. The key benefit of our solution is the universal concept of DAO as a service for any firm with a team-based management approach. This platform may be used by many businesses and also provides extensive access rights control based on predefined rules.},

  abstract={Decentralized science (DeSci) is a hot topic emerging with the development of Web3 or Web3.0 and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and operations. DeSci fundamentally differs from the centralized science (CeSci) and Open Science (OS) movement built in the centralized way with centralized protocols. It changes the basic structure and legacy norms of current scientific systems via reshaping the cooperation mode, value system, and incentive mechanism. As such, it can provide a viable path for solving bottleneck problems in the development of science, such as oligarchy, silos, and so on, and make science more fair, free, responsible, and sensitive. However, DeSci itself still faces many challenges, including scaling, balancing the quality of participants, system suboptimal loops, lack of accountability mechanism, and so on.

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Blockchain has facilitated the emergence of automation and decentralization concepts, leading to significant organizational and operational changes in businesses, e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In DAOs, management decisions are made collectively and automatically through smart contracts without a central authority, which results in increased cybersecurity requirements. While blockchain integration aims to eliminate single points of failure and enhance data integrity, DAOs remain susceptible to vulnerabilities in consensus mechanisms, key management, and software management, highlighting the need for intrusion detection. Collaborative intrusion detection has been identified as a potential solution to address emerging cyberattacks in a decentralized environment; however, it is not yet fully developed. This study proposes a federated adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (FANFIS) for collaborative intrusion detection in blockchain–Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. The FANFIS maintains a global intrusion detection model in a privacy-preserving manner over the network. Through computational experiments with datasets of KDDCUP99 and Bot-IoT, we found that using the FANFIS reduced the computational time for model training by an average of 49.42% while maintaining a high-performance level. The superior performance of the FANFIS, as demonstrated by its accuracy, precision, and F1-score, surpasses the conventional method involving data centralization, exhibiting mean percentage errors of 1.4092%, 2.6935%, and 1.3463%, respectively.},

  abstract={The advent of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous innovations in online governance, with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) emerging as a prominent development, often referred to as “digital jurisdictions.” Despite experiencing remarkable growth, currently boasting nearly 7M users and   ${\$}$  18 billion in assets, DAOs remain relatively underexplored in the existing literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

  abstract={With the development of intelligent transportation technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces challenges such as data silos, security and privacy concerns, data quality issues, and collaboration barriers. To address the various challenges, this paper proposes an innovative integration scheme called the IoV Data Management System (IDMS). This system is built upon blockchain and parallel intelligence technologies, aiming to solve the challenges presented in the IoV domain. The proposed system uses the decentralized, immutable and traceable characteristics of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanism and collaboration model of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), to build a secure and trusted data sharing platform to solve data problems in IoV. This research combines parallel intelligence, blockchain and DAO technologies to provide an innovative framework for IoV information management. The proposed framework enables parallel management of connected vehicle systems, thereby improving safety, reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, it would promote the development and application of vehicle networking technology, and provide more intelligent, convenient and safe services for people's travel experience. Finally, a parking data sharing case study validates the effectiveness of the designed system and demonstrates its potential to solve IoV data management challenges.},

Because of no infrastructure, there are many challenges to overcome, especially, in security part. So we introduced Authentication trends on PAC As the number of PDs (PAC Devices) continues to grow, the need to deal with security issues increases consistently.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.},

  abstract={We propose a set of novel radial basis functions with adaptive input and composite trend representation (AICTR) for portfolio selection (PS). Trend representation of asset price is one of the main information to be exploited in PS. However, most state-of-the-art trend representation-based systems exploit only one kind of trend information and lack effective mechanisms to construct a composite trend representation. The proposed system exploits a set of RBFs with multiple trend representations, which improves the effectiveness and robustness in price prediction. Moreover, the input of the RBFs automatically switches to the best trend representation according to the recent investing performance of different price predictions. We also propose a novel objective to combine these RBFs and select the portfolio. Extensive experiments on six benchmark data sets (including a new challenging data set that we propose) from different real-world stock markets indicate that the proposed RBFs effectively combine different trend representations and AICTR achieves state-of-the-art investing performance and risk control. Besides, AICTR withstands the reasonable transaction costs and runs fast; hence, it is applicable to real-world financial environments.},

  abstract={In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo’s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be “The DAO Attack” in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary’s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

  abstract={This paper presents Management-Oriented Operating Systems (M2OS) that leverages the power of parallel intelligence theory, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and foundation models to revolutionize the manner of management in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). The parallel architecture on M2OS is proposed, including the parallel interactive actual M2OS and artificial M2OS. Among them, the artificial M2OSs provide digital infrastructures for organizations to operate, collaborate, and make decisions in the virtual space, and conduct computational experiments to evaluate management decisions and predict future states of the actual M2OS. Through parallel execution and closed-loop feedback between the artificial and actual M2OSs, the management and control, experimentation and evaluation, as well as learning and training of the actual M2OS can be realized. Moreover, the functional layers of M2OS, including the infrastructure layer, data layer, scenario layer, modeling layer, decision layer, and application layer, are discussed. These layers work together to support the intelligent, autonomous, collaborative, and adaptive nature of the M2OS, and facilitate data-driven decision-making, optimize business operations, and empower managers with real-time actionable insights. The proposed M2OS paradigm has great potential to transform the management paradigm and opens up new possibilities for intelligent and collaborative decision-making.},

  abstract={The open Source Software (OSS) became the backbone of the most heavily used technologies, including operating systems, cloud computing, AI, Blockchain, Bigdata Systems, IoT, and many more. Although the OSS individual contributors are the primary power for developing the OSS projects, they do not contribute to the OSS project's decisionmaking as much as their contributions in the OSS Projects development. This paper proposes a framework to democratize the OSS Project's decision-making using a blockchain-related technology called Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Using DAO, contributors get incentive tokens as a reward in return for contributions. The earned tokens can be used in the process of decision-making governance. This governance model tends to allow OSS individual contributors to have a public voice in the OSS project's development roadmap in particular, and the OSS decision making governance in general.},

  abstract={The development of smart cities has been a significant trend in recent years, aiming to improve the quality of life of citizens by leveraging technology and data. However, the current models of smart cities have limitations in terms of their centralized control and lack of citizen participation. City 5.0 proposes a new paradigm for smart cities that emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between humans and technology. This article presents the concept of Spatial Symbiotic Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a city to dynamically respond to the needs of its citizens and environment through the integration of data from various sources and the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and parallel systems. This letter also discusses the potential benefits and challenges of implementing City 5.0 and highlights some of the ongoing initiatives in this area.},

To address the gap, this work presents a primary investigation of DAOs (35+). We category, examine and evaluate existing DAOs regarding their operational features, (non-)functionalities and real-world performance. In addition, we provide a consolidated exploration of DAOs by conducting a literature review [1] and an empirical study on mainstream projects, particularly Snapshot [2].

Our paper implements and demonstrates a solution to this issue by introducing a quasi DAO (qDAO) that allows for centralized decision-making when necessary. By modifying smart contracts and introducing new rules, we strike a balance between decentralization and centralized management, offering potential opportunities for improved crisis management in DAOs. We present a demo of our qDAO implementation on the local Ethereum testnet, along with a web application for user input. Our approach expands the possibilities of DAO administrator control while maintaining the integrity and auditability of DAO operations.},

  abstract={In response to concerns over the centralization tendency in the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), TRUE autonomous organizations and operations (TAOs or TRUE DAOs) have been proposed recently. TAOs aim at spreading equitable value distribution and democratized decision-making, distinguishing them from their DAOs counterparts. This study focuses on the treasury within TAOs, which acts as a central fund pool and a crucial element in the decentralized economy (DeEco) system. First, against a backdrop of potential black swan events and other long-tail unforeseen challenges, a reference model for the intelligent treasury management of TAOs is proposed. Then, an evaluation system, namely VALID, is presented with metrics including verifiability, anti-volatility, legitimacy, inclusiveness, and decentralization. Furthermore, a novel parallel treasury management mechanism is proposed to demonstrate a virtual-real interactive closed-loop management and control paradigm of the treasury, thereby fostering the formulation and development of DeEco. This research provides a comprehensive perspective on intelligent treasury management of TAOs and their role in sustainable advancement of DeEco.},

  abstract={The aim of this study is to examine the efficiency of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) derived from differences in corporate governance structures and transaction costs compared to traditional organizations. Core assumptions on these differences from academic and grey literature are integrated into a model of the governance layers of the innovative socio-technical arrangement that is a DAO. We test this model against the case of “The DAO”, an early experiment in decentralized autonomous organization, which was forced to be stopped after a hacker stole around 50 Million USD in ETH tokens in 2016. The case history and its effects on actors in and outside “The DAO” highlight important aspects to be considered in judging the efficiency of governance structures of DAOs and related transaction costs. Results indicate that especially in situations of crisis, transaction costs rise again and that people are not as far at the margins of the corporate governance as the concept of a DAO proposes.},

  abstract={The fifth-generation (5G) mobile systems are considered as a promising infrastructure to provide connectivity for massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices leading to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), i.e., smart manufacturing. The smart manufacturing is characterized by capabilities of digitization, smartization, and connectivity for manufacturing operations and machinery where a huge amount of data has to be processed within ultralow latency. Since the machinery is limited in computing performance, the data generated by the machinery should to be offloaded to the network for process and storage. In this circumstance, the multi-tier multi-access edge computing (mMEC), one of the most important 5G technologies, demonstrate its advantages for data handling within the aforementioned smart-manufacturing requirements. In this paper, we present the mMEC architecture and investigate its role in the Industry 4.0. Moreover, the challenges of utilizing the mMEC in the smart factory are discussed in order to identify future research trends.},

The primary advantage of this model is not only taking into account trends, seasonal factors and cycle effect but also that reflects the realistic situation of the consumption of professional baseball, therefore, to bring about more accurate short-term forecasting. Based on estimated results, it was amazing for us that game attendance didn't be affected by GDP. And the impact of game-fixing scandal occurred in 1997 is harmful to game attendance, so the Chinese professional baseball league faced a subsequent attendance slump. Furthermore, in accordance with the model forecasting results, a directional path was precise forecast from 2009 to 2010 period belonging to in-sample forecast. Finally, we gain out-of-sample forecasts that attendance is increasing directionally in the future five years.

  abstract={The potential of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to reduce on-board system costs in autonomous vehicles through shared intelligence is considerable. However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.},

  abstract={Blockchains have enabled a slew of new opportunities, to create decentralized software and organizations. Riding on its tailcoats, we want to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) headed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a world where human error is majorly becoming the sole reason for mistakes, as small as a missed medication to huge ones like Chernobyl, it is becoming increasingly important to automate as many actions as possible. Creating automated organizations is only but a first step towards the goal. We decided to make an art organization which sells art to make money. The standard way of doing that would be to create a web platform like Amazon (controlled by humans) that sells art and let human artists upload their artwork. But in the interest of keeping this as automated as possible; we have decided to make a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which generates art. Our organization will sell this art created by the GAN and use the revenues to pay for its resources. An AI will be heading it. Hence the DAO will be an entirely human less organization capable of sustaining itself.},

  abstract={Structured data analysis has historically achieved remarkable success. However, the analysis of massive amounts of unstructured video data is still a challenging problem. Over one billion people use YouTube, a Google corporation, which generates billions of views. YouTube data is being created in extremely large quantities, and with a massive demand to store, analyze, and carefully study large amounts of data to make it usable for big data analytics. For the analysis of these YouTube data, the absence of YouTube Shorts which has become a current trend is the limitation. To address this limitation, YouTube Shorts along with traditional duration videos have been considered for analysis in this work. For analyzing these data, various Machine Learning (ML) techniques like clustering and classification have been considered to categorize the content creators into three different categories such as highly rated, moderately rated and lowly rated. These ratings for recommendation assist content creators in enhancing the value of their brand and the users are benefited by consuming, exchanging shares and promoting the content. The results observed show that the accuracy of the Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting classifiers have equivalent performance i.e., around 98% which are suitable for the above recommendation system. Hence, the objective to encourage investors and fans to become active stakeholders and owners of the creator’s micro-economy is addressed in this paper.},

  abstract={E-government system has greatly improved the efficiency and transparency of daily operations of a government. However, most of existing e-government services are provided in a centralized manner and heavily rely on human individuals to control. The highly centralized IT infrastructure is more vulnerable to outside attacks. Also, it is relatively easy to compromise the data integrity by inside rogue users. Furthermore, relying on individuals to monitor and control some of the working flows makes the system error-prone and leaves room for corruption. To address these challenges, we propose to use the blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to improve the e-government system. The blockchain-based DAO system works in a fully decentralized way and is immune to both outside and inside attacks. At the same time, operations of such system is only controlled by pre-defined rules; thus, the uncertainty and errors caused by human processes are greatly reduced. We provide a concrete use case to demonstrate the usage of DAO e-government and evaluate its effectiveness.},

  pages={195-202},
  abstract={One of the distinguishing features of blockchain-based Distributed Autonomous Organizations(DAO) is lack of a central authority. Changes to blockchain data is achieved through consensus amongst blockchain network participants, rather than through a central node's authoritative decision. Similarly, governance, i.e., changes to features and underlying source code, is achieved through a decentralized mechanism. As adoption of blockchain has increased, the need to evolve and adopt new features has grown. These changes highlight the mechanism by which the network, rather than a central node, makes decisions. One change in particular, proposed increases to the block size to address scalability limitations, has been particularly demonstrative of the governance mechanisms employed by disparate blockchains. For example, two digital currency projects, Bitcoin and Dash, employ significantly different governance mechanisms: the Dash Decentralized Governance By Blockchain (DGBB) process, and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, to decide what changes to make to their blockchains. Dash governance was able to decide to alter the block size in a matter of hours, while Bitcoin governance took several years to make the same decision. This paper evaluates the governance mechanisms of blockchain projects using the change in block size as an exemplar. Two prominent governance mechanisms are described, compared, and assessed based upon how effective they came to consensus and made the decision to change to support the disparate needs of stakeholders.},

  abstract={The new generation of digital intelligence technology enables knowledge creation, dissemination, and application to undergoing parallel changes. Scientific systems face an increasingly uncertain, diverse, and complex environment, making adopting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches to research issues inevitable. Existing scientific systems follow linear value streams, leading to problems, such as inefficiency, unfairness, and knowledge monopoly. Decentralized science (DeSci) is a new scientific development paradigm based on Web3, Metaverses, and decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs) technologies, that can solve organizational and management problems in scientific systems through organizing, coordinating, and executing techniques. However, new economic theories and methods are still needed to effectively solve the problem of linear value flow in scientific systems. Metaeconomics based on the parallel intelligence theory, also known as decentralized economics (DeEco), provides a new approach and idea for redesigning the economic system of scientific markets. Thus, this article proposes a research framework and core mechanisms of DeSci MetaMarkets based on parallel economic theory to provide effective and practical methodologies for scientific system governance.},

  abstract={Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAOs) have emerged as blockchain technology evolves beyond cryptocurrencies. Despite being the first project in this ecosystem, The DAO encountered a significant exploit due to inadequate implementation; nevertheless, it still paved the way for future projects. While decentralized autonomous organizations continue to thrive, there is a shortage of academic papers analyzing the associated risks. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively examine the current vulnerabilities in these organizations by systematically analyzing past attack incidents. 54 real-world events spanning from 2016 to July 2023 have been collected for identifying and summarizing major attack vectors. The results showcase that flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation, governance takeovers, and reentrancy issues are the critical vulnerabilities within this field. For further protection, this research also provides both general and specific countermeasures against each vulnerability, serving as an evaluation framework for both existing and future projects.},

  abstract={The rise of fifth-generation (5G) communication systems allows the super high-quality services to be implemented in real-life; however, it requires a massive amount of mobile data traffic to be simultaneously transmitted and processed. Fortunately, a significant percentage of mobile data traffic is indeed reusable and should be cached properly in somewhere, and then be delivered back to users' equipment (UEs) in the future requests. To proactively utilize this nature of content distribution, the caching techniques have attracted significant attention from the research community by alleviating unnecessary duplicated data transmission of popular content in mobile edge caching enabled networks. As a result, numerous scientific approaches under different perspectives have been published and hence should be categorized through specific criteria. In this study, we systematically and extensively survey the most recent caching techniques that were published. For each caching policy, we critically analyze its target in detail by performance metrics, including hit ratio, latency, and storage efficiency. Besides, we display the current trend by sorting them into common technical classes such as machine learning, deep learning, game theory, optimization techniques, etc. To visualize and predict the application of caching algorithms, in reality, we summarize their typical use cases.},

  abstract={Intelligent Vehicles (IVs), integrating sensing, communication, and computing technologies, have immense potential to elevate efficiency, reduce traffic accidents, and diminish emissions. However, since faulty decisions made by IVs may endanger the safety of people's lives and property, improper trust in these automated systems could potentially lead to significant risks and problems. The trust issues in IVs stems not only from technological immaturity but also from the inability of automation systems to handle complex social relationships. TRUE Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), underpinned by blockchain and smart contracts, propose a code-governed, trustworthy human-machine collaboration model, offering a promising approach to tackle those challenges. This paper introduces TAOs into IVs to propose an innovative human-machine collaboration system namely IV-TAOs, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness between humans and IVs. The architecture of IV-TAOs is formulated, with an exploration of both their characteristics and associated risk issues. This work provides a new perspective on addressing the trust issues encompassing but not confined solely within the context of intelligent vehicles.},

  abstract={the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) provides excellent security for e-transactions and other applications. However, in traditional PKI system, Private Key is often stored at central databases or inside distributed smart-cards and protected by password or PIN that may be lost, stolen, forgotten or guessed. Current trend for PKI system is to be based on physiological and behavioral characteristics of people, known as biometrics. But this approach still poses a threat which is the secrecy of template. Moreover, biometric based security system also faces some problems such as: noise in sensed data, intra-class variations, inter-class similarities, non-universality, spoofing attack’ In this paper, we propose a Multibiometric Encryption Key Algorithm to overcome the aforementioned issues by using Fuzzy Vault Scheme - a cryptosystem - which secures both the Private Key and multi-biometric templates. We also present the BioPKI system in which the algorithm is integrated. The experimental results with the system are encouraging.},

This notion of a level of autonomy is particularly important for consumer awareness as these autonomous devices and applications scale out to mass-market services. The societal impact from the operationalization of these technologies can be significant in terms of safety, security, privacy, and the consequences of failures.

  abstract={Nowadays, data has become more and more important. Most governments have passed laws to control how they are owned and used, such as the GDPR in Europe. However, any law is never perfect. We can see it when a company scattered around the world is hampered by the fact of not being able to exploit customer data outside the borders of a territory. Also, we can add that a data owner is not anymore once he sells them to a third party to be exploited. In this work, we propose a solution based on a permissioned blockchain, namely the Hyperledger Fabric, to allow any stakeholder with data to take part, with value providers, in creating Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAOs). Once created, a DAO can attract other investors to expand it. The Hyperledger Fabric handles this whole process through channels. The infrastructure needed to run the business of the DAO is generated automatically through special transactions taking place at the blockchain level. In the opposite direction, the cloud infrastructure sends notifications to the Hyperledger for traceability and monitoring purposes. Finally, through simulations of wealth distribution models, we show that to keep control of a DAO based on the proposed architecture, the shares must be negotiated according to a Pareto law.},

  abstract={Driven by the development of blockchain infrastructures and the promotion of Web 3, more than 4000 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been developed as online organizations jointly owned and managed by their members who work for the same interests. Voting mechanisms as the democratic administration of DAOs without the involvement of central authority, are crucial to both the development of the DAO community and the protection of individual interests. This paper is one of the first analyses of the critical role of voting mechanisms in DAOs’ operation. In the absence of systematic studies of voting mechanisms in DAOs, we propose five tiers of decentralization in DAO voting which marks the critical difference between DAO voting and conventional voting. We also define four dimensions to comprehensively evaluate the performance of DAO voting mechanisms, which identify the demands and characteristics of DAO voting and put forward clear design guidelines for voting mechanisms in DAOs. Finally, we take seven typical voting mechanisms as examples and analyze their performance in our proposed evaluation schemes.},

However, preexisting loopholes in FEC regulation allow for contributions to be made in situations that do not require donors to disclose their identity, a term coined as “dark money”. The increase of dark money in campaign financing and the ability of political spending to influence voter perspectives and decisions puts the credibility of the political finance system at stake. Additionally, with the introduction of blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts to political financing these technologies collectively can serve as a new vehicle for bad actors to use. In this paper, the effects of blockchain and smart contracts on political finance are examined through four use cases to demonstrate how these technologies can extend anonymous, foreign interference in political campaign financing and further cripple public trust in it.},

Large-scale infrastructure is increasingly a significant source of data on both its own operations as well as the society dependent on it. Big data from infrastructure can thus supply a variety of artificial and augmented intelligence systems. Large complex infrastructures typically require large complex organizations to operate and maintain. Such organizations though are typically centralized and constrained by bureaucratic policies and procedures. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are emerging that may provide better transparency, autonomy and decentralization for the manner in which these large-scale infrastructures are operated. The paper contrasts DAOs and ADSs before identifying the requirements for DAO administration of an ADS.},

  abstract={Blockchain is an emerging technology that finds applications across various industries by providing secure transaction records that cannot be tampered with. It operates as a decentralized and open ledger, offering additional benefits such as traceability and immutability, which greatly contribute to its desirability. Two important blockchain applications include Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) Marketplaces and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). NFTs are unique digital assets like artwork or music that can be bought and sold using cryptocurrency, ensuring both security and efficiency. On the other hand, DAOs are transparent organizations that make decentralized decisions. In our work, we have developed an integrated NFT marketplace and DAO that leverages NFT ownership to determine the weights of choices. The implementation is based on Ethereum ERC-721 tokens. However, the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm used in Ethereum 2.0 lacks fairness. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Delegated Reputation-based Proof of Elapsed Time consensus algorithm (DRPoET). Evaluations conducted on an Ethereum testbed demonstrate that our integrated DAO benefits from fair weights and improved transaction latency and fairness compared to the POS algorithm.},

  abstract={Due to the increasing performance and decreasing price of microcontrollers in recent years, applying a high sampling frequency has become more feasible in modern control that is known as multisampling technology. The first motivation to use multisampling is emulating the analog control, thereby reducing the control delay and improving the stability of power electronics controllers. On the other hand, more information can be acquired from the multisampled current/voltage, which helps to save the cost and improve the reliability. In this article, a review of the multisampling application in power electronics converters is provided. Starting from the control delay analysis in single/double-sampling control, the modeling, implementation, and related control strategies are given when using multisampling pulsewidth modulation. Then, based on the multisampled data, the applications in condition monitoring and parameter estimation are discussed. Finally, perspectives on challenges and future trends are discussed.},

  pages={2999-3006},
  abstract={The stability of LCL-type grid-connected converters in distributed power generation systems (DPGS) have been numerously investigated. It is well known that resonance of high-order filters may cause system oscillations and grid current distortion. This phenomenon is more critical when the DPGS contains capacitive loads and cables. Thus, it needs to consider the interaction effect between the equivalent grid impedance and the converter impedance, for which have been addressed by many innovative passivity methods. This paper reviews contributions and classifies of the existing passivity methods with different current controls as single-loop and multi-loop. Based on the concept of passivity, all passivity methods can guarantee the stability of the system by reshaping the output impedance. Several promising methods for different grid impedances are reviewed and evaluated. Finally, suggestions for implementing passivity and future trends are presented.},

  abstract={In the future, management in smart societies will revolve around knowledge workers and the works they produce. This article is committed to explore new management framework, model, paradigm, and solution for organizing, managing, and measuring knowledge works. First, the parallel management framework is presented that would allow for the virtual-real interactions of humans in social space, robots in physical space, and digital humans in cyberspace to realize descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive intelligence for management. Then, the management foundation models are proposed by fusing scenarios engineering with artificial intelligence foundation models and cyber–physical-social systems. Moreover, the new management paradigm driven by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations is formulated for the advancement of smart organizations and intelligent operations. On these basis, the management operating systems that highlight features of simple intelligence, provable security, flexible scalability, and ecological harmony are finally put forward as new management solution.},

  pages={23687-23699},
  abstract={A smart contract is known to be useful for automating business processes triggered by specific events caused by IoT sensors, data feeds, or other applications. A blockchain-based smart contract management system is an innovative technology that is foreseen to automate future business-to-business (B2B) processes. Blockchain is well-known to play a central role in business process re-engineering by optimizing business workflow operations, especially in multi-party arrangements. This paper presents a multi-organizational smart contract management system in which a user can create, deploy, and execute smart contracts. This paper consists of two parts; in the first part, we have compared existing smart contract management systems based on different characteristics that can play a vital role in selecting a particular system for a specific business need. In the second part, while utilizing and building upon the state-of-the-art techniques, we have built a framework for a blockchain-based smart contract and transaction management system. It is a unified architecture supporting DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and organizational level blockchain-based smart contract execution. There are two types of separate blockchains utilized in the proposed framework, i.e., SBlockchain and TBlockchain. SBlockchain is used to store smart contracts, whereas all the data generated by the smart contracts is stored inside the TBlockchain. In addition, each smart contract has some terms and clauses necessary for some event execution. Various components of the framework and their implementation have been described in detail with the help of relevant use-cases.},

  abstract={This article proposes a novel parallel management mode based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for enterprises by utilizing the artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution (ACP) approach, parallel intelligence theory, and blockchain technologies, to realize the distributed management of an enterprise. The artificial enterprise DAO (EnDAO) corresponding to the actual enterprise is constructed, and they constitute a parallel system via virtual–real interaction and parallel execution. Through the non-fungible token (NFT)-based incentive mechanism, metaverse-based virtual learning and training, as well as DAO-based distributed management and decision-making, the management and control of the actual enterprise as well as its employees can be carried out. By virtue of the virtual–real interactions of three types of employees, as well as the virtual–real feedback of three closed loops in the parallel systems, DAO-based parallel management for enterprises can realize descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence. On this basis, this article takes the recruitment-oriented key performance indicator (KPI) management of a startup technology enterprise as the case to introduce the operation processes and illustrate the superiorities of the proposed DAO-based enterprise parallel management mode.},

  year={2022},
  volume={02},

  pages={118-125},
  abstract={Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

  abstract={From AlphaGo to ChatGPT, the field of AI has launched a series of remarkable achievements in recent years. Analyzing, comparing, and summarizing these achievements at the paradigm level is important for future AI innovation, but has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we give an overview and perspective on machine learning paradigms. First, we propose a paradigm taxonomy with three levels and seven dimensions from a knowledge perspective. Accordingly, we give an overview on three basic and twelve extended learning paradigms, such as Ensemble Learning, Transfer Learning, etc., with figures in unified style. We further analyze three advanced paradigms, i.e., AlphaGo, AlphaFold and ChatGPT. Second, to enable more efficient and effective scientific discovery, we propose to build a new ecosystem that drives AI paradigm shifts through the decentralized science (DeSci) movement based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). To this end, we design the Hanoi framework, which integrates human factors, parallel intelligence based on a combination of artificial systems and the natural world, and the DAO to inspire AI innovations.},

The Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is one such empowering Web3 utility, and within this framework researchers and experts have the opportunity to implement and test their research results promptly on a small or large scale as required.

  abstract={With a growing complexity of the intelligent traffic system (ITS), an integrated control of ITS that is capable of considering plentiful heterogeneous intelligent agents is desired. However, existing control methods based on the centralized or the decentralized scheme have not presented their competencies in considering the optimality and the scalability simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose an integrated control method based on the framework of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The proposed method achieves a global consensus on energy consumption efficiency (ECE), meanwhile to optimize the local objectives of all involved intelligent agents, through a consensus and incentive mechanism. Furthermore, an operation algorithm is proposed regarding the issue of structural rigidity in DAO. Specifically, the proposed operation approach identifies critical agents to execute the smart contract in DAO, which ultimately extends the capability of DAO-based control. In addition, a numerical experiment is designed to examine the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results indicate that the controlled agents can achieve a consensus faster on the global objective with improved local objectives by the proposed method, compare to existing decentralized control methods. In general, the proposed method shows a great potential in developing an integrated control system in the ITS.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of intelligence and connectivity technology (ICT) has enhanced the efficiency and safety of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, this also increases the complexity of the transportation systems, especially the social complexity, and poses new challenges for their management. This paper discusses the emergence of social transportation, as part of natural evolutionary adaptation to new traffic conditions and technology, which is a paradigm shift from engineering-centered technical systems to society-centered ecosystems. In social transportation systems, all participants including administrators, individual travelers and other stakeholders play a more proactive role in the operation and management of transportation systems. Therefore, we propose to employ a decen-tralized autonomous organization (DAO) as a model for the social transportation system that allows participants to collaborate and coordinate without relying on a central authority. To meet the challenges brought by this transition, we propose to apply ACP-based parallel system theory to restructure the methodology of transportation management. Finally, we present a case study of personal carbon trading system where economic incentives are used to manage traffic demand, affecting others' travel behaviors, and reduce carbon emissions. In the conclusive remarks, we provide our visions and future directions of social transportation systems.},

  abstract={Research related to digital assets & ownership is currently rising along with the escalation utilization of Blockchain through various use cases and its derevatives, for example in facilitating Digital Assets in the form of virtual property (virtual houses / buildings and virtual land) in the Metaverse. These digital assets often have utilities, features, and even limited copies of quantities so that these digital objects have more value for specific users on a platform and even general people who are interested in and value them. To be able to preserve the value of digital assets in the Metaverse such as virtual property previously mentioned especially for transactions, a set of regulations/governance, as well as sustainable development in the future in the Metaverse is really needed so that the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in the metaverse is one way to maintain the sustainability of the ecosystem & market and its potential of virtual property. After conducting research for DAO development for virtual property transactions, starting with determining goals & purposes, breaking down the DAO focus object (virtual property), clustering relevant attributes, matching socio-economic impacts, and finally designing smart contracts & governance consensus, we obtained 4 main layers namely Consensus Governance, Smart Contract, Virtual Property & Socio-Economic.},

  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to invest in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The proposed DAO is entirely on-chain, where members can join to pool their funds transparently and securely. The structure of this decentralized platform will be distributed, allowing its members to propose and vote on investment decisions. The DAO's predefined investment strategy will focus on NFTs with a proven track record of successful growth or high potential for future. Additionally, before making any investments, extensive research investigations will be performed. Another potential feature of the proposed DAO platform is the ability to promote stakeholder participation through pre-defined NFTs, assuring active participation from members of the platform. The proposed DAO has the potential to transform NFT investing by promoting a more democratic and inclusive approach. Small investors who would otherwise be unable to participate in the NFT market might do so through this platform by pooling the financial resources. This proposed system incorporates blockchain technology to increase transparency and security, reduce the risk of fraudulent behavior or bad decision-making. This research work articulates the proposed DAO's technological and governance features by providing a road map for its effective development and implementation.},

  abstract={Smart cities have emerged as one of the most promising applications of cyber-physical systems (CPS), carrying the potential to serve the various interests of the public and private sectors at large. However, contemporary smart city infrastructure commonly uses heavily-centralized network architectures, reducing failure resilience and application flexibility. This centralization also imposes high barriers to entry for public access, limiting usage and oversight opportunities. To address these limitations, we describe Arbiter, a novel fog- and edge-based communication architecture based on the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Arbiter aims to improve the socioeconomic equity of the local citizenry by (1) acting as a management layer for citywide CPS assets, (2) providing a compliance layer for managing human capital, and (3) offering a data protection layer to ensure that citizens retain full control of their personal data. We then analyze in detail the technical, socioeconomic, and ethical implications of Arbiter, and contextualize its role in the modern smart city.},

At the same time, the high reliability of the power electronics products is demanded, in order to reduce the failure rates and ensure cost-effective operation of the renewable energy systems. This paper thus describes the basic concepts used in reliability engineering, and presents the status and future trends of Design for Reliability (DfR) in power electronics, which is currently undergoing a paradigm shift to a physics-of-failure approach. Two case studies of a 2 MW wind turbine system and a 6 kW photovoltaic system are presented to demonstrate the use of the DfR approach as a design tool to predict lifetime of components (e.g., power devices) as well as the overall systems (e.g., power converters) based on the required operating conditions (i.e., mission profile).},

Existing scientific systems, referred to as Centralized Science (CeSci), are built on centralized organizational structures and top-down institutional frameworks, which are lagging behind the development and practical requirements of AI4S. To address these limitations, AI4S needs to embrace a new scientific organizational and operational paradigm, namely Decentralized Science (DeSci). It can provide strong support to AI4S via effectively addressing issues such as information silos, biases, unfair distribution, and monopolies and promoting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans disciplinary cooperation in science. Based on these considerations, this paper presents the framework of AI4S based on DeSci and explores its potential application scenarios and research issues.

  abstract={Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology relies on wireless communication and coordination, aiming to improve road safety and traffic efficiency by orchestrating the interaction among the vehicles, infrastructures, and various entities. However, existing organizational and operational forms of V2X infrastructures encounter significant challenges, such as the capability to guarantee communication security, privacy, and efficiency especially when a centralized management system is used. The emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations (DAOs) present a solution to these challenges. DAOs embed managerial and operational protocols within a blockchain via smart contracts, facilitating smooth and efficient management of organizations without the necessity for centralized oversight. This letter introduces DAOs into the coordination of V2X infrastructures. Through a tripartite functional architecture including organization, coordination, and execution, we can achieve intelligent collaborative management among road infrastructures and vehicles. The DAO-secured V2X infrastructures are anticipated to augment the safety and efficiency of vehicular management in complex road scenarios, holding applicable potential for developing the intelligent roadways of tomorrow.},

A DAO-based cross-space collaborative perception system also enables data generation and interaction among these spaces. The letter addresses the security and privacy protection of the interaction data and the challenges of cross-regional cooperation caused by the privatization and centralization of data interaction protocols in the collaborative perception process. The letter analyzes the causes of these issues and explores a DAO-based cross-space collaborative perception system.

This paper proposes an IoV Information Management System (IIMS) based on parallel intelligence and blockchain to address these challenges. By leveraging the decentralized, immutable, and traceable nature of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanisms and collaborative models of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a secure and trustworthy data sharing platform is established for collaborative analysis, business cooperation, and innovative applications of IoV data. The proposed approach utilizes the decentralized nature and data backup capabilities of blockchain to mitigate the single point of failure issues associated with centralized servers. Additionally, the anonymity, immutability, and traceability features of blockchain ensure the privacy, security, and integrity of data sharing. Moreover, the incentive mechanisms and DAO solutions within the blockchain promote data sharing among vehicles while ensuring data quality.},

  abstract={Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a technical infrastructure and protocol that allows simultaneous access, verification, and updating of records in an irreversible manner over a network spanning multiple entities or locations. It can be a blockchain, Directed Acylic Graph, Hashgraph, Holochain, or Tempo (Radix).Blockchain uses an asymmetric cryptography mechanism to validate the authenticity of transactions. The hash function used here is a mathematical algorithm that converts any information into a string of alphanumeric values by a process called &#x201c;encryption.&#x201d; There are mainly two types of encryption &#x2013; asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption, depending on whether same or different keys are used for encryption and decryption.Decentralized identifiers (DID) allow unique, private, and secure peer&#x2010;to&#x2010;peer connections between two parties on a blockchain. DIDs are independent of centralized registries, authorities, or identity providers, which enable identity&#x2013;owner control and sovereignty over identities.There have been several innovations around blockchain consensus mechanisms, constitutional design, development of smart contracts, and tokens. Earlier, applications were mainly restricted to digital currencies, which were used in commercial transactions. The extension of Blockchain 2.0 applications enabled smart&#x2010;contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Blockchain 3.0 was able to register its presence in areas, such as education, health, science, transportation, and logistics; and now Blockchain 4.0 is evolving as a business&#x2010;friendly ecosystem for the world of commons.},

  abstract={Blockchain is being praised as a technological innovation which allows to revolutionize how society trades and interacts. This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency. In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases - Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology has become a promising approach in many domains. It first came up with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, where it is used to maintain a distributed ledger, a public list of all transactions. It is assumed that the use of a blockchain as a cryptocurrency, or in general for financial services, was just the first stage, called Phase 1.0. The second phase began with the integration of smart contracts. In Phase 3.0, the focus lies on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which efficiently implement smart contracts. In the future, it is assumed, that by the use of DAOs many benefits for the public sector emerge. In this paper, blockchain applications of Phase 2.0 and 3.0 are analyzed for measuring instruments under legal control. An example are smart meters, where by smart contracts, a new coin/token within the blockchain can be created whenever the electric meter rotates. Promising areas of application in legal metrology, like a decentralized audit trail to log, e.g., software updates and hinder uncertified manipulations, the complete automation of the legally supervised update mechanism by smart contracts, or an alternative to public key infrastructures are being proposed in this paper.},

  abstract={Recently, we have witnessed a trend that many industries are forming consortiums and attempting to accelerate efficiency and reduce cost by using blockchain technology. Nevertheless, there is a clear missing capability of cross-industry and cross-blockchain interoperability. Currently, most blockchain business networks operate in isolation without external data transfer or multi-blockchain interactions. For blockchain technology to ultimately deliver on its promise, blockchain networks must be able to scale from networks addressing individual business processes to very large scale networks of interconnected decentralized autonomous organizations addressing much larger business problems at the level of entire industries and across industries. In this paper, we envision the inception of Internet of Blockchains (IoB), where homogeneous and heterogeneous decentralized networks communicate to facilitate cross-chain transactions of value, data and state transition. In addition, we also discuss interledger techniques that are essential for enabling industry-scale blockchain networks as well as achieving scalable interconnectivity between disparate, distributed ledgers.},

  abstract={The use of blockchains is growing every day, and their utility has greatly expanded from sending and receiving crypto-coins to smart-contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations. Modern blockchains underpin a variety of applications: from designing a global identity to improving satellite connectivity. In our research we look at the ability of blockchains to store metadata in an increasing volume of transactions and with evolving focus of utilization. We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse.},

  abstract={Blockchain has become one of the hottest research areas in recent years. The technology could potentially lead to a new generation of decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous organizations. Unfortunately, there is simply too much misinformation regarding blockchain. Most notably, blockchain has been used as a buzzword synonymous with data immutability and trust. In fact, this is far from the truth. In this article, we provide a concise description of exactly what blockchain technology is, including its design principle, building blocks, core innovations, and benefits. This is followed by an analysis of data immutability. We show that to create an insurmountable barrier against attacks on data immutability, decentralization and system scale are both necessary. Based on this analysis, we further dissect what benefits private and consortium blockchain could actually offer when decentralization is removed. We show that private and consortium blockchain cannot offer data immutability and trust as many works in the literature have claimed or implied. Instead, the centralized version of blockchain technology provides an elegant solution to achieving fault tolerance and atomic contract execution, which could make private and consortium blockchain useful for enterprises that would like to provide high availability to their customers and for their internal operations.},

As governance issues can lead to human problems, they can impact the proper functioning of the blockchain, leading to loss of cryptocurrency value, hard forks, and even failure of the project. We choose several fail-safe mechanisms and processes used and tested in existing Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work implementations in combination with one another in order to create a framework in line with the philosophy of decentralization of the blockchain and safe against the most common technical and governance pitfalls of the field. Additionally, this composite framework offers ideal circumstances for the creation and success of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations by giving their creators more incentive to start new projects, and more involvement with the governance of the underlying blockchain.},

  abstract={Rapidly growing distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have recently received attention among researchers in both industry and academia. While a lot of existing analysis (mainly) of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks is available, the lack of measurements for other crypto projects is observed. This article addresses questions about tokenomics and wealth distributions in cryptocurrencies. We analyze the time-dependent statistical properties of top cryptocurrency holders for 14 different distributed ledger projects. The provided metrics include approximated Zipf coefficient, Shannon entropy, Gini coefficient, and Nakamoto coefficient. We show that there are quantitative differences between the coins (cryptocurrencies operating on their own independent network) and tokens (which operate on top of a smart contract platform). Presented results show that coins and tokens have different values of approximated Zipf coefficient and centralization levels. This work is relevant for DLTs as it might be useful in modeling and improving the committee selection process, especially in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchains.},

To this end, we propose a DeFACT framework for parallel manufacturing and Manufacturing 5.0, which focuses on safe, efficient and personalized collaborative production. In DeFACT, different enterprises and parallel workers (i.e., digital, robotic and biological workers) are organized, coordinated and scheduled based on decentralized autonomous organizations and operations to promote mutual benefits among members, even in the context of low or zero trust. This contributes to providing customers with higher-quality personalized products and services while ensuring the confidentiality and safeguarding of data. Additionally, various advanced technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence, scenarios engineering, and blockchain, are leveraged to achieve trustworthy and adaptable decision making, user-friendly human–machine interaction, and the federated control and management of parallel workers. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of DeFACT are experimentally validated through the design and implementation of three case studies.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={87-94},
  abstract={The emergence of blockchain technologies, including smart contracts, enables the decentralization of applications that were previously controlled by a single entity. In many cases, however, smart contracts still need to distinguish between different user roles according to their assigned duties. To ensure security, smart contracts often apply a simple form of role-based access control (RBAC), where a dedicated administrator assigns users to roles that are authorized to invoke specific smart contract functions. As this solution contradicts the blockchain principles of decentralization and democratic decision making, smart contracts may also form decentralized autonomous organizations where governance decisions are based on voting by all participants. Many applications would benefit from a hybrid approach that involves roles with different permissions while still allowing for collaborative management. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism for RBAC administration in smart contracts based on hierarchical roles and configurable administration rules for each role. Any change in the user-role relation requires joint approval by members of selected roles according to the associated rule. This enables decentralized organizational charts with flexible administration constraints, where each role corresponds to specific permissions in the decentralized application and any change is transparently and securely recorded on the blockchain. The practical feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by means of a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum blockchain. Several benchmarks are performed to analyze the potential overhead of different solution variants.},

  title={PureLottery: Fair Leader Election without Decentralized Random Number Generation}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={273-280},
  abstract={Given n participants, leader election (LE) is the process of designating one of them as the leader or coordinator. LE is ubiquitous in distributed computing and blockchain and has a wide variety of applications ranging from lotteries to proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a blockchain setting, we normally require our LE protocol to be decentralized, lead to a consensus about the elected leader, and be fair, i.e. elect each participant with the same probability $1 /n.$ Traditional blockchain LE solutions reduce the problem to decentralized uniform sampling from the set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}.$ This reduction leads to approaches which are either vulnerable to manipulation, or fail to guarantee fairness, or require inefficient procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), thus making them gas-inefficient and costly when implemented as smart contracts.In this work, we observe that fair leader election can be achieved without explicit decentralized random number generation (RNG). In other words, the intuition behind our work is that RNG is a strictly harder problem than LE. This is because every LE participant is assumed to prefer to be chosen as the leader, e.g. the participant prefers to win the lottery or be the miner for the next PoS block. Thus, they will refrain from actions that would reduce their chance of being selected. This game-theoretic incentive can be exploited to design much simpler protocols for LE in comparison to RNG, by ensuring that dishonest behavior can only reduce the winning chances of the participant.Specifically, we propose PureLottery, a protocol inspired by single-elimination knockout tournaments in sports such as football. We show that PureLottery selects the winner uniformly at random and provides strong game-theoretic guarantees to incentivize honest behavior. PureLottery is also strongly bias-resistant in the sense that every honest participant is guaranteed to win the lottery with probability at least $1 /n$, even if an adversary controls all of the other $n -1$ players. In other words, dishonest behavior will never increase an adversary’s chances of being elected, even if the adversary controls all but one of the participants. Finally, PureLottery is a simple protocol that can be efficiently implemented as a smart contract and uses a small amount of gas in practice. We provide an open-source implementation of the protocol, dedicated to the public domain with no copyright.},

  abstract={Without a doubt the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has been gaining attention over the last years. With the deployment of low cost sensors, a plethora of information is made available, giving rise to intelligent systems that combine data from multiple sources. Multiple IoT platforms have been developed to support different application domains such as smart cities, health, industry 4.0, etc. However, the vertical focus and usually isolated development of such platforms pose difficulties in offering cross-domain smart applications to meet society's needs. To this end, interoperability frameworks have emerged to allow the interplay of different platforms as well as the formation of federations among the entities contributing IoT devices through such platforms. The decentralized nature of IoT data federations presents challenges when it comes to their management and governance, particularly in ensuring fairness, security, trustworthiness and transparency among its members. However, permissioned blockchain-based solutions hold significant potential in addressing these issues due to their inherent characteristics. In this work, we propose a blockchain solution based on the Hyperledger Fabric for the decentralized management of IoT federations and their gover-nance by utilizing voting-based configurable rules that abide to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The solution includes smart contracts for the secure creation and management of federations exposed through APIs, as well as a voting application for enabling the DAO dynamic. Our solution demonstrates a secure, trustworthy and transparent way for the formation and membership control of IoT federations, that holds potential for extension with smart contracts related to data marketplace, as well as reputation and tokenization mechanisms.},

  abstract={Charity giving is a fundamental aspect of society, but there are concerns about the accountability and transparency of the donation process. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potential solution, offering a secure and auditable platform for managing charitable contributions. In this paper, we explore the concept of empowering donors through blockchain technology and examine how it can help ensure that contributions reach the right recipients. We review existing literature on the topic and identify key areas for future research, including the development of hybrid blockchain solutions along with the implementation of novel consensus mechanisms. Moreover, providing the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations, self-executing smart contracts, and integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence and Internet of things. By providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field and outlining a roadmap for future research, we hope to stimulate further exploration of the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize charity giving, and create a more accountable and transparent system for managing charitable funds. Some research questions are designed for each novel idea. Our analysis suggests that blockchain has the potential to empower donors and ensure that their contributions make a positive impact in the world, but further research is needed to fully realize its potential.},

  abstract={Blockchain is hailed as a technological breakthrough that has the potential to change social transactions and interaction methods. This is largely because it allows mutually distrustful organizations to exchange information without relying on the financial value of trusted third parties and interacting parties. In addition, the blockchain provides integrity-protected system storage and data distribution. We examine if blockchain is a good idea and the finest possible solution for a certain application situation in this study. We offer a structured technique for determining the optimal technological option for a particular application scenario. Applying our framework, we explore three usage cases in depth: Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, and conclude the essay with a look forward to vast prospects.},

  abstract={Briefing: To tackle the complexity of human and social factors in manufacturing systems, parallel manufacturing for industrial metaverses is proposed as a new paradigm in smart manufacturing for effective and efficient operations of those systems, where Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSSs) and the Internet of Minds (IoM) are regarded as its infrastructures and the “Artificial systems”, “Computational experiments” and “Parallel execution” (ACP) method is its methodological foundation for parallel evolution, closed-loop feedback, and collaborative optimization. In parallel manufacturing, social demands are analyzed and extracted from social intelligence for product R&D and production planning, and digital workers and robotic workers perform the majority of the physical and mental work instead of human workers, contributing to the realization of low-cost, high-efficiency and zero-inventory manufacturing. A variety of advanced technologies such as Knowledge Automation (KA), blockchain, crowdsourcing and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) provide powerful support for the construction of parallel manufacturing, which holds the promise of breaking the constraints of resource and capacity, and the limitations of time and space. Finally, the effectiveness of parallel manufacturing is verified by taking the workflow of customized shoes as a case, especially the unmanned production line named FlexVega.},
