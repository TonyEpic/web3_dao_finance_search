  abstract={With the rapid development of the transportation industry, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) tries to adapt to industry changes through constructing new organizational forms, management methods, and incentive mechanisms. However, many new governance issues have arisen due to the transportation system’s complexity, diversity, and uncertainty. DAO(Decentralized autonomous organization) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts are regarded as effective methods to solve the organizational governance problems for complex systems. Therefore, this article analyzes the main issues currently faced by ITS. Then, this paper proposed a 6-layer DAO structure framework for ITS and discussed its key research issues. Finally, a case study for the Macau transportation system is carried out, and further research directions are proposed. The DAO-based transportation system will represent the future trend of ITS development. This paper aims to motivate more discussion for this new direction and provide helpful guidance and reference for future research work.},

  abstract={Decentralized autonomy is a long-standing research topic in information sciences and social sciences. The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organizations(DAOs) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts is regarded as an effective tool to solve corporate governance problems. It can minimize the contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, and other issues in corporate governance. However, DAOs also face a variety of governance issues, such as internal governance issues and external governance issues caused by the technical attributes of blockchain and smart contracts. DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions. We consider that parallel governance represents the future trend of DAO research and practice. This paper is aimed at stimulating further effort and providing helpful guidance and reference for future research works.},

  abstract={The 21st century has witnessed the unprecedented evolution of intelligent transportation systems, and the automotive industry is facing great challenges and opportunities. For the current research in vehicle maintenance, it overlooks issues related to data security and customized services, which have the pivotal role in the Industry 5.0 era. This letter, as a summary of the Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Sustainable Vehicular Ecology (DHW-SVE), discusses the DAO(decentralized autonomous organizations and operations)-based parallel maintenance, which aims not only to promote vehicular healthcare but also to facilitate data security. In addition, DAO will enable parallel maintenance with the capability of providing customized services that are closely aligned with the consumers' preferences, offering them safe and unique experiences. Driven by the decentralized mechanism, parallel maintenance will pave the way for a future that prioritizes human demands and welcomes human-oriented collaborative governance.},

  abstract={Autonomous connected vehicles are revolutionizing the automotive industry vision and impacting their business model. This trend will likely impact other related industries and their business model such as automotive insurance companies, tier-II automotive manufactures, and automotive maintenance service companies. The growing number of connected vehicles will require new policy formulation by the government about privacy and security issues in the era of massive digitalization and automation. Organizations such as 3GPP and IEEE are evolving standards that address security issues for connected vehicles. However, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will play a significant role in 5G networks and beyond, we address the privacy and security issues with a blockchain-based intelligent digital forensics system for autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) in a connected smart world incorporating artificial intelligence. The proposed system includes a novel algorithm for the autonomous connected vehicles and the users' security and privacy. We utilize short randomizable signatures to anonymously authenticate witness's identities and to protect the witnesses' privacy. Then, we leverage fine-grained access control based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for evidence access and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system by simulating the proposed model, its computational costs and communication overhead by implementing a prototype on a local Ethereum blockchain network platform. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed system. We envision the application of the proposed system to ensure security and privacy of ACVs and their security applications for use with 5G-V2X and future XG-V2X networks.},

  abstract={Inspiration in nature has been widely explored, from macro to micro-scale. Natural phenomena mainly considers adaptability, optimization, robustness, organization, among other properties, to deal with complexity. When looking into chemical phenomena, stability and organization are two properties that emerge. Recently, artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN), a supervised learning method inspired in the inner structures and mechanisms of chemical compounds, have been proposed as a data-driven approach in artificial intelligence. AHN have been successfully applied in data-driven approaches, such as: regression and classification models, control systems, signal processing, and robotics. To do so, molecules -the basic units of information in AHN-play an important role in the stability, organization and interpretability of this method. Until now, building the architecture of AHN has been treated as a whole entity; but distributed computing mechanisms, as well as the exploitation of hierarchical organization of molecules, can enhance the performance of AHN. Thus, this paper aims to discuss challenges and trends of artificial hydrocarbon networks as a data-driven method, with emphasis on packaging, distributed computing and hierarchical properties. Throughout this work, it presents a description of the main insights of AHN and the proposed distributed and hierarchical mechanisms in molecules. Potential applications and future trends on AHN are also discussed.},

  abstract={Although economical and technological progress has made societies more prosperous, it has also created drawbacks such as poverty and unemployment, and not every member of these societies is happy. The dissatisfaction has led to questions and the re-examination of the top-down approach of central government for planning and management. Recently a new type of society has been postulated, in which the happiness of the individual has importance as well as the prosperity of the group. This new trend will come about through a structural change in society itself. Such a restructuring will be accelerated by information technologies, including the Internet/Intranet, which have been rapidly advancing. Global communication networks enable global communication among individuals and eliminate traditional borderlines around organizations and countries; that is, information sent by each individual flows all over the world and an individual can choose the information he/she needs. The name for the above new trend in the structural change of society is "Autonomous Decentralization" and the author believes that the Autonomous Decentralized System (ADS) (K. Mori et al., 1986) will become quite a common technology in every section or every level of society, such as companies, industries, and public organizations. The paper describes the effectiveness of applying ADS technologies to the structure of our new society and indicates the future trend of ADS technologies.},

  abstract={The evolution of modern mobile terminals, social networks, and other intelligent services makes everyone become a ubiquitous information perceiver, producer, and propagator. Also known as “social sensor” and “social IoT,” these individuals and communities generate a huge volume of social signals, which has shown prominent value for mining. These unstructured social signals provide a new perspective in the research of complex systems, which makes the traditional cyber–physical system (CPS)-oriented information computing sublimate to the cyber–physical–social system (CPSS)-oriented knowledge computing. However, there still exist great uncertainties, ambiguities, and complexities in modeling behaviors of social individuals or groups. Especially when we apply big-data-driven learning-based models in specific fields and scenarios, the lack of domain expert knowledge and characteristics of system uncertainty severely limits the performance and accuracy of these models. The introduction of fuzzy system modeling integrates data and knowledge in the social computing area, which has shown its unique advantages in solving the above issues and has drawn more attention to this topic. In this article, we conduct a review of recent advances in social computing with fuzzy technologies in CPSS. First, we briefly review the development of social computing, and analyze the characteristics and advantages of social computing through fuzzy methods. Second, we refine core fuzzy system methods for social computing and elaborate on existing fuzzy-technology-empowered social computing methodologies. As in a range of social spaces, we also review and analyze related advances in human-in-the-loop systems. We also reveal the trend of decentralized, autonomous, and organized computing in cyber–physical–social space with fuzzy-based methods and proposed a framework to categorize related studies in CPSS. Finally, we conclude the research trends and hotspots based on current studies, and discuss the challenges for future research directions.},
