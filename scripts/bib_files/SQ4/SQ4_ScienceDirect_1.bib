abstract = {This paper introduces a novel decentralized control design procedure for an aeroelastic morphing wing. The control goal is active damping of this flexible system. The model is developed as a multi-agent system with inherent interconnections between the agents. The control system then takes advantage of the model structure and interconnections rather than relying on the entire system's model. This brings benefits, especially with a growing number of agents where the control design dimension remains low. Therefore, the proposed control design is especially suitable for morphing wings with a large number of actuation points. The result is presented in the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) form. A numerical example shows the application of the proposed algorithm.}

This paper provides an in-depth study of DAOs by analyzing their definitions, characteristics, and emerging developments. Existing definitions in the literature hardly recognize common functionalities and intermingle coded DAOs, DAO deployment platforms, and blockchain DAOs. We developed a comprehensive DAO definition by reviewing the literature and empirically analyzing 1,859 DAOs. The findings show that many DAOs were inactive and that a threshold of 20 tokenholders is a tipping point for DAOs to survive over time and maintain sustained levels of activity. Finally, based on an empirical analysis of 9,845 perceived DAOs, we identified the emerging development of off-chain voting. This emerging development challenges the autonomous nature of DAOs. We recommend further research to investigate the effect of governance structures on their long-term sustainability and viability for both on-chain and off-chain DAOs.}

abstract = {In recent years the concept of “organization” has been gradually accepted as a suitable abstraction for the development of open multi-agent systems with dynamic agents. By modelling interactions based on roles, this abstraction allows an organization to be modelled independently of its participating agents so as to support agent dynamicity. A natural requirement from the abstraction is that agents need to be “organization aware”—that is they must be able to inquire, import, and execute roles from the organization. However, how to adequately support those processes in a decentralized and dynamic environment is still an open issue. This paper addresses this problem by presenting ATALK, a novel decentralized agent middleware that fulfills the above requirements. A role component model is designed to facilitate role deployment, reflection and uniform role interaction. In order to support role dynamicity, a compositional agent architecture allowing dynamic role integration and enactment is proposed. Moreover, ATALK allows agents to hand over their role to other agents of a same organization with their run-time states. Thus, agents can dynamically relinquish their roles without jeopardizing the normal execution of the organization. This paper also evaluates our design and current prototypic implementation through both qualitative analysis and simulations. Our results show that ATALK achieves remarkable organization reconfigurability with little additional overhead.}

As the trend moves towards decentralized social networks, diverse approaches are explored, becoming crucial tools for defining trust and privacy in individuals’ personal lives during uncertain environments. Blockchain’s transformative role reaches beyond finance, revolutionizing how we establish trust and privacy in our interconnected digital societies. Concurrently, researchers recognize the efficacy of trust models in enhancing the security and reliability of social networks applications. However, a comprehensive review of recent advancements in trust models based on blockchain for social networks is lacking. To address this gap, our survey takes a comprehensive perspective on the theme of trust within decentralized networks. We examine various concepts such as the trust concept itself, trust models, trust prediction methodologies, decentralization in trust-based social networks, and the role of blockchain in fortifying trust and security in social networks. We investigate the intersection of trust and blockchain technology, encompassing concepts, types of blockchain, and their applications in social networks. These models are categorized based on different parameters, and we examine both their advantages and limitations. Finally, we propose prospective paths for researchers interested in exploring this area.}

Therefore, the object of the research is a cyber-physical material flow system with flexible, autonomous and collaborative vehicles combined with centralized sensors to digitalize the workspace. Furthermore, the number of vehicles in the system can be adjusted to the volume of the transport requirement, wherefore the system is suitable for different tasks in the intralogistics. The sustainability of this concept is given by two aspects. On the one hand by the individual path planning of each task also of small parts. On the other hand by the re-use of the system at changing transport volumes or requirements.}

abstract = {This paper applies the politics of scale as a framework to examine how decentralization reforms and the associated power relations between government agencies at different levels affected disaster risk outcomes in Thailand, particularly during the 2011 floods in Central Thailand. It argues that Thailand's decentralization has been incomplete due to the retention of power and resources by central bureaucrats and the continued weak capacity of local administrative organizations (LAOs). In addition, the country's overall fragmented and politically polarized governance has hindered policy coherence at all levels, including the local level. Incomplete decentralization alongside persistent fragmentation along ministerial and sectoral lines has undermined disaster governance and distributed risks unevenly and unfairly. The governance weaknesses visibly materialized during the 2011 floods. Except for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), LAOs once again had insufficient capacity to effectively respond to the floods and were given insufficient assistance by the central government. The central government sought to monopolize power, did not consult local communities, had limited capacity to enforce all of its decision, distributed risks unevenly, and overall performed poorly. Similarly, the BMA dominated other much smaller local government units within and beyond its formal boundaries.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

The proposed system is developed as an inference engine while having a number of interesting features. First, the system validates and audits the decision-making process while sharing and recording the input data and the computed outcomes in a synchronized trusted manner. Second, the system allows the formation of distributed AI repository that can absorb and manage concurrent use-cases while targeting different scopes and covering diverse AI branches. Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data. A case study of estimating the construction cost for road projects is provided to illustrate the system’s workability and demonstrate its performance.}

For that reason, an alternative, fully decentralised agent behaviour model was developed and compared to the hybrid one. Through simulated experiments, it was found that the decentralised agent behaviour model achieved much higher responsiveness; however, it required additional spare capacity to compensate for its decision-making imperfections.}

Ethereum thus enables global, unincorporated associations to conduct governance experiments. Such experiments are crucial to Decentralised Finance (DeFi). DeFi is a nascent field of unlicensed, unregulated, and non-custodial financial services that utilise public distributed ledgers and crypto-assets rather than corporate structures and sovereign currencies. The inaugural Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index, launched in August 2021, included nine Ethereum-based projects – non-custodial exchanges as well as lending and derivatives platforms. Each project is governed, at least in part, by unregistered holders of tokenised voting rights (also known as governance tokens). Token-holders typically vote for or against coders’ improvement proposals that pertain to anything from the allocation of treasury funds to a collateral’s risk parameters. DeFi’s governance thus depends on the distribution and exercise of tokenised voting rights. Since archetypal DeFi projects are not managed by companies or public institutions, not much is known about DeFi’s governance. Regulators and law-makers from the United States recently asked if DeFi’s governance entails a new class of “shadowy” elites. In response, we conducted an exploratory multiple-case study that focused on the tokenised voting rights issued by the nine projects from Bloomberg’s inaugural Galaxy DeFi index. Our mixed methods approach drew on Ethereum-based data about the distribution, trading, staking, and delegation of voting rights tokens, as well as project documentation and archival records. We discovered that DeFi projects’ voting rights are highly concentrated, and the exercise of these rights is very low. Our theoretical contribution is a philosophical intervention: minority rule, not “democracy”, is the probable outcome of token-tradable voting rights and a lack of applicable anti-concentration laws. We interpret DeFi’s minority rule as timocratic.}

Whereas centralized scheduling might find a global throughput optimum (even at high computational and implementation cost), decentralized scheduling decisions in a multi-agent system are much more manageable and agents are more robust to handle any interruptions that might take place on the production floor. Compared to a centralised architecture, the development, testing and commissioning is definitely more complex, as it requires the availability of the physical units. Yet these aspects are not visited frequently by research activities. This paper details a novel implementation approach of a multi-agent based production control, that was developed for a lab-contained production environment that serves as test-bed for decentralized scheduling algorithms, with both a nominal operational mode and a simulation mode. The latter one is introduced to ease up the deployment process of the system. The description of the new approach is illustrated with different examples.}

In the model, the central government makes transfers to local governments to offset vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances. But the anticipation of transfers lowers local governments’ expected cost of borrowing and leads to overborrowing ex ante. Absent commitment, the central government over-transfers to reduce local governments’ future need to borrow, and in the equilibrium both local and central debts are inefficiently high. Consistent with empirical evidence, when fiscal decentralization widens vertical fiscal imbalances, local governments become more reliant on transfers, and both local and central debts rise. Applied to Spain, the model explains 39 percent of the rise in total government debt when the vertical fiscal imbalances widened during 1988–1996, and 18 percent of the fall in debt when the imbalances narrowed during 1996–2006.}

PKI comprises digital certificates managed by the certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the user’s identity, thus providing secure communication channels. However, the security of PKI is profoundly reliant on the reliability of these third-party CAs, which serves as a single point of failure for PKI. Over the past, there have been several incidents of popular CA breaches, where the centralized operation model of CAs caused numerous targeted attacks due to the spread of rogue certificates. In this paper, we aim to make the CA pool completely decentralized and concurrently build our decentralized solution cooperative with established PKI standards (i.e., X.509) for effective real-world integration. In particular, we harness blockchain technology to propose a decentralized PKI framework named ProofChain, which provides complete trust among a decentralized group of CAs. Our proposed solution provides all the traditional X.509 PKI operations (i.e., registration, validation, verification, and revocation), making it compatible with existing PKI standards. We have also evaluated ProofChain against popular security standards (i.e., the CIA triad model) and PKI adversarial attacks. Besides, to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed system, we have also evaluated the performance of the ProofChain by implementing it on the private testbed of the Ethereum network across various real-world PKI scenarios.}

Firstly, this paper contributes to the body of literature by discussing the most influential countries, authors, subject areas and journals of the current blockchain research. Secondly, this paper identifies six main clusters of blockchain-related research contributions and, based on the analysis on centrality and density measures, it classifies research themes in motor themes, basic themes, emerging or disappearing themes, and specialised themes. Despite the majority of contributions belong to the computer science subject area, many papers belonging to the technology management subject area provide pivotal insights for practitioners and policy makers.

The policy impacts are most pronounced in eastern regions and counties with higher initial agglomeration level. While the effect on economic development is insignificant in middle and western regions, it greatly expanded local bureaucracy size in these areas. I discuss the potential channels of policy effects under a simple decentralization framework with heterogeneous regions. These findings suggest that decentralization might generate entirely different consequences, relying on the level of local development potential. For this reason, it is important for the policy makers to fully take into account regional heterogeneity in optimizing decentralization policy.}

abstract = {Recent years have seen the emergence of several new manufacturing paradigms due to consumer demand for more customized, intelligent, and sustainable products and the explosive rise of the industrial Internet and cyber-physical technology leasing to the development of smart manufacturing systems. However, the quantification of several capabilities for smart manufacturing systems, such as decentralization, customization, interoperability, etc., is a matter of concern. The current research makes an attempt in this direction by questioning the need for this "multiplicity" of definitions and employs a methodical methodology to quantify the decentralization components to produce a coherent "blueprint" that justifies and integrates all of these many points of view. Further, a conceptual analysis of the model is made to discuss the alterations in the intelligence offerings with the enhancing implementation level of smart manufacturing systems. Based on the graphical analysis, the various level of organizational maturity with the enhancing smart manufacturing implementation is deliberated. The research provides significant directions to the managers to effectively plan, design, and execute the decentralization aspects with the increasing deployment level of smart manufacturing systems at a limited investment.}

This paper analyses panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2002 to 2017 to determine the impact of environmental decentralization on the synergy of pollution and carbon reduction in pig farming. The result shows that environmental decentralization has a significant ‘carbon reduction effect’ and ‘pollution reduction effect’ on pig farming; it is also conducive to promoting the synergistic effect of reducing pollution and carbon emissions through supporting environmental facilities and industrial organisations. Various types of environmental decentralization have significant differences in the synergy of pollution and carbon reduction. The scale of pig breeding plays a positive regulatory role in the impact of environmental decentralization on the synergy of pollution and carbon reduction while showing regional heterogeneity. This research is crucial for advancing the green transformation of pig breeding.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are mass-produced and designed for different applications, ranging from monitoring of the environment to on-demand electrical switches, and so on. These IoT devices are often heterogeneous in nature, only to receive updates at infrequent intervals, and can remain ‘out of sight’ on a home or office network for extended periods. In other words, security and privacy are two key (research and operational) challenges in IoT systems. In recent years, there have been attempts to design deep learning-based solutions to mitigate limitations associated with detection systems designed for typical operational technology (OT) systems, although a number of challenges remain. This paper proposes a federated-based approach that employs a deep autoencoder to detect​ botnet attacks using on-device decentralized traffic data. Through the suggested federated solution, privacy is addressed by ensuring the device’s data is not transferred or moved off the network edge. Instead, the machine learning computation itself is brought to where the data is born (i.e. the edge layer), with the added benefit of data security. We demonstrate that using our proposed model, we can achieve up to 98% accuracy rate in the anomaly detection when using features such as source IP, MAC-IP, and destination IP, etc., for training. The overall comparative performance analysis between our decentralized proposed approach and a centralized format demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy rate of attack detection.}

This paper develops a taxonomy based on a comprehensive literature analysis to systematically structure this emerging field. The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.}

This article adopts the regression discontinuity design (RDD) as well as stage heterogeneity influential mechanism analysis to study the nonlinear form and potential mechanisms of green investment in mitigating the ecological resource curse, based on provincial panel data of China from 2006 to 2020. The study findings indicate an inverted U-shaped curve in the linkage between green investment and pollution emission, with a turning point at 4.98. Moreover, the analysis of heterogeneity mechanisms reflects that local fiscal decentralization and resource dependence initially impede the effect of green investment on mitigating the ecological resource curse. Nonetheless, as green investment matures, the curse is primarily alleviated through substantive innovation in eco-friendly practices. By investigating the regional and resource endowment heterogeneity, it is obvious that inland and non-resource-based regions are more inclined to benefit from green investment in alleviating the environmental resource curse. Thus, this paper proposes certain policy recommendations tailored to regional characteristics, such as fostering a greener consumption mindset and minimizing industry reliance in resource-based zones.}

abstract = {Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new arising terminology of network architecture with outstanding features of orchestration by decoupling the control plane and the data plane in each network element. Even though it brings several benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the single point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down all network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can access to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation owing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the Northbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network topology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even worse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller. Hence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN’s Northbound. Furthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during data exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations, we introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized authentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to assist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With strict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for each request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing over-privileged activities or security policy conflicts. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we also implement a prototype of this framework to evaluate the security impact, effectiveness, and performance through typical use cases.}

We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.}

This work proposes a decentralized personal data management system for banking sector using block chain which makes sure that the user can control their personal data in their own .It presents a Privacy-Protected Blockchain network in which all data is encoded within a controlled time period. Despite the fact that the data is available in the past, this design can successfully preserve user privacy and protect from deceivers, providing the data more stable and healthier. Blockchain has its advantages over features such as transparency, decentralization and immutability. In the proposed model, a protocol is implemented which converts the blockchain into automated access control manager. There is no need for a third party to be trusted for the implementation of this model. In the proposed system, the transactions are not limited to financial transactions like Bitcoin, it also includes data storing, sharing and querying. Hence, the use of blockchain could reduce the overly concern about securing and compartmentalizing the data.}

In this paper, we report how team autonomy is maintained at Spotify at scale, based on team retrospectives, interviews with team managers and archival analysis of corporate databases and work procedures. In particular, we describe how managerial authority is decentralized through various workgroups with collective authority, what compromises are made to team autonomy to ensure alignment and which team-related factors can further hinder autonomy. Our findings show that scaled autonomy at Spotify does not mean anarchy, or unlimited permissiveness. Instead, squads are expected to take responsibility for their work and coordinate, communicate and align their actions with others, and comply with a few enabling constraints. Further, squads take many decisions independently without management control or due to collective efforts that bypass formal boundary structures. Mechanisms and strategies that enable self-organization at Spotify are related to effective sharing of the codebase, achieving alignment, networking and knowledge sharing, and are described to guide other companies in their efforts to scale autonomy.}

Virtual power plants (VPPs) have emerged as an important paradigm for aggregating and managing numerous DERs. This paper proposes a decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) multilayer energy trading framework to facilitate optimized coordination of DERs within a VPP context. A control center, prosumers, and service operators constitute the model’s multi-layered architecture. Profits from feed-in tariffs, ancillary services, and P2P sales are optimized for revenue while expenses are minimized using a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Smart contracts enable prosumers to trade energy units in the Ethereum blockchain with ease via a participatory web platform. The effectiveness of the framework in synchronizing power supply and demand within the VPP by coordinating the charging and discharging of storage systems in accordance with consumption patterns is demonstrated through performance evaluation. In contrast to conventional centralized architectures, the proposed framework utilized decentralized architecture efficiently consolidates and optimizes distributed energy resources (DERs) to improve grid stability and renewable energy utilization.}

However, the outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted this practice, forcing universities to prioritize the safety of individuals during exams. In response, a shift to online assessments occurred, bringing forth new challenges such as academic dishonesty and inadequate infrastructure. This study presents a novel approach to decentralized in-person exams for geographically dispersed students. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed, followed by a mixed-integer linear reformulation, to optimally determine the scheduling of exams, test center locations, and student allocation, while addressing the incorporation of both hard and soft constraints. Given the complexity of the problem, we have implemented meta-heuristic algorithms to solve larger instances, including genetic and simulated-annealing algorithms. Additionally, we have devised a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of population-based and local-search algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we used real data collected from our department during the fall semester of 2022. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the hybrid algorithm compared to others, in terms of both effectiveness and adaptability. It remains consistent across different scenarios, effectively addressing real-world complexities. Finally, a comparison between centralized and decentralized scenarios underscores the advantages of the latter approach during the pandemic.}

abstract = {With rapid industrialization over the Asian-Pacific coastal region, sustainable management has received increased levels of attention. The way to construct the sustainable management mode suitable for local characteristics becomes an important issue; it requires an in-depth understanding of local management practices changes and historical culture. In this respect, there is a lack of comprehensive discussions on centralized/decentralized management pattern change for this region. Based on historical document analysis for the Jiangsu coast, we reconstruct the evolution of coastal management modes. Here we show that coastal management in Jiangsu has witnessed repeated transitions between centralized and decentralized mode, encompassing four periods: traditional management before the late 19th century, the decentralized practice in the early 20th century, the centralized management associated with the planned economic system from the 1950s–1980s, and the decentralized management in response to the adoption of a market economic system after the 1980s. The driving forces for the changes identified include geomorphological changes, population growth and social-economic regime shifts. We propose that, to optimize coastal management, a hybrid model should be established to take into account both centralized and decentralized components. Although coastal management is decentralization-oriented in most western countries, in the Asia-Pacific coastal regions, local conditions and historical features should be taken into account to adjust the balance between centralized and decentralized variables in the management. With the increasing attention to ecosystem health in China, together with future climate changes and population dynamics, the centralized component should be re-considered within the hybrid model.}

abstract = {Decentralized civic engagement, i.e. engagement which is not initiated and managed by government, has been often used as a popular slogan in various public speeches to highlight the importance of genuine civic interests in governance, yet offering very limited options on how to actually promote such involvement. The advent of the digital era has facilitated the development of a plethora of digital participatory platforms that could presumably help to boost the effective engagement of civic communities in decision making processes in an explicitly decentralized manner and, more so, the demand for such decentralized e-participation services is increasing during the current Covid-19 crisis. However, there is a real shortage of studies that directly focus on the analysis of such autonomous cases and all the more so from real life contexts in their natural settings. In this regard, this paper aims to fill the gap by analyzing the phenomena from an intrinsically peer-to-peer networking perspective, which could be observed today in popular autonomous civic engagement initiatives that have been launched in recent times in the area.}

To overcome this, rural areas have experimented with decentralised governance. However, this process is fraught with political, fiscal, and institutional difficulties. These often revolve around transparency and accountability issues and low participation rates. Blockchain technology could act as a social innovation to overcome issues in decentralised governance, and rural areas could even prove to be a fertile environment for future innovation. In this conceptual paper, the potential of blockchain technology is theoretically positioned in regional development discourses. After exploring how blockchain could be applied to rural governance and the barriers it needs to overcome to reach mass adoption, a new distributed model of governance is suggested.}

This provides modeling for renewable energy sources (RESs), electric vehicles (EVs), battery storage systems (BSS) and load. The desired and most favorable restoration path is found by the MAS, in which zone agents are dispersed across the distribution system. The MAS can also manage microgrids (MGs) overloaded as the unbalance operation of RESs, BSS, EVs, and load. This is realized by making a bridge between MGs and neighboring non-overloaded MGs. The suggested method adheres to voltage and power flow restrictions while operating according to expert system standards. The recommended approach is put to the test using a 33-bus radial distribution system. MATLAB calculations on agents and power flow are carried out in order to verify the validity of the choices made by agents. The proposed restoration plan is able to obtain the best power supply path with a low number of switching in the event of a fault so that the voltage magnitude is higher than 0.9 p.u. and free capacity is available for the distribution lines. The smart charging strategy of EVs reduces 93% of their turn off compared to the non-smart charging strategy. However, if the CNMG plan is established, all vehicles can be powered.}

In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.}

In the nine changes studied across seven companies, the decentralization process also required the CPO to address a number of simultaneous activities, including cost reduction objectives and implementation of information technology systems. A surprising “purchasing paradox” was also uncovered as top management still expected decentralized supply units to provide additional savings.}

This paper demonstrates the feasibility and potential of employing SR to fight fires autonomously, with a focus on the self-coordination mechanisms for the desired firefighting behaviour to emerge. Thus, an efficient physics-based model of fire propagation and a self-organisation algorithm for swarms of firefighting drones are developed and coupled, with the collaborative behaviour based on a particle swarm algorithm adapted to individuals operating within physical dynamic environments of high severity and frequency of change. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organising system is effective, scalable and fault-tolerant, comprising a promising approach to dealing with the suppression of wildfires – one of the world's most pressing challenges of our time.}

The chapter looks at how the priority of decentralized energy is being achieved in Portugal. It explores the current domestic energy market in Portugal, the current remarkable achievements in energy decentralization in terms of policy and legislation, as well as unique obstacles that have become apparent. It assesses new technologies and novel projects introduced to incentivize or further develop such technologies, namely, smart metering systems, electric mobility, demand response, and electricity storage technologies. The chapter also looks at data protection concerns, the interconnection between the electricity markets of Portugal and Spain, and the possibility of a place in the market for the new clean energy sources.

The control scheme is designed for implementation in a modular controller architecture, where a collection of subcontrollers is employed, with each subcontroller being associated with a subsystem that represents a component of the vibrating structure. Each subcontroller uses state feedback from adjacent subsystem sensors to perform vibration suppression and energy harvesting using a switching control law. Furthermore, the assumption is made that neighbouring subcontrollers exchange information collaboratively to estimate the effects of coupling forces, achieving control efficiency comparable to that of a centralized approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a modular suspension platform equipped with semi-active dampers and electromagnetic energy harvesters. The approach is evaluated under various free vibration scenarios, encompassing faulty measurement conditions, and is compared to passive and heuristic state-feedback control strategies. The results confirm that the proposed method attains a superior control performance, independent of the degree of decentralization in the adopted controller architecture, rendering it a viable solution for addressing large-scale semi-active control problems.}

This study thus calculates the green poverty reduction index based on panel data of Chinese prefecture-level cities and constructs a panel fixed-effects model and a spatial Durbin model to empirically test the effects of fiscal decentralization and dual environmental regulations on green poverty reduction. We found that fiscal decentralization significantly inhibits green poverty reduction. Further, formal environmental regulation has a significant positive moderating effect on the above relationship, while informal environmental regulation has a weak negative moderating effect. Heterogeneity analysis showed that formal environmental regulation can significantly contribute to the green poverty reduction effectiveness of fiscal decentralization in the east-central region and in non-contiguous poverty-stricken areas, while informal environmental regulation can strengthen the disincentive effectiveness of fiscal decentralization in non-contiguous poverty-stricken areas. The results provide empirical evidence and policy insights on how to effectively optimize the fiscal decentralization structure and adjust the strength of environmental regulations to promote green poverty reduction efforts.}

The recent paradigm shift in VANETs protocols has led to the adoption of name data networking (NDN) as an underlying communication protocol in VANETs that replaces traditional address-based communication philosophy, treats content as a first-class citizen, and assigns unique names to contents consequently enabling name-based routing and forwarding, caching, and security. Although NDN has significantly improved the underlying communication issues in VANETs, a plethora of challenges such as message broadcast storms, in-efficient packet suppression mechanisms, intermittent connectivity owing to frequent topological changes, and reverse path partioning (RPP) require further attention from the research community. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes decentralized receiver-based link stability-aware forwarding (DRLSF) protocol. The DRLSF is a beacon-less receiver-based multi-hop protocol, well-suited for pull-based applications where end users request desired data by sending packets. The comparative performance analysis validates the effectiveness of the DRLSF protocol in different VANET environments and application scenarios.}

Together with ubiquitous digitalisation, this decentralisation and flexibility at the demand side paves the way towards local energy communities and in its most distributed version to peer-to-peer energy trading, where customers buy and sell electricity among each other. Although peer-to-peer energy trading is not yet legal everywhere, citizen energy communities have been introduced as cornerstones of the energy transition by the European Commission in their Clean Energy for All Europeans programme. This paper firstly discusses this digitalisation and decentralisation of the power infrastructure. These trends are supported by distributed information technologies, including peer-to-peer control paradigms. Distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchains, might be one such piece of the puzzle. The second part of the paper investigates whether blockchain technologies, and their associated smart contracts, offer advantages for larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications over a classic, centralised approach. Different blockchain implementations are investigated and qualitatively evaluated from a scalability, efficiency and trust perspective. The conclusion indicates that in the current state of the art, a trade-off between decentralised and more classical (hierarchically centralised) solutions suits larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications best.}

Globally, these services are undergoing major transformative processes such as digitalization, decentralization, or integrated management. Such processes not only depend on technical changes in infrastructure systems but also include important social and socio-technical dimensions. In this article, we propose a socio-technical network perspective to study the ensemble of social actors and technical elements involved in an infrastructure system, and their complex relations. We conceptualize structurally explicit socio-technical networks of networked infrastructure systems based on methodological considerations from network analysis and draw on concepts from socio-technical system theories and social-ecological network studies. Based on these considerations, we suggest analytical methods to study basic network concepts such as density, reciprocity, and centrality in a socio-technical network. We illustrate socio-technical motifs, i.e., meaningful sub-structures in socio-technical networks of infrastructure management. Drawing on these, we describe how infrastructure systems can be analyzed in terms of digitalization, decentralization, and integrated management from a socio-technical network perspective. Using the example of urban wastewater systems, we illustrate an empirical application of our approach. The results of an empirical case study in Switzerland demonstrate the potential of socio-technical networks to promote a deeper understanding of complex socio-technical relations in networked infrastructure systems. We contend that such a deeper understanding could improve management practices of infrastructure systems and is becoming even more important for enabling future data-driven, decentralized, and more integrated infrastructure management.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has brought forth new challenges to the power grid. Further, the simultaneous charging of EVs could lead to peak demand, potentially causing overloading, voltage swings, and other grid-related problems. To address these issues and lower the high energy costs faced by EV owners and grid operators, EV charging must be optimized. The study proposes an innovative strategy that utilizes decentralized charging systems to lessen the impact of EVs on the grid. A decentralized EV scheduling strategy offers scalability. Thus, making it suitable for a large EV population and it remains resilient to the dynamic arrivals of the EVs. The approach aims to balance the load on the grid and improve the effectiveness of charging operations. To achieve this, a convex optimization problem has been developed to effectively regulate the charging procedure, taking into account the distinct attributes of each EV. The mechanism operates by dividing time into several intervals. Each electric vehicle in the system autonomously adjusts its charging rate during the assigned time slots, with the goal of minimizing individual charging expenses. Moreover, the system demonstrates flexibility in deciding when to charge and discharge, allowing prioritization based on individual EV battery levels and power grid conditions. As a result, the cost analysis was conducted using the number of EVs and the average group size. A comparison of computational times between centralized and decentralized systems was undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the system.}

Our case study is the economic performance of Northern and Southern Italy in the post-World War II period, when a long phase of regional convergence came to a sudden halt in the early 1970s. We focus on the economic effects of the 1970s institutional reforms on government decentralization and wage bargaining. Our main hypothesis is that decentralization allocates the provision of public capital to institutions, the local ones, more exposed to a territory's social capital. Since social capital is lower in the Southern regions, decentralization made their developmental policies less effective from 1970 onwards, and regional inequality increased. We build an endogenous growth model augmented to include the interaction between social capital and public investment as well as the reform of the Italian labour market. We calibrate our model using data of the Italian regions for 1951–71. Our quantitative results indicate that decentralization triggered the influence of local social capital on growth and played a central role in halting the convergence path of the low-social-capital regions.}

abstract = {With the widespread application of distributed power generation, traditional energy consumers are becoming active prosumers. Giving full play to the role of the electricity market in resource allocation, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading between multiple prosumers and consumers helps increase the revenue of electricity sales and reduce the cost of electricity consumption. The participation of flexible resources in P2P energy trading achieves local power complementarity, improves benefits, and reduces the operating pressure of lines. To ensure the benefits of prosumers and stimulate their enthusiasm, it is necessary to propose an effective trading strategy to fully allow flexible resources to participate in P2P energy trading. Therefore, this paper establishes a P2P energy market based on the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) theory, we propose a minimum cost rolling optimization model to optimize the bidding quantity of flexible resources. Moreover, the Automatic Learning (AL) pricing strategy with privacy and learning is proposed. The AL bidding price strategy enables interactive learning among prosumers. In addition, the influence of bidding price on bidding quantity during the trading process is also considered. Furthermore, this paper considers the impact of renewable energy source (RES) uncertainty on the bidding decisions of prosumers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by the simulation results of cases. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the benefits for prosumers, enhance the local balance ability, achieve price learning, and increase the transaction rate.}

However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.}

abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.}

With the rapid development of the mobile Internet of Things, the fastest way for users to access the evaluation system is through mobile devices. However, this also poses security challenges to the traditional professional title evaluation system. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized and security-enhanced digital title evaluation system in mobile IoT. Since the system uses blockchain to implement a decentralized review process, the transparency and fairness of the review process are guaranteed. At the same time, the review data and reviewer information in the system are encrypted and stored in the distributed network to ensure the security and non-tamperability of the data. All review records are recorded on the blockchain, and anyone can view and verify the legitimacy of the review results. Additionally, the system incorporates security enhancement mechanisms such as identity verification, smart contracts, and auditing functions to improve the credibility of the evaluation process and prevent cheating under mobile IoT. Experiments have shown that this system has important application value in the field of professional title review in universities, which can improve review efficiency, reduce human intervention, and provide strong support for the credibility of review results.}

This trend urges energy industries toward the deployment of disparate energy sources with considerable emphasis on renewables with decentralized nature. In such circumstances, future power systems will be faced with a great complexity, dimensionality, uncertainties, and curse of big data. Challenges in this environment have been the basis and motivation for this chapter and other chapters of the book. Traditional decision-making in power systems is done with a centralized approach, as this approach has faced many problems with the complexity of the network and the penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in present power industries. In such an environment, the utilization of decentralized decision-making (DDM) in future power systems to tackle far more sophisticated issues and problems will be an attractive and a relevant framework. In this chapter, first, a brief overview of energy trend in future is addressed and then in the remaining parts of the chapter, the DDM approach and its applications in future power systems are discussed. One of the issues that become more important with the expansion of DERs is the increase in information and the complexity of the network. Information security is another challenge in future power systems whereby entities are reluctant to share their information with users and as a result the decision-making process will face a high degree of complexity. Increased data in the system is another challenge for future power systems. Extracting and analyzing the required information is a time-consuming and complex process. All of these issues complicate future power systems, which necessitates addressing the concept of decentralized frameworks for future power systems. This chapter and particularly the book provide a comprehensive breakdown of the future power system contexts including applications of DDM approach in future power systems.}

The aim of this paper is to discuss specifics of various dimensions of the centralization and decentralization in the rural educational landscape of post-socialist countries using the example of Czechia. Based on the concept of landscape structures, we recommend the categorization of educational landscape processes into three groups: 1) the centralization of educational function, 2) the centralization of curriculum development, and 3) the centralization of educational governance and organization. The research was based on the spatial analysis of main school characteristics and the research results were interpreted within the context of main principles of organization of the elementary education system as identified in educational sciences or as declared in policy and strategic documents. While school concentration and the closures of small schools in rural areas are still widely discussed issues in many countries, in Czechia this dimension of centralization was basically completed in the 1970s. Centralization, which affected primarily rural schools, stood for ideal power control over the organization of curriculum and over school governance in the period of state socialism. After 1989, reflecting the country's overall democratization, the previous method of educational organization was rejected and replaced with highly decentralized approaches to curriculum and the governance of schools. Not the state but municipality authorities became primarily responsible for operating schools. At the same time, schools entered an educational market competing for pupils, which was again disadvantageous for rural schools.}

For this review, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania were chosen as case study nations, and study sites implementing decentralization. We used Google Scholar to find about 280 pieces of peer-reviewed scientific literature. Further, we used the Foucault's approach and the Policy analytical approach (PAA) to distill our review. Finally, we applied assessment indicators: forest conditions, species composition, forest cover, income level, food security status, wealth equality, and equity. Our review of the forest decentralization reforms process based on empowerment and accountability yields the following results: (1) intended to increase efficiency and ecological services are not being implemented properly, (2) forest policy reforms resulted in a net loss of forest area in East Africa, (3) forest status of some forests is stable, and the current decentralization reforms, with the exception of the Duru-Haitemba community-based forest management (Tanzania), do not address the sustainability of the forests. Understandings of the current institutional frameworks and power configurations are insufficient to devolve resources and rights to lower levels of government. This necessitates the development of new viable forest governance systems capable of deviating significantly from established modes of government. Our review suggests that decentralization forest governance and sustainable agricultural resources utilization rely on multilevel institutional architecture, actors’ collaboration at all levels and with regional integration, complement each other to form successful systems within forest landscapes.}

Such missions need onboard planning to avoid communication delays caused by the long distance between the probes and the Earth. However, the traditional centralized planning approaches will burden the manager probe with a high computing load and make the system liable to a single-point failure. A decentralized onboard planning system based on privacy-preserving multi-agent negotiation is proposed to address this problem. The Privacy-preserving Decentralized Multi-Agent Mission Planning Frame (PDMA-MPF) is designed, in which the concepts of private agent and public agent are proposed for the first time. Based on the planning frame, the Decentralized Multi-Agent Iterative Negotiation Task Allocation Method (DMAIN) is developed to allocate tasks and generate local plans for probes. The method uses a deferred-acceptance negotiation pattern, considering the mission profit and load balancing of probes. An information consistency mechanism is designed for the public data synchronization of planners. The local planning of probes is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem with profit optimization. A temporal constraint handling algorithm and a Resource Rate Timeline (RRTL) based resource constraint handling algorithm are proposed to satisfy constraints in a profit optimized way. The planning system verification shows that the proposed system can generate reasonable plans and guarantee public data consistency between planners. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed planning system gets higher mission profits and a more balanced workload of probes, as compared with the traditional Hierarchical Greedy Algorithm.}

To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.}

Although this aggregated picture appears unfavourable, several diverse initiatives promoting the development and application of decentralised renewable energy technologies are in place across the country. The aim of this study is to characterise those initiatives promoting decentralised renewable energy and to assess their potential role in inducing the wider transformation of the Argentinian energy system. To achieve this, we apply conceptualisations for the development of sociotechnical niches and use qualitative research techniques to characterise the sociotechnical dynamics of the decentralised renewable energy sector in Argentina. A niche in an advanced stage of development, in which lessons are systematically aggregated in networks, was identified and examples of generic lessons being used to frame new projects or programmes were also found. In addition to considering the internal niche development processes, we investigate how external factors affect the development of the niche. Finally, we suggest two possible development pathways by which the niche might exert stronger influence on the broader sustainability transformation of the Argentinian power system.}

As energy sources shift and technology evolves, electricity governance is shifting from largely centralized models to include multiple decentralised and multi-level sites not bounded in their operations by established democratic processes. New forms of accountability are required to ensure that multi-level electricity systems meet societal needs and expectations. While multi-level governance dynamics are new for many electricity systems, they are common across other resources (e.g. water). This article uses an OECD framework that synthesizes decades of research on multi-level natural resource governance to describe 12 principles for “good” resource governance. These principles are developed and applied to decentralising electricity governance contexts in order to develop mechanisms, and identify potential governance gaps, that are relevant for ensuring accountability in decentralised electricity governance systems. The nature of decentralised electricity systems particularly highlights the need to rescale many governance functions, while paying attention to issues of inclusion, capacity building, coherence, adaptiveness, and transparency.}

The sector, while providing valuable employment in rural areas, is beleaguered by environmental and social issues. Proponents of decentralisation argue that re-distributing decision-making authority leads to more responsive, transparent and efficient natural resource management. The analysis presented here, however, demonstrates how weak decentralisation has exacerbated the complex, conflictual and clandestine nature of local resource politics surrounding ASM. If future decentralisation reforms are going to reverse this trend and improve the governance of ASM in Ghana, then facilitating the participation of traditional authorities is imperative. It is argued that doing so requires addressing the reticence regarding the role of chiefs in resource governance; simply ironing out existing technical issues with decentralisation reforms is unlikely to improve the social and environmental performance of ASM in the country. In light of the chronic resource management deficiencies in Ghana, epitomised in the ASM sector, fostering frank political debates on resource governance is becoming urgent.}

Using a simple model, we show that the number of miners could be negatively (positively) related to the expected rewards if miners with low-operating costs also have less (more) severe financing constraints. We characterize the possibility of miners with low-operating (high-operating) costs facing less (more) severe financing constraints as large-size (small-size) miners. The empirical evidence supports the model's large- and small-size miner characterization prediction. The negative association between the number of miners and expected rewards is attributable to Bitcoin's exchange rate. Collectively, our evidence suggests that even though the Bitcoin system is designed as an egalitarian system, it is likely to evolve into a near-centralized system because of economic forces.}

This trend raises concerns about fairness and market manipulation by these operators acting as gatekeepers. These concerns have recently been outlined in the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). In this work, we highlight how technological logic of separation understood in the framework of decentralization can address manipulation concerns. As a first step, we devise a reference model of electronic marketplaces, containing six functional components, and outline how control over these components enables different manipulative practices by gatekeepers. We identify two dimensions of decentralization that can counterbalance monopolistic abuse of marketplace components. We then present a software implementation of our reference model and demonstrate how decentralization and unbundling of market components can alleviate manipulation and fairness concerns. We end our work with a review of related approaches and conclude that modular and interoperable marketplaces can enable an open ecosystem of fair electronic markets envisioned by the DMA.}

This study suggests that PPGISs should be developed as decentralized applications (DApp) based on Ethereum blockchain technology to have a fully open, transparent, and accountable environment for public participation. In a blockchain-based PPGIS, the collected data are securely saved on the blockchain. The validity of the data, replicated on the nodes of the peer-to-peer blockchain network, is ensured through a consensus process without any central control. The data is tamper-free and immutable. Additionally, the data is openly accessible to institutions and citizens. A prototype PPGIS was developed as a DApp through which users can participate in the site selection of urban facilities. Using the application, they compare and rank different criteria. The system solves an analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weights of the criteria. A suitability map is generated afterward and published to be used by both citizens and decision-makers. The feasibility of the application, along with the issues that need to be considered while using blockchain technology for urban planning and development, are thoroughly discussed.}

The purpose of this paper is to make policy recommendations for the current fiscal decentralization discussion by examining the operating mechanisms of local taxes, unconditional grants, and conditional grants within the fiscal relationships between the national government and local governments in Korea.
Design/methodology/approach
After examining the current fiscal relationships between the national government and the local governments, this paper analyzes trends of local taxes, unconditional grants from both national and high-level local governments, and conditional grants from both national and high-level (or provincial level) local governments between 2002 and 2015. Local governments are classified into high-level local governments, and three types of low-level local governments are: si, kun, and ku.
Findings
Since the structure of local government finances in Korea is very complicatedly intertwined, the present decentralization discussion regarding increasing the share of local tax revenues may not achieve its purpose of fiscal decentralization. The authorities in charge of revenue allocation should be first decentralized at high-level local governments; high-level local governments should then arrange unconditional and conditional grants from high-level local governments to low-level local governments while taking into consideration unconditional and conditional grants from the national government to low-level governments.
Originality/value
The dichotomy between the central government and local municipalities has been utilized in the existing discussion regarding fiscal decentralization in Korea, but this study highlights the important resource allocation roles of high-level local governments.}

abstract = {In large cities with harbors or rivers, ferry services have been an important part of public transport. In practice, many ferry terminals are subject to geographical and environmental conditions, limited space resources of the terminal pool, and restricted navigable waters of ships, which leads to constrained operations and increases the difficulty of docking when multiple ferries enter and depart from the terminal. Because of the distributed, real-time and dynamic characteristics of multi-ferry maneuvering, this paper proposes a decentralized, time-optimal control strategy to coordinate the maneuvering of multiple entering and departing ferries in restricted terminals. It combines nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) with an iterative learning control (ILC) framework. Based on the states and maneuver data of previously successfully performed trajectories, the coupled constraints among multiple ferries are decomposed with support vector machine (SVM). Therefore, it also does not require real-time information exchange during ferry operations and has the merits of low communication demand, as only local information is required in each ferry controller. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Indeed, they should fully reflect the decentralized perspective of the execution environment and consider QoS, scalability and resilience as key objectives. In this context, the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) paradigm, which envisions the creation of new services as an assembly of independent services available within the environment, can greatly help in tackling the challenges of developing future applications. However, in order to be effective, XaaS paradigm requires self-adaptive service assembly solutions able to cope with the unpredictable variability and scalability of the execution environment, the lack of global knowledge, and the QoS requirements of services to be built. We contribute in this direction by designing a fully decentralized and collective self-adaptive service assembly framework whose main features are: (i) self-assembly, i.e., the ability to operate autonomously, (ii) online-learning, i.e., the ability to dynamically learn from experience, (iii) QoS-awareness, i.e., the inclusion of QoS requirements as driving forces for self-assembly, (iv) scalability, i.e., the ability to cope with a large number of services, and (v) resilience, i.e., the ability to maintain the persistence of service delivery when facing unexpected changes (e.g., in the number and/or QoS of services). Simulation experiments show that our solution makes the system able to quickly converge to viable assemblies that improve and maintain over time the social welfare of the system, despite the local perspective of each participating service.}

Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol.

This paper presents a literature review on swarm electrification and related insights from case studies. The study delves into the concept of swarm electrification, placing it within the context of the prevailing trends in the power system sector: decentralization, decarbonization, and digitalization. It examines the role of digital technologies in enhancing swarm electrification and categorizes application areas according to the phases of swarm electrification. Particular attention is given to the technologies underpinning Deep Digitalization, such as distributed ledger technology, notably blockchain, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on machine learning. These technologies play pivotal roles in advancing swarm electrification. The review demonstrates how deep digitalization can facilitate the improvement of swarm electrification and ultimately support the integration of bottom-up initiatives with top-down grid expansion efforts over time.}

In 2001, the government established an arbitrary rule that granted municipalities with a 2002 population >100,000 almost complete autonomy to provide education services (certification). This analysis takes advantage of this rule to evaluate, using difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity methodologies, the effect of municipal autonomy on teacher quality and student outcomes, including achievement and enrollment. The control group is made up of municipalities for which the provision of education was centralized and managed by the departmental authorities. The results indicate that administrative decentralization (being certified) improves both school enrollment and student achievement as well as the quality of teachers, as measured by teachers’ education level and scores on teachers’ entry competency exams. Using a mediation analysis, the paper finds that higher-quality teachers hired by the certified municipalities partially explained the improvement in student achievement. This analysis also shows that “certified” municipalities invest more local resources in education which also contributes to explain to a much lesser extent their superior educational outcomes. Finally, the results suggest that achieving better student outcomes is less related to the amount of resources that decentralized municipalities managed and more associated with the fact that those resources seem to have been better allocated, generating significant efficiency gains. These gains may be the consequence of lower transaction costs of matching local preferences with local educational interventions.}

In this context, this study proposes a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market incorporating Multi-agent System (MAS) which consists different three agents with variable power levels. In the MAS environment, while Agent-1 represents a community which has variable household number according to the case studies, Agent-2 is an independent aggregator who is not included in, and does not influence the transactions of the Agent-1. Finally, Agent-3 is the ENKA Insaat ve Sanayi A.S. which has office buildings equipped with electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and photovoltaic (PV) panels. In the paper, all the agents simultaneously solve their own sub-problems by distributed way according to the received dynamic price signals along with the availability of the responsive demands. Moreover, 132 case studies consisting of low, medium, and large scale with different prosumer penetration are created in order to obtain optimal grouping strategy. The obtained results indicate that the group formation under middle penetrations gives the highest cost reductions, and the total cost reductions of Agent-1 and Agent-3 are 24.9% and 13.14%, respectively, while the total profit of Agent-2 is 4.53$ according to the best solution.}

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

Moreover, drivers and passengers are charged with different services fees by the electric mobility service provider. The emergence of emerging technologies such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can foster trust, boost electric car-pooling business models. Hence, DLT is utilized to store electric car-pooling trips, drivers, and passengers’ information to ensure user privacy and maintain security. Similarly, social practice theories such as Community of Practice (CoP) is progressively considered as a significant structure within societies as it aids the development and sharing of resources across groups. But very little attention has been devoted to examined how CoP can be employed to support the design of decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling. Leveraging CoP and DLT, this paper proposes a decentralized community of practice-based model that enables drivers to publish electric car-pooling services and passengers to be matched to a driver without depending on a trusted third party. A systematic literature review was adopted to collect data and a case study of a decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling was presented. Findings from this study highlights conceptualization of CoP for improving decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling and provide insights on efficient decentralized mechanisms for electric car-pooling. Theoretically, this article identifies the current problems, state-of-the-art of decentralized electric car-pooling.

Electrochemical biosensors have the potential to provide rapid and inexpensive diagnostics while moving clinical testing from centralized labs to point-of-care (POC) applications. Conductive materials functionalized with bioreceptors that remain stable and functional for measurements in real-world conditions are essential for the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors, and carbon-based nanomaterials provide the electrical, chemical, structural, and mechanical features that make them suitable for POC devices. This review details the most recent developments in the use of carbon-based nanostructures, with a focus on one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, two-dimensional graphene, and graphene oxide, their interface with biological receptors, deposition on portable, flexible, and wearable substrates, and integration on low-cost platforms for detection of clinical biomarkers. The large-scale manufacturing and implementation of microneedles as implantable and electronic tattoos as wearable devices for on-skin diagnostics, and lab-on-mouth platforms as well as the interface with mobile technologies and their potential implementation for remote POC monitoring and decentralized healthcare through cloud processing and the internet of things (IoT) are discussed with examples of applications. The review concludes with an overview of the regulatory perspectives and future trends, challenges, and opportunities for commercialization and translation of these technologies from the research lab to practice, as useful diagnostic tools for remote monitoring of patient health conditions.}

DCL has a wide range of applications in various domains, such as smart city and autonomous driving. However, DCL faces significant challenges in ensuring its trustworthiness, as data isolation and privacy issues make DCL systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks that aim to breach system confidentiality, undermine learning reliability or violate data privacy. Therefore, it is crucial to design DCL in a trustworthy manner, with a focus on security, robustness, and privacy. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of existing efforts for designing trustworthy DCL systems from the three key aformentioned aspects: security, robustness, and privacy. We analyze the threats that affect the trustworthiness of DCL across different scenarios and assess specific technical solutions for achieving each aspect of trustworthy DCL (TDCL). Finally, we highlight open challenges and future directions for advancing TDCL research and practice.}

Therefore, they need to be either prevented effectively by proper contract and payment execution or resolved efficiently with enhanced resolution processes regarding cost, duration, effort, and transparency. However, current practices are inadequate for both effectiveness and efficiency since they mainly depend on centralized authority. This paper is designed in two folds; first, a generic blockchain-based online dispute resolution platform is tested with two litigation cases collected in 1999 and 2009 to show the need for a construction-focused system. Then, a new construction-specific framework, Decentralized Construction Enabling Transparent Resolution (DCENTR), is proposed to address the unique nature of construction projects. Ultimately, it is shown that dispute likelihood can be minimized through reliable contract and payment execution, and if occurred, construction disputes can be resolved with higher transparency and dramatic savings in effort, time, and cost.}

abstract = {Objective
The Italian National Healthcare System (NHS) is one of the most decentralised systems since the devolution reform approved in 2001. HTA is spreading as an important tool for decision-making processes both at central and local levels. The aims of this study were to review the state of the health technology assessment (HTA) programmes in Italy – with a focus on regional and central initiatives – and to discuss consequences of a multi-level structure of HTA agencies in highly regionalised healthcare systems.
Methods
Our method combined documentary review with interviews. We reviewed scientific literature about HTA's activities in decentralised systems, legislative and administrative documents from national as well as regional authorities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 key individuals associated with HTA both at the national and regional levels. Data on HTA programmes implemented or under development in nine regions were collected and analysed according to key principles for the improved conduct of health technology assessments for resource allocation decisions.
Results
HTA is in the early stage of development in Italy, although with great heterogeneity across regions. The National Agency for Health Services has certainly contributed to HTA diffusion through supporting and training activities. However, the multi-level structure of HTA in Italy has not yet provided full coordination and harmonisation of practices and outcomes across the country, with a consequent exacerbate inequality of access to services and technologies.
Conclusions
There is probably need to rethink the multi-layer organizational framework of HTA in Italy by leveraging on current knowledge and efficient redistribution of activities across regions. We would advise for different jurisdictions playing different roles while achieving similar health outcomes for their patients, rather than jurisdictions aiming at doing exactly the same things resulting in unequal access to healthcare service provision.}

abstract = {Decentralized (parent-affiliates) business groups encompass independent firms sharing production resources under common administrative or financial control. Due to the complexity of integrated decision-making, business groups often delegate pricing and technology decisions to separated units. With the growing prevalence of transfer technology in multi-plant operations, there arises a demand for modeling frameworks capturing the joint impact of transfer prices and technology on affiliates’ production. In this paper, we propose an operational methodology to integrate transfer prices and technology, as incentive mechanisms driving affiliates’ production decisions. This consists of a single-leader-multi-follower game where a parent firm (the leader) operates in a single-product market and delegates production to profit-maximizing affiliate firms (the followers). In addition to providing data-driven support for integrated decision-making, our framework reveals how managerial structures respond to the growing significance of intangible technology. In this line, based on the parent’s control of the value chain we present two specifications and solution approaches: full delegation and partial delegation. For the former, we provide an exact characterization of the equilibrium solution; whereas for business groups operating under full delegation, we provide tight lower and upper bounds, computable by state-of-the-art optimization solvers. Our empirical tests rely on a customized version of the Orbis data set. Figures show that our methodology not only integrates the substitutability between transfer prices and technology, as well as their dependency on the parent’s control of the value chain, but also gives rise to a flexible computational approach that is applicable to a wide range of decentralized business groups.}

A review of research literature on decentralized intelligence in freight transport serves as the foundation of the analysis. The analysis reveals a scarcity of scientific evidence to suggest a successful introduction of decentralized freight intelligence. Among numerous conceptual findings, the analysis reveals a dearth of research on the clear and present challenges of introducing and adopting decentralized freight concepts in contemporary multi organizational open freight systems. For practitioners this paper provides useful input on future ICT development in the transport field. In particular, due to the lack of guidance on adoption of decentralized freight, a focus on non-networked benefits of information technology is to be recommended. Given the large number of projects, papers and various initiatives related to decentralized freight intelligence, this paper, to the authors’ best knowledge, provides a novel technology adoption perspective on decentralized freight intelligence research.}

While the central body in such organisations faces asymmetry of information concerning the operating costs of the units, it may wish to incentivise them through benchmarking and target setting to operate as efficiently as possible. If a standard Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is used for this purpose, each operating unit could estimate its own efficient targets. However, this decentralised scenario is not necessarily appropriate for a centralised organisation in which a central body wishes to optimise the performance of the system of units as a whole. On the other hand, a top-down imposed set of targets is often not suitable as they would be too demanding for some units and too lax for others. This paper proposes a DEA-based approach for incentivising the units of a hierarchically structured organisation in order to optimise the performance of the units collectively while at the same time the targets are not too demanding for inefficient units. The proposed approach is also extended so that incentive levels for operating units are determined over time, taking into account any changes in their productivity. Accordingly, the central management can strike a balance between not spending too much on incentives on the one hand and encouraging the operating units to reveal their true cost function on the other. We illustrate our approach using data from a set of German savings banks.}

The paper aims to connect these three aspects of smart manufacturing and proposes that through the application of data-driven modeling, CPPS will aid in transforming manufacturing to become more intuitive and automated. In turn, automated manufacturing will pave the way for the decentralization of manufacturing. Layering blockchain technologies on top of CPPS will ensure the reliability and security of data sharing and integration across decentralized systems. Each of these claims is supported by relevant case studies recently published in the literature and from the industry; a brief on existing challenges and the way forward is also provided.}

This paper proposes a computational framework leveraging dynamic multi-agent networks to conceptualize, model, and quantify multi-agent, decentralized recovery process building upon strategic network formation methods. This innovative approach addresses limitations in conventional strategic network formation models by accounting for the fluidity of structural shifts induced by the strategic behaviors of individual agents, and by acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity within agent populations. The central objective of this study is to highlight the critical role of bottom-up recovery and present a systematic, adaptable framework for modeling these processes in diverse real-world scenarios. We achieve this through four key elements: modeling post-disruption responses, exploring their interdependencies, accommodating multiple equilibria, and generating metrics for scenario comparison and forecasting. Our dynamic strategic network formation model offers valuable insights into crucial trade-offs in decentralized recovery processes and facilitates the integration of both bottom-up and top-down resilience strategies. Furthermore, it could serve as a predictive tool informing initial network architectural decisions by estimating likely post-disruption equilibrium states based on the initial network structure. Ultimately, this study provides a robust platform for analyzing network efficiency and resilience trade-offs, setting the stage for more informed decision-making in complex sociotechnical systems.}

The impact of these ongoing trends on the future energy system, however, is far from straightforward. Although there is an increasing shift towards a decentralisation, it is not clear yet how exactly this new decentralised configuration will unfold and materialise. In this article we explore the rationales behind current trends towards a more decentralised electricity system. Given the developments in the electricity system, our study centres on emerging initiatives led by citizens and their values. Theoretically, we first mobilise the notion of socio-technical system as constituted and reproduced by actors, institutions, and technology, operating based on certain shared principles. We use this lens to describe the past and current energy system organisation. Secondly, based on two dimensions of value orientation and steering direction we define four emerging ideal-types socio-technical decentralisation configurations. We examine possible pathways of change, and the institutional, actor and technological preconditions they require, to become predominant forms of decentralisation. We conclude that although all forms of decentralisation may potentially contribute to low carbon objectives, they are likely to co-evolve catering to diverse system needs and the citizen requirements simultaneously.}

In contrast, the current trend of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches to motor control follows a centralized paradigm using a single, holistic controller that has to untangle the whole input information space. This motivates to ask whether decentralization as seen in biological control architectures might also be beneficial for embodied sensori-motor control systems when using DRL. To answer this question, we provide an analysis and comparison of eight control architectures for adaptive locomotion that were derived for a four-legged agent, but with their degree of decentralization varying systematically between the extremes of fully centralized and fully decentralized. Our comparison shows that learning speed is significantly enhanced in distributed architectures—while still reaching the same high performance level of centralized architectures—due to smaller search spaces and local costs providing more focused information for learning. Second, we find an increased robustness of the learning process in the decentralized cases—it is less demanding to hyperparameter selection and less prone to becoming trapped in poor local minima. Finally, when examining generalization to uneven terrains—not used during training—we find best performance for an intermediate architecture that is decentralized, but integrates only local information from both neighboring legs. Together, these findings demonstrate beneficial effects of distributing control into decentralized units and relying on local information. This appears as a promising approach towards more robust DRL and better generalization towards adaptive behavior.}
