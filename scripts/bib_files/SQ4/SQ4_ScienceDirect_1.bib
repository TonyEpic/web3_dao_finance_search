abstract = {Despite the increase in the number of blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), there is no consensus on what constitutes a DAO. This paper provides an in-depth study of DAOs by analyzing their definitions, characteristics, and emerging developments. Existing definitions in the literature hardly recognize common functionalities and intermingle coded DAOs, DAO deployment platforms, and blockchain DAOs. We developed a comprehensive DAO definition by reviewing the literature and empirically analyzing 1,859 DAOs. The findings show that many DAOs were inactive and that a threshold of 20 tokenholders is a tipping point for DAOs to survive over time and maintain sustained levels of activity. Finally, based on an empirical analysis of 9,845 perceived DAOs, we identified the emerging development of off-chain voting. This emerging development challenges the autonomous nature of DAOs. We recommend further research to investigate the effect of governance structures on their long-term sustainability and viability for both on-chain and off-chain DAOs.}

abstract = {Background
We previously reported a reduction in serum levels of d-serine, an endogenous co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, in schizophrenia, supporting the hypofunction hypothesis of NMDA neurotransmission in schizophrenia. In this study, we examined the genetic roles of serine racemase (SRR), an enzyme catalyzing the formation of d-serine from l-serine, and d-amino-acid oxidase (DAO) in the susceptibility to schizophrenia and the regulation of serum d-serine levels.
Methods
We determined the complete cDNA and genomic structures of SRR and performed mutation screening. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SRR and DAO were tested for their association with schizophrenia in both case-control and family-based designs and for correlation with serum levels of d-serine.
Results
Genomic analyses revealed that human brain SRR transcripts consist of four isoforms with one major species, which were derived from alternative use of various 5’ end exons. Genetic association analyses showed no significant association between SRR/DAO and schizophrenia. We replicated the decreased serum d-serine levels in schizophrenia in the sample set, but d-serine levels did not correlate with SRR/DAO genotypes.
Conclusions
The SRR/DAO are not likely to be major genetic determinants in the development of schizophrenia or control of serum d-serine levels.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

Glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase are three first-line endogenous antioxidants. This study explored the associations of these potential biomarkers with mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive function and blood levels of DAO, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were measured in 63 mild cognitive impairment patients and 24 healthy individuals every 6 months for 2 years. Among the patients, DAO and glutathione levels at baseline contributed to the cognitive decline 2 years later. Among the healthy individuals, only glutathione levels were associated with cognitive change. The four biomarkers differed in change directions (upward vs. downward) in the patients and in the healthy individuals. Among patients, glutathione levels were negatively correlated with superoxide dismutase and positively correlated with catalase, and DAO levels were negatively correlated with superoxide dismutase. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the differential associations of NMDAR hypofunction and oxidative stress with cognitive change between the mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy people. Glutathione may be regarded as an aging marker for both mild cognitive impairment and normal aging; and DAO, a biomarker exclusively for mild cognitive impairment.}

Smart contracts consists of computer code that composed set of rules agreed upon by the involved parties. When these predefined conditions or rules are satisfied by the transactions initiated by parties, the smart contract executes itself to complete the transaction. Normally, while performing transactions with agreements involving multiple parties, a third party have to be involve to verify all the information, which makes it complex and time consuming process. Smart contracts simplify this process by eliminating the third party and automating the process, enabling the stakeholders to perform transactions directly with each other. Smart contract itself is replicated among multiple nodes of a blockchain there by giving benefits of immutability, security and permanence. Most smart contracts are written in Solidity programming language due to its simplicity and conciseness. Attackers are attracted by the popularity of Solidity language and its vulnerability possibilities. For example, in the 2016 year, 60 million US dollars was theft by Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack due to vulnerabilities present in smart contracts. There are few existing tools and papers on this area to find vulnerabilities on smart contracts but taking more time to predict. Thus, this paper presents different Deep learning techniques with satisfactory results to identify smart contract vulnerabilities which are Re-entrancy, Denial of Service (DOS) and Transaction Origin using binary, multi class and multi label classification techniques.}

abstract = {Background
Migraine is a common neurovascular disorder affected by various levels of neurotransmitters. Low histamine metabolism is also related with pathophysiology of migraine. As diamine oxidase (DAO) gene variants are linked with higher levels of histamine in migraine patients, we investigated the possible relationship of two variants rs2052129 and rs10156191of this gene with migraine risk in North Indian population.
Methods
A case-control study for 250 migraine patients and 250 matched healthy controls was conducted by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
Results
We found statistically significant differences in allelic frequencies of rs2052129 (p = .009, OR = 1.462; 95% CI: 1.098–1.947) and rs10156191 (p = .019, OR = 1.430; 95% CI: 1.060–1.928) variants in DAO gene. For rs1015691, we were able to show statistically significant association at all genotypic, dominant and allelic levels in both MA (for T allele, p = .020; OR = 1.662, 95% CI: 1.083–2.551) as well as in female subgroup (for T allele, p = .025, OR = 1.460; 95% CI: 1.049–2.033). But no such significant association was found in clinical sub grouping of migraine in rs2052129 as p > .05. However in gender analysis, protective effect of T allele in male migraine patients for rs2052129 (OR < 1) was found.
Conclusions
Our findings clearly indicated that a female patient with rs10156191T allele and in MA subgroup showed an increased risk for migraine. Our data also indicated that rs2052129T variant showed a significant role in migraine susceptibility of this population.}

abstract = {Ethereum’s public distributed ledger can issue tokenised voting rights that are tradable on crypto-asset exchanges by potentially anyone. Ethereum thus enables global, unincorporated associations to conduct governance experiments. Such experiments are crucial to Decentralised Finance (DeFi). DeFi is a nascent field of unlicensed, unregulated, and non-custodial financial services that utilise public distributed ledgers and crypto-assets rather than corporate structures and sovereign currencies. The inaugural Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index, launched in August 2021, included nine Ethereum-based projects – non-custodial exchanges as well as lending and derivatives platforms. Each project is governed, at least in part, by unregistered holders of tokenised voting rights (also known as governance tokens). Token-holders typically vote for or against coders’ improvement proposals that pertain to anything from the allocation of treasury funds to a collateral’s risk parameters. DeFi’s governance thus depends on the distribution and exercise of tokenised voting rights. Since archetypal DeFi projects are not managed by companies or public institutions, not much is known about DeFi’s governance. Regulators and law-makers from the United States recently asked if DeFi’s governance entails a new class of “shadowy” elites. In response, we conducted an exploratory multiple-case study that focused on the tokenised voting rights issued by the nine projects from Bloomberg’s inaugural Galaxy DeFi index. Our mixed methods approach drew on Ethereum-based data about the distribution, trading, staking, and delegation of voting rights tokens, as well as project documentation and archival records. We discovered that DeFi projects’ voting rights are highly concentrated, and the exercise of these rights is very low. Our theoretical contribution is a philosophical intervention: minority rule, not “democracy”, is the probable outcome of token-tradable voting rights and a lack of applicable anti-concentration laws. We interpret DeFi’s minority rule as timocratic.}

The techno-economic analysis is often used to develop these promising energy systems, ignoring some performance indicators and environmental factors. This study proposes a multi-approach framework for developing operationally feasible, economically viable, and environmentally sustainable hybrid energy systems in remote areas. A case study is conducted on Con Dao Island in Vietnam to supply its electricity demand using six on-grid and off-grid hybrid energy systems. After finding the best techno-economic configurations of the six developed systems, they are subjected to multi-approach analysis and exhaustive comparison using a set of performance, economic, and environmental indicators. An off-grid hybrid energy system comprising photovoltaics, wind turbines, lead-acid batteries, and diesel generators has the lowest net present cost (109.7 million USD) to supply the predicted island's electricity consumption (with a total on-site electricity generation of 184.1 GWh/yr). However, this off-grid system indicates the highest excess energy fraction (55%), while the on-grid systems with the ability to export excess energy to the grid have no excess energy fraction. In terms of eco-friendliness, an on-grid hybrid energy system consisting of a high level of photovoltaics and wind turbines shows the best results, with a negative total environmental impact and CO2-eq emissions. This on-grid system shows the best cost of energy (0.1 USD/kWh) with approximately 450% less total environmental impact than the best off-grid system investigated, offsetting about 48.2 kilotonnes of CO2-eq/yr by exporting net emission-free electricity. Overall, the proposed framework can assist decision-makers in finding feasible, viable, and sustainable hybrid energy systems.}

Waddington's concepts of ‘chreods’ (canalized paths of development) and ‘homeorhesis’ (the tendency to return to a path), each associated with ‘morphogenetic fields’, were conceived by him as a contribution to complexity theory. Subsequent developments in complexity theory have largely ignored Waddington's work and efforts to advance it. Waddington explained the development of the concept of chreod as the influence on his work of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, notably, the concept of concrescence as a self-causing process. Processes were recognized as having their own dynamics, rather than being explicable through their components or external agents. Whitehead recognized the tendency to think only in terms of such ‘substances’ as a bias of European thought, claiming in his own philosophy ‘to approximate more to some strains of Indian, or Chinese, thought, than to western Asiatic, or European, thought.’ Significantly, the theoretical biologist who comes closest to advancing Waddington's research program, also marginalized, is Mae-Wan Ho. Noting this bias, and embracing Whitehead's and Waddington's efforts to free biology from assumptions dominating Western thought to advance an ontology of creative causal processes, I will show how later developments of complexity theory, most importantly, Goodwin's work on oscillations, temporality and morphology, Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics, Salthe's work on hierarchy theory, biosemiotics inspired by Peirce and von Uexküll, Robert Rosen's work on anticipatory systems, together with category theory and biomathics, can augment while being augmented by Waddington's work, while further advancing Mae-Wan Ho's radical research program with its quest to understand the reality of consciousness.}

A growing body of literature has emerged exploring DAOs. However, there is a considerable lack of clarity about this organizational design and its theoretical conceptualization. To this end, we undertake an integrative literature review that reveals three main principles—decentralized, automated and autonomous organizations—and the following four theoretical perspectives mainly adopted to examine this novel organizational form: transaction cost theory, institutions for collective action, agency theory, and socio-materiality. By extending these theories, we propose an integrative model of DAO for research and theory building.

To resist malicious TPAs, a plethora of blockchain-based public auditing mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot effectively mitigate single point of failure and collusion between TPAs and miners. These schemes are burdened by significant wastage of storage resources due to the presence of redundant data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized auditing scheme supporting ciphertext deduplication (BDACD). BDACD leverages a decentralized blockchain, which takes over the role traditionally played by a centralized TPA. A decentralized autonomous organization is incorporated to enhance resistance against collusion attacks. By integrating advanced ciphertext deduplication techniques, BDACD effectively mitigates storage overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept, T-Merkle hash tree, along with a corresponding search algorithm. This innovation significantly enhances blockchain storage utilization and enables efficient half-interval searches within a block. To ensure accountability and fairness, a smart contract is employed to establish an arbitration mechanism. This mechanism serves a dual purpose: penalizing any malevolent actions by cloud servers and providing adequate compensation to data owners whose data integrity has been compromised. Detailed security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate BDACD has desirable security and efficiency.}

Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field. Using the case of Pixie – the world’s first fully functional decentralised photo and video sharing social network based on blockchain technology, this insight paper identifies a conceptual model of blockchain-enabled social media that is useful for illustrating the successful business strategy and operations of firms. Particularly, the identified model employs four pillars of innovation as fundamental technologies, governance and operations, incentive mechanism design, and organisational structure and performance.

Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.}

We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 DAO members from a variety of sectors to identify how they arrange their voting processes, distribute collaborative decision-making, and maintain their tokens. Three themes emerge from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) voting structure, (2) proposal management, and (3) token management. Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose. However, the operations and methods implemented are more oriented toward agency viewpoints due to their reliance on incentive-based processing and are based on a lack of trust among DAO stakeholders. This study provides empirical insights into DAO governance mechanisms.11Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).}

This is because of the merging of platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp under the “Meta” umbrella, intending to encompass all forms of digital communication and virtual environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this trend, as the need for virtual social interaction has grown due to the cancellation of in-person events. However, creating a metaverse environment parallel to the real world necessitates an examination of its sustainability dimensions, including those from economic, environmental, social, and technological viewpoints. A sustainable metaverse must possess certain characteristics, such as being able to meet high computational demands, being interoperable and scalable, and having appropriate norms and regulations in place. This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of a sustainable metaverse in detail. The Fuzzy Cognitive Map is used to handle negative causal relationships and address the lack of crisp data. Additionally, scenario analysis is conducted to examine the impact of changes in specific characteristics on other characteristics. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the understanding of the metaverse and can serve as a valuable resource for those working to create a sustainable virtual world.}

abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.}

abstract = {Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as a common endocrine disease in reproductive-age women, which is characterized by both reproductive and metabolic disorders. Cang-Fu-Dao-Tan Formula (CFDTF) is an effective and relatively safe treatment for PCOS. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood.
Purpose
To explore the effective compounds and mechanisms of CFDTF in treating PCOS based on UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, network pharmacology and molecular experiments.
Methods
The UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS and TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction databases were used to identify the active ingredients of CFDTF. Then GeneCards, Disgenet, Drugbank databases were used to obtain the PCOS related targets. Based above, the Drug-component-target (D-C-T) network and protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network were built to analysis the key targets. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed to find the potential mechanisms. Finally, molecular docking analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular experiments were used to confirm the interactions among the active compounds, targets and explore the potential mechanisms.
Results
A total of 20 compounds were identified by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, and 136 active compounds by TCMSP from CFDTF. After removing the duplicate results, there were 370 targets related to both CFDTF and PCOS, among which, MAPK3, AKT1, RELA, EGF, TP53 and MYC were proved to have high interactions with the components. The mechanisms of CFDTF against PCOS were related to PI3K-Akt, mTOR, MAPK signaling pathways, and the in vitro experiments proved that the CFDTF positively regulated the cell proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis levels in PCOS cell model.
Conclusions
The combination of UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, systematic network pharmacology and molecular experiments identified that the quercetin, hesperidin, and glycyrrhizin disaccharide are the TOP 3 effective compounds of CFDTF in treating PCOS and the potential mechanisms may involve in regulating proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells.}

To overcome this, rural areas have experimented with decentralised governance. However, this process is fraught with political, fiscal, and institutional difficulties. These often revolve around transparency and accountability issues and low participation rates. Blockchain technology could act as a social innovation to overcome issues in decentralised governance, and rural areas could even prove to be a fertile environment for future innovation. In this conceptual paper, the potential of blockchain technology is theoretically positioned in regional development discourses. After exploring how blockchain could be applied to rural governance and the barriers it needs to overcome to reach mass adoption, a new distributed model of governance is suggested.}

Traditionally, the research databases are assigned electronic identifiers, and manuscripts are preserved in electronic form. Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.}

While the potential benefits of blockchain in education are significant, there are also several challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of this technology in the educational sector. Some of the major challenges include adoption, technical knowledge, interoperability, regulation, cost, data privacy and security, scalability, and accessibility. The necessary equipment for the implementation of blockchain technology in education is diverse and critical to the success of this innovative technology. Organizations should carefully consider this equipment when planning their implementation of blockchain technology in education to ensure the efficient and secure transfer of educational data and transactions within the blockchain network. Blockchain technology has the potential to play a significant role in promoting sustainability education and advancing the sustainability goals of both individuals and organizations. Organizations should consider incorporating blockchain technology into their sustainability education programs, in order to enhance the transparency, verifiability, and efficiency of their sustainability-related activities.

Despite research into autonomic models for managing computer resources, ranging from individual resources (e.g., web servers) to a resource ensemble (e.g., multiple resources within a data centre), research into integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve resource autonomy and performance at scale continues to be a fundamental challenge.

To that end, we investigate the Ethereum-based DeFi security issues: 1) inherited from the real-world financial system, which can be solved by macro-control; 2) induced by the problems of blockchain architecture, which require a better blockchain platform; 3) caused by DeFi invented applications, which should be focused on during the project development.

However, the governance of an OSS producing DAO should match the particularities of OSS production while also overcoming the existing challenges of decentralized governance. The existing decentralized governance frameworks do not include all the governance activities of OSS projects. Therefore, this study presents a governance framework for DAOs that produce OSS. The framework is built upon a total of 34 articles on DAO and OSS governance. The framework was evaluated in three leading DAOs that produce OSS. The evaluation underscores the significance of the framework and proves the potential of the systematic categorization of governance mechanisms. Finally, we list emerging governance practices in various governance domains in this developing field.}

abstract = {Within the last two decades, communication technologies have evolved and continue evolving rapidly, and this caused significant advancements in Internet of Things applications and services. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, have numerous emerging applications in various domains of life and have attracted the interest of researchers because of their fundamental attributes such as mobility, flexibility, reliability, and energy efficiency in wireless networks. Similar to wireless sensor networks and other remote sensing applications, these devices are generally not designed with integrated security mechanisms. Furthermore, the existing solutions in which the main focus is on drone communication security are quite limited in the literature. Blockchain (BC) is defined as a list of data blocks as a publicly distributed ledger, which is linked together using cryptography such as hash functions and public key infrastructures. In this matter, cryptographic security issues have increased. Conventional UAVs mostly depend upon centralized servers, where the authentication mechanisms run. Therefore, in recent years, new, advanced authentication/privacy protection techniques have been designed and developed for the diversity of computer security requirements resulting in the introduction of different kinds of security models. One of these suggestions is to use a decentralized BC-based server to secure information. In order to make precise decisions, machine learning (ML) techniques are required to analyze and decide on secure data in the BC-based server. There are various traditional ML techniques, such as support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory to analyze the attacks on a BC-based network. However, there are a limited number of detailed studies in the literature on ML adoption for making BT-based networks more resilient against attacks. In this paper, various ML algorithm applications based on BC-based cryptographic algorithms for UAVs are discussed in detail, with some future research directions given.}

We then conclude with guidelines for other organizations looking to implement similar blockchain governance solutions while maintaining integrity in their operations.}

In second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum, the ledger is coupled with smart contracts, which enable the automation of transactions associated with agreements between the parties of a financial or commercial nature. The coupling of smart contracts and ledgers provides the technological background for very innovative application areas, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which propelled blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies that were the only focus of first generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin. However, the currently used implementation of smart contracts as arbitrary programming constructs has made them susceptible to dangerous bugs that can be exploited maliciously and has moved their semantics away from that of legal contracts. We propose here to recompose the split and recover the reliability of databases by formalizing a notion of contract modeled as a finite-state automaton with well-defined computational characteristics derived from encoding in terms of allocations of resources to actors, as an alternative to the approach based on programming. To complete the work, we use temporal logic as the basis for an abstract query language that is effectively suited to the historical nature of the information kept in the ledger.}

In this paper we aim to review the existing governance practices of established or popular blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems with a view to understanding how they hold up in times of crises. What questions are raised when they are compromised or faced consensus challenges in coordinating action especially around control and accountability? We use a translational process, generating focal insights about present concerns from the reference point of completed academic studies and extensive practitioner consultation. Rather than adopting a declarative approach attempting to provide all the answers, we draw insights from the IT platform governance literature to offer a critical perspective for asking the right questions around key governance issues in financial infrastructure such as decision rights, control mechanisms, and incentives.}

Our findings reveal that both factors significantly influence the efficiency of crypto-assets. Notably, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) exhibit higher efficiency compared to non-DAO projects. This suggests that transparent decentralized decision-making models can reduce information asymmetry, leading to a more efficient market pricing. Furthermore, we show a positive relationship between market efficiency and increased liquidity and age.

However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platform’s potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.}

In this paper, we present a PoS simulator written in the Julia language that allows one to test several variants of PoS-based consensus algorithms, tweaking their parameters, and observe how the distribution of cryptocurrency coins among the users evolves over time. Such a tool can be used to investigate which combinations of parameters values allow to obtain a “fair” and stable consensus algorithm, in which, over the long term, no one gets richer or poorer by the mere act of validating blocks. Based on this investigation, we also introduce a new PoS-based consensus mechanism that allows the system to keep the wealth distribution stable even after a large number of epochs.}

An annually-banded coral (Porites sp.) collected from Con Dao Island in the southern SCS was measured for Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios at near-monthly resolution through the annual bands of AD 1948–1999. This island is only ~90 km from the Mekong Delta coast and thus significantly influenced by riverine discharge, suggesting relatively severe environmental stress on corals. The Sr/Ca time series shows a clear annual cyclicity chiefly modulated by sea-surface temperature (SST), whereas the Mg/Ca time series exhibits an indistinct annual cyclicity, indicating that the previously-proposed coral Mg/Ca thermometry is greatly disturbed. An instrumental SST record in Con Dao Island (since 1980) has been compared with the Sr/Ca time series to calibrate a Sr/Ca thermometer. The Sr/Ca vs. SST comparison shows that the Sr/Ca thermometer is sometimes disturbed by some factor and that almost all of the disturbances occur around the annual-maximum SST in the warm/wet season. The Sr/Ca data around the annual-minimum SST in the cool/dry season is almost free from the disturbance and thus useful as a SST proxy. The disturbances of the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca thermometers may be ascribed to the Mekong River discharge and its accompanying phenomena (i.e., large freshwater input, suspended-sediment loads, intense phytoplankton blooms, etc.), which are likely to disturb coral physiological processes. Applying the Sr/Ca thermometer to the whole Sr/Ca time series provides a SST reconstruction from 1948 through 1999. Reconstructed annual-minimum SSTs show a clear quasi-biennial oscillation significantly correlated with ENSO, indicating that the annual-minimum SST in the southern SCS tends to be higher (lower) in El Niño (La Niña) phases. This is compatible with previous observations that the East Asian winter monsoon is weakened (strengthened) in El Niño (La Niña) phases. The reconstructed SST record suggests a warming of 1.0 °C for the latter half of the 20th century. The Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca time series exhibit similar decadal-to-bidecadal variations, which do not seem to be primarily due to SST variability but rather due to some other factor possibly related to disturbance or fluctuation of coral physiological processes. Although both of our Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca data are affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by some non-temperature factor, a part of the Sr/Ca data provides a useful SST proxy and suggests that coral-based SST reconstruction in the southern SCS may be an effective means for monitoring the EAM and ENSO.}

The package represents a first attempt to regulate a complex and emerging phenomenon, characterised by significant trade-offs. Unsurprisingly, in this early stage of the law-making process several relevant aspects of the crypto environment remain unaddressed, such as pure DeFI models, DAOs, and NFTs. Such regulatory gap is to a large extent attributable to the difficulty of addressing technologically complex issues through command-and-control top-down legislation. The improvements delivered by the Better Regulation Agenda are not enough to solve this conundrum. In this context, the Communication by the Bank of Italy on Decentralised Technology in Finance and Crypto-assets and its first move, the smart-contract MoU, provide an interesting case study to discuss the potential of ‘participatory regulation.’ This experimental form of regulation tries to get the most out of co-regulation, self-regulation, and command-and-control, combining their characters with the view of reconciling the technology neutrality principle with technology-based regulation. Participatory regulation aims to bridge the public and private sector in order to strike a right balance between flexibility and legal certainty, without stifling innovation.}

abstract = {In the information age, electronic documents (e-documents) have become a popular alternative to paper documents due to their lower costs, higher dissemination rates, and ease of knowledge sharing. However, digital copyright infringements occur frequently due to the ease of copying, which not only infringes on the rights of creators but also weakens their creative enthusiasm. Therefore, it is crucial to establish an e-document sharing system that enforces copyright protection. However, the existing centralized system has outstanding vulnerabilities, and the plagiarism detection algorithm used cannot fully detect the context, semantics, style, and other factors of the text. Digital watermark technology is only used as a means of infringement tracing. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for e-document sharing based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and non-fungible token (NFT) in blockchain. The use of blockchain as a distributed credit base resolves the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional centralized systems. The e-document evaluation and plagiarism detection mechanisms based on the DAO model effectively address challenges in comprehensive text information checks, thereby promoting the enhancement of e-document quality. The mechanism for protecting and circulating e-document copyrights using NFT technology ensures effective safeguarding of users’ e-document copyrights and facilitates e-document sharing. Moreover, recognizing the security issues within the DAO governance mechanism, we introduce an innovative optimization solution. Through experimentation, we validate the enhanced security of the optimized governance mechanism, reducing manipulation risks by up to 51%. Additionally, by utilizing evolutionary game analysis to deduce the equilibrium strategies of the framework, we discovered that adjusting the reward and penalty parameters of the incentive mechanism motivates creators to generate superior quality and unique e-documents, while evaluators are more likely to engage in assessments.}

However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.}

However, by following the Bisq Trade Protocol and interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use novel address clustering heuristics to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We describe address clustering heuristics for both the Bisq Trade Protocol and the Bisq DAO. We show that the heuristics aggregate activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.}

abstract = {This study evaluates the interplay between decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) within the realm of inclusive banking by examining their foundational components, namely, alternative finance industry, distributed ledger platforms, and future payment technologies. The alternative finance industry leverages innovative technologies, such as direct lending, crowdfunding, automated wealth management, on-demand insurance, and digital currencies. This feature aligns well with the DeFi principles, and it is also beneficial to CeFi. Distributed ledger platforms offer transparency and security for both DeFi and CeFi, whereas future payment technologies provide user-friendly solutions. This study applies novel wavelet and quantile cross-spectral coherence analyses to obtain nuanced relationship insights. This methodology categorizes crypto finance into the DeFi and broader cryptocurrency ecosystems to facilitate robust comparison with traditional banking. It further delineates democratized banking into alternative financing mechanisms, distributed ledger technologies, and future payment capabilities. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals time–frequency associations, whereas quantile cross-spectral coherence unveils extreme connections under different market conditions. The findings suggest the existence of dynamic relationships between inclusive banking components and various financial infrastructures. These relationships vary across return distributions and time scales. In regular markets, positive associations are seen in yearly and monthly frequency cycles with alternative finance and centralized services exhibiting the strongest linkage. During periods of extremely high returns, CeFi and centralized-decentralized (hybrid) infrastructures exhibit limited interconnectivity with democratized banking. Moreover, DeFi's association with distributed ledger technology is negligible. In bear markets, the strongest positive associations are observed between inclusive access and conventional, hybrid, and decentralized financial systems.

abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.}

If it brings along opportunities for entrepreneurs, there is no such thing as a theory of blockchain ventures yet. Blockchain technology drives the emergence of unprecedented types of ventures, with varying degrees of decentralization, both from an infrastructural and organizational perspective. However, there is no consistency regarding the definitions and labels used to refer to blockchain ventures. This paper proposes a definition of blockchain ventures and provides a typology distinguishing four ideal types of blockchain ventures. Our findings reveal that blockchain ventures do not inherently entail either organizational or infrastructural decentralization. They contribute to a better understanding of the diverse nature of blockchain ventures and their implications.}

A public process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private, internal business process, thus allowing a provider to reveal only relevant, non-confidential parts of its business process to its clients. Providers can change their internal business processes that may result in inconsistencies with the corresponding process views. Objective: This paper aims to develop an approach for propagating changes from an internal, private process to its public process view, such that the internal process and its process view remain consistent. Method: We develop the approach in a formal way. Definitions of process models and process views are based on BPEL, the standard language for realizing process models using state-of-the-art service-oriented technology. We validate the feasibility of the approach by showing how it can be supported by a conceptual system architecture. Results: The approach relies on two key results. First, a formal characterization of the set of private changes to an internal process, i.e., changes that do not need to be propagated to the process view. Second, a characterization of the non-private changes that can safely be propagated from an internal process to its process view such that they remain consistent. Other non-private changes result in an internal process and a process view that are not consistent. The approach is supported by a system architecture for process-based business collaboration. Conclusion: The approach supports providers in deciding if and how changes to a private, internal process propagate to its public process view such that the process view and the internal process remain consistent. The approach allows clients to monitor a public process view such that they can safely track changes made to a private, internal process.}

Hand tools were developed with the invention of the wheel, followed by animal-powered vehicles, and then steam engine technology. After the advancement of electromechanical technologies, today's modern vehicles have been developed. Those who used these vehicles thought of transferring control from the human to autonomous driving systems to solve their safety and comfort problems. Today, instead of fully autonomous systems targeted for the future, autonomous driving support systems have been developed. Although these systems aim to increase the safety and comfort of passengers, they can become an easy target for malicious people due to network technologies and remote connection features. The most effective method of protection from these attackers is to conduct vulnerability analysis against newly emerging threats for the systems we use and to rectify identified vulnerabilities. In this research paper, the weaknesses of wireless communication towards remote connection usage of the mini electric autonomous vehicle were investigated, which we developed and produced its mechanics, electronics, and software. In this context, a test environment was created, and the problems and threats in autonomous driving technology were revealed through attacks (Deauth Attack, DoS, DDoS and MitM) made on the test environment. Following the exposed vulnerabilities, studies were conducted for the detection of these attacks using Artificial Intelligence. In the study, different algorithms were used to detect the attacks, and random forest algorithm successfully detected 96.1% of attacks.

These issues have become critically important for economic governance in the context of climate change. Ronald Coase has proposed the most efficient market-based approach to the problem of social costs. This approach has introduced the concept of limited right to perform activities harmful to the third party and provided basis for a peer-to-peer (P2P) settlement of reciprocal damage. Decentralized P2P approach is necessary for evaluation of negative impact costs and mitigation benefits. Advance of decentralized arbitration technologies, such as Blockchain, crucially decreases transaction costs for P2P interactions and thus provides for further development of Coase paradigm. Application of Blockchain technology to mitigat collateral socio-environmental damage of economic activities relies on a concept of decentralized P2P and public evaluation of negative impact, distribution of liability, and settlement in the form of mitigation. Decentralized autonomous organization integral platform for climate initiatives (DAO IPCI) is designed to be truly decentralized public Blockchain-ecosystem and aims at creation of common business space to attract financing from investors not limited by financial capacity, location, or legal status with minimization of transaction costs, increased reliability and transparency of the whole process, which would be free of interference, interventions, manipulations, or falsifications. Although the initial objective is to provide existing markets with a “Blockchain option” or “Blockchain representation,” the goal is also to create a way for environmental markets to evolve toward truly decentralized and free personal market choice model.}

More specifically, these concepts are discussed in relation to three partially distinct philosophical frameworks: Confucianism, Marxism, and economic pragmatism. Our analysis in this paper draws on studies in comparative education and Chinese studies as well as policy reports released by the Central Government. Based on the analysis, the paper suggests taking a cultural approach to studying engineering education policy, with important implications for both Chinese and Western scholars and policymakers.

This paper delves into the analysis of a Bitcoin price and volume dataset, spanning from September 2014 to July 2023. The objective is to extract multiple features related to price volatility and employ them to forecast the Bitcoin price for the subsequent 7 days. To achieve this, an Ensemble Learning Method (ELM) is proposed, able to estimate prices in both bullish and bearish markets. For price prediction, we consider three categories of predictors: 1) Bitcoin historical data; 2) volatility indicators; 3) trend prediction (price up or down) obtained through binary classification. Further, we employ a combination of ensemble models (regressors and classifiers) to predict the price at the daily level. The predictions of these models are stacked and weighted by the proposed ELM to improve the forecast accuracy. The ELM is rigorously tested under various market scenarios, yielding results that demonstrate a noteworthy level of forecast accuracy. The period of 2021 stands out as particularly interesting for prediction due to several dramatic price swings. The ELM achieves a substantial 26% improvement in overall accuracy compared to the best-performing individual ensemble model. Throughout the entire year-2021, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) stood at 319 USD, indicating a notably low MAE.}

It proposes a blockchain-based architecture that uses smart contracts to implement various algorithmic versions of the Income Sharing principle among companies participating in a supply chain. The formation of the total income and its consequent redistribution are calculated taking into account the role of the technological platform automating these procedures, which therefore becomes a party to the inter-company business project of a supply chain in the alternative roles, as feasible in business practice, of Blockchain-as-a-Service and Blockchain-as-a-Partner.

abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.}

abstract = {Blockchain has become one of the great drivers of technological evolution of nowadays, making industries interested in the possible applications of that technology. One of the sectors that can benefit from this technology is the online betting industry. According to Statista, the total value of transactions carried out in this industry will be 92.9 billion dollars in 2023. Therefore, the need to make transactions more transparent is undoubtedly one of the main requirements of the betting industry, which promotes continuous technological development in the search for ideal solutions. This “technology” allows the creation of records that cannot be falsified. The applicability of this technology in the betting industry can be very attractive in terms of ensuring greater transparency in transactions. Furthermore, in order to decentralize the organization, it is also intended to implement a DAO governance model. This model aims to solve a centralized governance problem and, therefore, consists of governance based on the code and not on a single person/entity. In the scope of this paper, it was possible to demonstrate through a proof-of-concept solution, the applicability of Blockchain and the DAO governance model in a bookmaker. Thie solution was designed and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, using smart contracts. The results obtained in the comparison study showed that the solution is viable and presents advantages compared to traditional solutions.}

DAO envisages a decentralised democratic organisation using software-based smart contracts to execute autonomous transactions with consensus among stakeholders. The study investigates the prospects of adopting DAO led corporate governance to manage agency (theory) problems in the light of institutional (theory) pressures. The paper depicts how algorithmic trust led corporate governance measures help any organisation follow policies, rules and regulations using DAO led corporate governance (DAOCG) framework. The authors mapped the constituents of agency theory, ethical decision-making, and institutional factors to propose the DAOCG framework. The DAOCG framework is assessed using a thematic analysis of 16 expert interviews with relevant experience from corporate governance and audit domains from varied industries across geographies. The research leveraged MAXQDA software to analyse interview transcripts and opinion codes. The framework helps to identify the core elements of DAO-led corporate governance (DAOCG) and provides the potential to study the theoretically sequenced practical constituents of corporate governance. The first-of-its-kind practical DAOCG framework can be used in the pursuits of digital transformation, business model innovation and social change.}

This article examines the impact of disruptive technologies on e-diasporas in the context of data extractivism, particularly stemming from HD. The article pursues a dual objective: (i) reviewing existing literature and comparing five disruptive technologies—Blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Data Cooperatives, Metaverse, and ChatGPT—in sustaining e-diasporas as networks driven by human agency, and (ii) scrutinizing associated opportunities and risks, including challenges to institutional trust and data privacy arising from HD. The study seeks to elucidate how these technologies may either hinder or exacerbate the impacts of HD on e-diasporas, characterized by their human-driven nature. The article begins with an introduction to HD, followed by a literature review on e-diasporas. Methodologically, it presents a comparative analysis of the five disruptive technologies concerning the research question and discusses their implications for e-diasporic communities, concluding with final remarks.}

Steemit is recognized as one of the earliest blockchain-based online communities, and a typical example of DAO. By endowing community members with new roles, the decentralization of blockchain-based communities brings changes to the design of user incentive mechanisms. However, few studies have paid attention to the user incentive mechanism when users play the dual roles of social participant and community owner. On the basis of social capital theory and psychological ownership theory, this study explores Steemit's incentive mechanism by evaluating the impact of these dual roles on user active participation behavior. The study adopts a two-way fixed effect negative binomial regression to test the research model. The results show that users’ social capital, share capital, social feedback, and economic feedback positively affect their active participation behavior. At the same time, social feedback and economic feedback play moderating roles on the effects of the dual capitals. Overall, this research provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for understanding, designing, and governing blockchain-based online communities.}

In this chapter we discuss the needs for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) and key efforts in this field. We then introduce a prospective solution employing blockchain Ethereum, which incorporates a Turing complete programming language with smart contract computing functionality. A solution is elaborated that permits the formation of organizations where participants preserve straight real-time check of contributed collects and governance policies are formalized, automatized and imposed using software. Basic code for smart contract is composed to make a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain. We also explain the working of DAOs code, centering on fundamental establishment and governance characteristics, which includes organization, formation and voting rights. DAOs are considered to agree to the expectation of the business work in the future. But there is still lack of operational base for DAOs in the blockchain community.}

Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.}

A thematic systematic literature review is conducted to understand the literature on this topic, employing the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis) technique. An examination of 155 papers shows that using BC technology (BCT) replaces the cognitive attribution of trust in the material and human-independent code. It is also found that further research anchored to the ‘trust’ concept is required in building BC governance structures. To provide the direction in which the literature is travelling, future research questions on trust and governance are documented. In general, the literature review suggests that BC has the potential to revolutionize the way in which businesses operate. By improving transparency, efficiency, and security, BC can help businesses to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and make better decisions. This research can help policymakers, industrialists, and researchers to identify where BC governance is being used and which aspects of governance are to be focused on. This paper is a general review of literature and evidence on contemporary developmental issues.}

abstract = {Background
Gender and sexual diversity (GSD) individuals are at increased risk of negative health outcomes and suffer health inequities and discrimination. Many GSD individuals do not seek healthcare for fear of being discriminated against and do not disclose this part of their identity to their health care providers, leading to diagnostic or prescription errors. The objective of our study is to improve understanding of the primary health care needs of GSD individuals.
Methods
This qualitative study relied on semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of GSD individuals recruited through community associations and medical offices in Geneva. Interviews were based on the critical incident technique. Thematic analysis of interview content involved all researchers. GSD community members informed the content of the interview guide, the recruitment process and the results validation.
Findings
Interviews took place with 19 GSD individuals, of whom 7 identified as cisgender, 8 as transgender, 5 as non-binary, 1 as intersex and 3 as in questioning (4 stated double identification). They self-categorized as being gay (4), lesbian (5), bisexual (1), pansexual (4), queer (2), queer bisexual (1), lesbian non binary (1) and in questioning (1). Their age ranged from 25 to 56 years (mean 36.31). The main primary care consultation challenges for GSD patients were: revelation of GSD status, feeling categorized, marginalized or discriminated against, and dealing with physician embarrassment or lack of competence regarding the GSD health issues. These challenges impacted negatively medical treatment and health prevention. To overcome these challenges they proposed measures to improve physicians’ knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding GSD patients, and structural measures for GSD-friendly medical offices.
Discussion
Exploring health experiences of GSD patients in primary care identified that the key issues impacting their health care are related to doctor-patient communication. They provide practical, individual and structural solutions for secure and inclusive health care.}

To understand the state-of-the-art of blockchain governance, we conducted a systematic literature review with 37 primary studies. The extracted data from primary studies are synthesised to answer identified research questions. The study results reveal several major findings: (1) governance can improve the adaptability and upgradability of blockchain, whilst the current studies neglect broader ethical responsibilities as the objectives of blockchain governance; (2) governance is along with the development process of a blockchain platform, while ecosystem-level governance process is missing, and; (3) the responsibilities and capabilities of blockchain stakeholders are briefly discussed, whilst the decision rights, accountability, and incentives of blockchain stakeholders are still under studied. We provide actionable guidelines for academia and practitioners to use throughout the lifecycle of blockchain, and discuss future trends to support researchers in this area.}

So far, few studies have been conducted on outdoor thermal comfort in hot-summer and cold–winter area of southern China. The Dao He Old Block locates in Tai Zhou city which belongs to hot-summer and cold-winter climate zone of southern China. In order to develop the local tourism, the local government has provided guidance for the appropriate directions and opportunities for future development of this region. This study investigates the thermal comfort conditions in microclimate of this block and put forward some suggestion for the tourists determine the best time to visit, also help managers choose their business hours. In this region, humans’ thermal acceptability and the thermal comfort sensation votes are assessed based on the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET). About the future redesigning plan of this block is shown in three stages: increasing the building height; adding tree canyon coverage; changing paving material. Along with performing field measurement in this intended block, in addition, a three-dimensional microclimatic modelling tool ENVI-met 4.0 is used to evaluate the outdoor thermal comfort and validate the accuracy of the software through comparing the measured data with the simulated data. The existing scenario shows that almost the whole area is not comfortable for visiting from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm in extreme summer. After putting forward some suggestion for redesigning this area, the result shows that there is a strong improvement in broadening the cooling time, which means the more suitable time for visiting is given, the new result shows that early morning (8:00–11:00 am) and after 6:00 pm are the most comfortable time for visiting.}

abstract = {Nowadays, traditional payment methods such as cash, cheques, credit/debit cards, and bank transfers are commonly used for financial transactions across a wide range of industries, including healthcare, real estate, supply chain, gaming, music, finance, retail, agriculture, tourism, pharmaceuticals, and the education sector too. However, these methods often involve transaction fees, potential delays, and security concerns. These methods lack transparency and traceability features, making tracking, authenticating, and verifying payments and their associated records difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based online payment system that leverages blockchain technology (BT) features and security to revolutionize financial expenses in the education sector. We also present wallet generation, fee tokenization and NFT generation processes. These processes utilize Ethereum and an interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store metadata information associated with fee payment details securely. We use Remix IDE, MetaMask wallet, and Sepolia test network to deploy and analyze the proposed system's results. We have also used the JMeter simulation toolkit to conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of throughput, latency, and response time. Our assessment identifies the increase in performance parameters with the number of users. This initiative will positively contribute towards addressing the issues of financial transactions in the education sector.}

We construct a set of decentralized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models based on the basic decentralized decision mode of “votingmajority”, and we consider the assumptions that DMUs have no prior information about other DMUs’ decisions, and that they do. Then, the process of decision-making for each decision making unit (DMU) can be viewed as a social behavior over multiple time periods. Using a numerical example, we demonstrate that the new DEA models can provide acceptable efficiency results with specific weights for each DMU and can describe the details of the consensus relationship among DMUs. Similar to the market mechanism in reality, the efficiency scores of DMUs within an alliance containing more than half of the participants are overestimated, at the expense of nonallied DMUs. The models in this paper provide a possible path for efficiency measurement based on decentralized decision-making principles in complex systems.}

As a means of systematically collecting, coding and synthesising literature, we argue that scoping reviews are ideal for conducting initial environmental scans of a topic of interest, trend analyses and scenario developments. To demonstrate this utility, this paper uses a futures-oriented scoping review of technology-enhanced money laundering and terrorist financing risks as an example. At the forefront of the proposed modifications is a quality assessment framework assessing reviewed publications for their neutrality, evidence, relevance and clarity (NERC). This proposed framework is not only ideal for appraising publications but also as an indication of likelihood, namely whether their discussed insights constitute possible, plausible or probable alternative futures. The validity of the NERC framework in achieving these aims is assessed successfully through statistical correlation tests. The overall aim of this paper is to motivate the proposed modifications, the NERC framework and (modified) scoping reviews more generally as a formidable tool for informing horizon scanning, decision-making and pre-emptive policy development.}

While traditional markets use brand mechanisms to address this issue, transferring such systems to internet-based P2P markets – where misleading practices like fake ratings are rampant – remains challenging. Current internet platforms strive to counter this through verification algorithms, but these efforts find themselves in a continuous tug-of-war with counterfeit actions. Exploiting the transparency, immutability, and traceability of blockchain technology, this paper introduces a robust reputation voting system grounded in it. Unlike existing blockchain-based reputation systems, our model harnesses an intrinsically economically incentivized approach to bolster agent integrity. We optimize this model to mirror real-world user behavior, preserving the reputation system’s foundational sustainability. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, using both uniform and power-law distributions enabled by an innovative inverse transform method, we traverse a broad parameter landscape, replicating real-world complexity. The findings underscore the promise of a sustainable, transparent, and formidable reputation mechanism. Given its structure, our framework can potentially function as a universal, sustainable oracle for offchain-onchain bridging, aiding entities in perpetually cultivating their reputation. Future integration with technologies like Ring Signature and Zero Knowledge Proof could amplify the system’s privacy facets, rendering it particularly influential in the ever-evolving digital domain.}

Crisis management is another serious bottleneck due to challenges of coordinating decisions without central authorities. Informal hierarchies may also emerge—in line with organisational theoretic concept of power clawing back, which would undermine decentralization objectives. Our analysis considers anonymous reputation verification, flexibility, and transparency to have more staying power and identifies scalability as the primary obstacle—stemming from high transaction costs and throughput constraints.}

Feature selection processes were carried out to develop three distinct models, leading to a comprehensive comparative analysis. The results demonstrated that the non-linear stand-alone models (GPR, ANFIS, NN) significantly outperform the linear MVR model, with the M2 model configuration yielding the highest performance across all models. Remarkably, GPR-M2 achieved perfect model tuning with zero error rates, indicating its superior predictive capabilities. Ensemble techniques further improved performance, reflecting the experimental data's complexities in %IE modelling. The hierarchical order of performance in the training phase in the testing phase is DT-SA < MVR-SA < ANFIS-SA < NN-SA < GPR-SA. The GPR-SA ensemble emerged as the most accurate technique, substantially enhancing the predictive accuracy of the ensemble models by up to 67.73% in the training phase and 50.71% in the testing phase. These findings suggest the potential of GPR-SA in boosting the performance of ensemble approaches in material science applications. The study recommended a promising future for ML in the development and application of corrosion-inhibitors.}

Blockchain has received considerable attention recently, due to its promises of verifiable, permanent, and decentralized data handling. In 2017–2020, blockchain (and associated technologies such as smart contracts) has progressed beyond cryptocurrencies, and has been hailed as a disruptive technology for a score of industries. This study adds to the growing body of research on blockchain adoption and blockchain-driven innovation in various fields, including transport, finance, and education. However, the impact of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) on the management of science has not been systematically studied so far. This paper aims to fill the gap by studying the experience of adoption of blockchain-based solutions in academia in 2017–2020. The research is based upon a critical review of projects, relevant literature, and qualitative research: interviews (N = 24) and focus groups (N = 4) with startup founders, scholars, university executives, librarians, and IT experts from the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), Russia, and Belarus. Key challenges and barriers to blockchain adoption in academia are delineated: usability and security issues, legal concerns, conflict of values, and a critique of political dimensions of blockchain governance.}

Investor attention, sentiment, heuristics and biases, and network effects interact to form a highly volatile and dynamic market.

We further provide investors with a theoretically and empirically supported structure to better inform their decisions through an understanding of BeFi applications to DeFi.}

The research will also examine the role of a token economy in addressing trusted third-party issues related to asset ownership management. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of smart contracts, blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Web 3.0, and multifactor challenge set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFSSIA) as modern technologies to combat corruption and achieve transparency in the public sector. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) comprising peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters published between 2012 and 2023. Using the SLR methodology, 45 primary and supporting studies have been selected for result extraction and analysis.

In this way, the dream of an energy market closer to end-users becomes a reality, although, still, the regulatory framework is not clear, especially for what concerns the tokenization of assets related to investments in energy projects and energy services. The role of the blockchain technology in the energy sector has several facets: fostering Demand Response and the aggregation of loads and generators, helping the creation of energy communities and the integration of electric vehicles in the power grid, providing a more transparent and traceable relation between service providers and customers. This chapter describes current challenges and gives possible directions for the research in the field. This is done considering the possible evolutions of the regulatory framework and thus the possible implications in terms of business models.
