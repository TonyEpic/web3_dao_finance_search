abstract = {Over the next few years, there are expected to be a number of emerging trends in consumer and business technology that will directly and indirectly impact on the practice and execution of digital evidence. An organisation's ability to address the emerging trends will impact its ongoing effectiveness in meeting its mission. Leaders of the organisational digital evidence capability will be responsible for anticipating the emerging trends and market innovations, the impact that they will have on organisational capability and capacity and to ensure that the capability and capacity of the team are prepared. Anticipation and preparation for emerging trends in digital evidence results from a many faceted approach to leadership including, but not limited to, articulating a vision and a supporting narrative; the ongoing education and training of staff; budget and resources; and buy in from the organisation’s executive. A key to successfully meeting emerging trends is to not only look at the challenges that are posed by emerging technologies, but also to look at the opportunities that emerging technologies can provide to meet those evidence challenges.}

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have reached enormous levels of interest all over the world; The attraction was huge besides buying or creating an NFT. However, the actual use requires consideration of many aspects and sources to make decisions and engage in the NFT market. Moving forward and selecting what to create or where to buy, it is necessary to assess the NFT and whether it is worth investing in or not. On the other hand, Metaverse has become a trending topic and market interest has increased dramatically. However, NFT is crucial to enable the Metaverse; NFT approved its essential to the success of Metaverse adoption. In conclusion, this choice is complicated, especially when it involves extensive knowledge and information from different sources and perspectives (Engineering and Social Science). Some aspects are related to the customer experience and trust, and others are more likely to be asset-related. As we look at the blockchain market, we distinguish a variety of platforms and applications that can be used conveniently, presenting numerous options and possibilities. That brings to mind some ideas and asks some questions to assist the engagement in the NFT metaverse; When is the best moment to engage in the NFT metaverse? Is trading or engaging in the NFT metaverse trustworthy? Is it legal to use and trade NFTs, is there any need for governments to get involved? What NFT piece should create or what price to buy? What is the best and most secure platform to use? Assessing the NFTs requires deep research into different sources of controversial information and data. However, no such reference or study covers these considerations in detail; the lack of trusted resources and knowledge impacts the user experience and engagement. This paper contributes to social science studies by performing a multi-factor (comprehensive) analysis that includes the NFT Metaverse engagement decision and user behavior. We are using an extended model of the theory of planned behavior (TPB), proposing a model which includes external factors to help identify the variables that influence the engagement with NFTs in the metaverse. This comprehensive study has a multi-perspective approach; customer perspective, social perspective, technology perspective, legal perspective, and market perspective. We present extensive knowledge and information to be a helpful piece of awareness for everyone who intends to buy, invest, or create an NFT. This study uses a quantitative analysis method and provides meaningful results explaining this dilemma and the reasons behind the massive adoption of NFT and its fluctuation worldwide. This work helps the decision-makers, creators, and investors consider new development perspectives in the NFT metaverse. The methodology used primary survey data and analyzed with Smart-PLS 4 to determine variance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) using the partial least squares path modeling (PLS) method.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, prompting researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses to seek viable ways to validate the application of blockchain within their specific use cases. Blockchain decision schemes (BDSs) can assist in this decision-making process, offering a potentially more cost-effective alternative to domain experts. Flow chart blockchain decision schemes (FC-BDSs) constitute 77.5% of all BDSs, and this paper systematically reviews these by standardising and aggregating the most prominent schemes into an open-source package. Central to our approach is the definition of an FC-BDS as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Upon this mathematical foundation, we engage in a meticulous exploration and analysis of various elements within FC-BDSs. We present an in-depth analysis of the structure of FC-BDSs, exploring features such as vertex count, question categorisation, and outcome distribution. Notably, the majority of FC-BDS questions ask about data and participation (34.1%) above other domains such as security (18.6%) and performance (10.8%). Observations regarding outcomes shows an overall balance in suggesting the usage or avoidance of blockchains; however, there is a discrepancy between the average questions required to reach these outcomes, revealing potential biases within schemes. Further analysis using similarity metrics (based on both structural and semantic features) identifies significant overlaps between FC-BDSs, with some schemes showing over 90% similarity. These observations could be attributed to a more informal publishing routine for FC-BDSs, and help trace the evolution of FC-BDSs over time. The insights drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the broader BDSs landscape, and stand to make significant strides towards the standardisation of FC-BDSs, thereby promoting a more coherent and effective utilisation of these decision-making tools in the realm of blockchain technology application.}

However, the majority of the previous studies have focused on the technical aspects, and overlooked blockchain investigation from a managerial perspective. In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions—transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement—, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.}

Two auction price systems and several settlement mechanisms are formulated and compared to assess local trading profit and local market efficiency. We also implement a SC-based mechanism that embeds the auction results and rules to increase trust in the bidding and settlement processes. Our simulations use actual consumption and generation data from 11 houses with smart appliances and self-generation capabilities. We show that auctions, if used consistently, can help the development of a local trade by encouraging people to buy from their neighbors and invest in more generating facilities, knowing that there is a local market on which to rely. Compared to the hybrid - Pay-as-Bid (PaB) in the 1st round plus Uniform Price (UP) in the 2nd round - approach, the pure 2-round UP auction was shown to decrease trading with the retailer by 7.5%. The market indicators are quite similar for the two pricing methods, whereas the proposed settlement mechanism reduces the buyers' payments by 7% and increases sellers' encashments by around 8%.}

This has given rise to many smart contract applications in areas ranging from financial services, life sciences and healthcare to energy resources and voting. However, due to their infancy, smart contracts still pose many challenges that encumber the stakeholders who interact with them: users, developers and the organisations that are built on top of smart contracts. This study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge of smart contracts within blockchain technology. Based on a systematic mapping study, we offer a broad perspective on their problems and corresponding solutions, present the research trends within the area and compile the 64 papers identified, grouped by top publication sources, channels, methods and approaches. We conclude that, since 2016, there has been an increasing trend towards the publication of blockchain-based smart contract articles at conferences and journals, mainly reflecting experiments and presenting methods, tools and models. According to the results, the most commonly discussed problems and solutions in the literature are related to the security, privacy and scalability of blockchain and the programmability of smart contracts.}

It creates not only a more secure and transparent energy provisioning mechanism, but also promotes a local ecosystem in which key stakeholders (prosumers, consumers, and utilities and grid operators) can mutually benefit from each other. After discussing the main issues with traditional support policies, this chapter presents the NRGcoin concept in details.

A key innovation within ReFi is the tokenization of carbon credits. Consequently, this study explores the return connectedness among ReFi, carbon, fossil energy, and clean energy markets, employing a quantile time–frequency connectedness framework. Our findings indicate a relatively weak and time-varying trend in return connectedness. Notably, the pairwise connectedness within the ReFi-carbon-energy system becomes more pronounced during extreme market conditions compared to normal conditions. Moreover, clean energy markets of all sub-sectors serve as net spillover transmitters across different quantiles and time–frequency domains. In contrast, ReFi markets act as net receivers in the short term but evolve into net transmitters in the medium term, especially under extreme market conditions. Next, we examine the impacts of determinants on total connectedness, which demonstrate heterogeneity across different time horizons and market conditions. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of ReFi assets as effective diversification and hedging tools for carbon-energy portfolios. Our findings not only provide guidance for ReFi investors in constructing more cost-effective investment strategies, but also assist ReFi policymakers in cultivating a broader and trustworthier application of ReFi.}

The rational design of surfactant tails bearing a limited number of short side chains has been proposed as a suitable strategy to meet this demand, with negligible effects on biodegradability. In this work, we investigate a mixed surfactant system, in which the branched surfactant N,N-dimethyl-2-propylheptan-1-amine oxide (C10DAO-branched) is combined with a linear alkyl ethoxysulfate one (AES). For comparison, we also study the mixtures in which the branched amine oxide is replaced by its linear isomer (C10DAO-linear). The phase behavior of this surfactant mixture in water is investigated across the entire composition range by polarized optical microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. Moreover, the shear viscosities and viscoelastic moduli of representative samples are determined by rheological measurements. C10DAO-branched/AES aqueous mixtures form isotropic micellar solution and lamellar structures. Low viscosity was found for all these mixtures, including the most concentrated ones. In contrast, in C10DAO-linear/AES mixtures an extended hexagonal phase is detected, which presents a high viscosity. These results demonstrate tail branching and mixed aggregation to synergistically contribute to the design of high-concentration low-viscosity surfactant mixtures.}

The aim of this study was to describe the role of intestinal fatty acid–binding protein (iFABP) and allergy-related diamine oxidase (DAO) in patients with heat stroke (HS).
Methods
A total of 10 patients with HS in intensive care unit and 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The plasma intestinal permeability markers iFABP and DAO were measured since the time of admission. The whole blood endotoxin was also assessed. The associations between iFABP, DAO, and endotoxin level were analyzed. Then, white blood cell count, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein were examined. In addition, we also determined the levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α.
Results
Comparing with the healthy control, the plasma iFABP and DAO level in patients with HS increased significantly (P < .05). The kinetic curve showed that plasma iFABP and DAO level reached peak value at day 3 and day 4 after admission, respectively. The endotoxin level was positively correlated with iFABP and DAO level. We also observed a significantly increased level of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein but not white blood count in patients with HS. After treatment, the iFABP and DAO level decreased significantly (P < .05). A significant increase in level of IL-1α and IL-6 was also found in patients with HS.
Conclusions
The plasma concentrations of DAO and iFABP could reflect a better function of the intestinal mucosa barrier in patients with HS. Plasma iFABP and DAO level decreased significantly after the treatment and, thus, might be a predictor for the severity of HS.}

Rhubarb is the peeled and dried roots of Rheum palmatum L. and Rheum tanguticum Maxim. ex Balf. or Rheum officinale Baill. Free total rhubarb anthraquinones (FTRAs) were isolated and extracted from rhubarb. Previous studies have revealed that the early administration of FTRAs protects the intestinal mucosal barrier in rats with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), the mechanism of which is not yet clear. However, we observed an enhanced expression of intestinal pyroptotic factors in rats treated with SAP, which may be related to the mechanism of intestinal barrier protection by FTRAs.
Aim of the study
The main objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which FTRAs protect the intestinal mucosal barrier in SAP rats, focusing on the classical pyroptosis pathway.
Materials and methods
SAP was induced in rats through retrograde injection of sodium taurocholate via the pancreaticobiliary duct. Subsequently, FTRAs (22.5, 45, and 90 mg/kg), rhubarb (900 mg/kg, positive control), and saline (control) were administered at 0 h (immediately), 12 h, and 24 h post-surgery. Pancreatic and intestinal tissue injury, positive PI staining rate, and expression levels of various factors in intestinal tissues were compared across different groups. These factors include diamine oxidase (DAO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1(HMGB1) and pro-inflammatory factors in intestinal and serum, pyroptosis-associated factors, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), cysteine protease-1 (caspase-1) and Gasdermin (GSDMD).
Results
The findings indicated that FTRAs protected the damaged intestine and pancreas and restored the expression of intestinal epithelial junction proteins in SAP rats. Additionally, it reduced intestinal and serum levels of DAO, interleukin 1, interleukin 18, HMGB1, and LDH, attenuated intestinal Positive PI staining rate, and significantly decreased the expressions of TLR-4, NF-kB, ASC, NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDMD in SAP rats.
Conclusions
The results suggest that FTRAs inhibited pyroptosis through down-regulation of the NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD and TLR-4- NF-kB signaling pathways of intestinal tissues., thereby protecting the intestinal barrier of SAP rats.}

Brackish water has attracted increasing attention as a promising source to augment fresh water supply in many areas around the world. However, the ubiquitously high content of arsenic in brackish water presents a vexing technical challenge to reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants. In this study, an integrated RO/vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) process was investigated for enhanced As(III) removal and water recoveries of brackish water desalination without requirement of pre-oxidation step as in other conventional treatment processes. The experimental results demonstrate that As(III) removal and water flux of the single RO process were profoundly affected by the conditions of the brackish water feed and the process water recovery. At pH 10, the As(III) removal maximized at 90%, and sharply dropped to below 80% as the process water recovery exceeded 70%. Exceeding the process water recovery of 70% also significantly reduced the RO process water flux. On the other hand, the VMD process was able to further treat concentrated RO brines with a 100% As(III) removal and stable water flux. Thanks to advantage of VMD, the integrated RO/VMD process at the global water recovery of 95.5% achieved adequate global As(III) removal, bringing the As(III) concentration in the product water down to below the 10-ppb allowable maximum limit.}

In this review article, we investigate state-of-the-art characteristics of IoWT to identify its advancements and benefits from 6G technologies. First, IoWT oriented 6G technologies such as long-range low-power communications, ultra-reliable low-latency communications, and in-network intelligent computing services are demonstrated. Subsequently, we describe three typical IoWT interconnectivity architectures including wearables-to-wearables, wearables-to-hub, and wearables-to-infrastructure topologies that facilitate the exchange of IoWT information with the Internet. Next, the three IoWT systems (i.e., wearable, implantable, and molecular communications) are analyzed, which are then followed by their application scenarios. Finally, we discuss open challenges to drive future research in the fields toward the maturation of the IoWT.}

Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker’s revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.}

Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.}

As a result, it is anticipated that innovative energy-conversion technologies with great energy densities and environmental friendliness will offer trustworthy substitutes for conventional fossil-based energy systems. Nevertheless, since expensive precious metals must always be used as electrode catalysts for such devices, their widespread usage is severely hampered. Due to the increase in atomic distance and downshift in the d-band center of metal atoms caused by the entry of nitrogen atoms into the metal lattice, SMNs display surface and adsorption properties that are comparable to noble metals. In the next generation of energy storage and energy-conversion devices, SMNs have emerged as one of the best electrode materials to take the role of noble metal-based electrocatalysts. The most recent advancements in the use of SMNs for electrocatalysis are discussed in this paper. Firstly, the discussion of the origins of SMNs’ structure and activity before introducing the typical synthesis techniques used to create SMNs. Following that, it is necessary to provide examples of how mono- and multi-metallic SMNs are used in oxygen reduction, evolution, and bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Finally, the summarization of the difficulties SMNs are currently facing and projecting their future growth. Moreover, it is worth noting that the novelty of this paper is the updated reference would be carried out in this work to add scientific value and enhance the quality of the theoretical study as well as approach the cutting-edge trend all over the world.}

In this study, we conducted metagenomic and metabolomic analyses on samples from high-fat diet-fed (HFD) hamsters treated with IMMH007. Our findings revealed that IMM-H007 reversed the imbalance of gut microbiota caused by a high-fat diet. Additionally, it activated adiponectin receptor and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway-related genes, which are known to regulate lipid and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, IMM-H007 promotes cholesterol metabolism by reducing the abundance of genes and species associated with 7α-dehydroxylation and bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Metabolomics and pharmacological studies have shown that IMM-H007 effectively improved glucose and lipid metabolism disorders caused by HFD, reduced the aggregation of secondary bile acids (SBAs), significantly increased the content of hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), and also activated the expression of VDR in the small intestine. As a result, there was a reduction in the leakage of diamine oxidase (DAO) into the bloodstream in hamsters, accompanied by an upregulation of ZO-1 expression in the small intestine. The results suggested that IMM-H007 regulated glucose and lipid metabolism, promoted cholesterol metabolism through activating the expression of VDR, inhibiting inflammatory and improving the permeability of the intestinal barrier. Thus, our study provides new understanding of how IMM-H007 interacts with intestinal function, microbiota, and relevant targets, shedding light on its mechanism of action.}

The rationale is that digital transformation was found to support the decentralisation of public governance, improving overall organisational efficiency and the creation of added public value for citizens. Based on a systematic literature review and fifteen semi-structured interviews with public sector experts, the paper discusses how digital transformation enables the decentralisation of public governance. Digital transformation supports public organisations’ efforts to gain the most out of public governance decentralisation as it improves the efficiency of local and federal governments, citizen participation, citizen empowerment, public trust, and continuance of public administration.}

Due to their self-executing, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.}

The results indicate that research on SHM for O&G pipelines is booming, and the field has diversified. Existing publications have examined SHM from the perspectives of tool research and development (R&D), data processing, analysis algorithms, and failure diagnosis. Over time, SHM of O&G pipelines has evolved into a transdisciplinary research field, covering many emerging areas beyond engineering and instruments instrumentation, optics, computer sciences, physics, materials science, and energy fuels. In terms of application, scores of models and methods have been developed using advanced technology to model and predict pipeline risk and failure using SHM data. Relevant SHM of O&G pipeline topics can be divided into four research clusters: (i) damage identification, (ii) leak detection, (iii) machine learning, and (iv) data preprocessing. This study determines the knowledge gaps in SHM of O&G pipeline research. Future needs were provided, such as data coupling, coordination of different monitoring categories, and sensor location optimization. Advanced SHM equipment should be developed for O&G pipelines under potential extreme disasters. It is possible to increase the evaluation of the value of SHM information to optimize decision-making.

Breakthroughs of scientific and technological developments in recent decades allow us to build computers and robots that parallel or even surpass human abilities in many respects. The superhuman achievements are based on a new generation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with neural networks using Deep Learning (DL). The performance of these AI systems increases exponentially, which requires exponentially increasing resources as well, including data, computational power, and energy. This development is not sustainable and there is a need for new AI approaches, which give careful consideration to limited resources. In this chapter, we discuss how new AI could benefit from lessons learnt from human brains, human intelligence, and human constraints. We describe various aspects of biological and artificial intelligence. We introduce a balanced approach based on the concepts of complementarity and multistability as manifested in human brain operation and cognitive processing. This approach provides insights into key principles of intelligence in biological brains and it helps building sustainable artificial intelligence.}

Thus, in contrast to earlier iterations of the web, Web3 users are asked to trust the technology itself rather than the human intermediaries. On its face, this shift to a trustless web calls into question the traditional conceptions of and requirements for trust. However, in this article, we caution against claims that advocate distrusting Web3 on the basis that, despite how quickly Web3 technology is advancing, the psychological processes through which people perceive and make sense of the social world remain fundamentally unchanged. Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research. Overall, this article provides critical guidance to brand managers, policy advisors, and academics seeking to understand, build, and trust Web3 technology.}

While several applications of this technology exist, the key underlying factor in NFTs’ success is in their potential for investment – buying, selling, and trading the digital assets such as artwork or video game items using cryptocurrency. The rise and mid-2022 crash of NFT and associated crypto markets have shown the volatility of the sector, and questions have been raised around the sustainability, environmental impact, and exploitative practices within this space – and whether there are, in fact, any possible socially responsible use cases for NFTs. This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature surrounding NFTs, primarily through a thorough ethical analysis of the technology and its implementation, deployment, and sustainability. To do this, it uses the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct as a framework for analysis and, following this analysis, makes some recommendations for those wishing to investigate and/or implement NFTs in an ethically responsible manner. The key message is that unless there is absolutely no other way to solve a problem other than using NFTs, then they should not be implemented, as there is currently no ethical use case or means of implementation of NFTs.}

abstract = {Since Bitcoin, the blockchain space considerably evolved. One crucial piece of software to interact with blockchains and hold private-public key pairs to distinct crypto-assets and securities are wallets. Wallet software can be offered by liable third-parties (‘custodians’) who hold certain rights over assets and transactions. As parties subject to financial regulation, they are to uphold Anti-money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorist (AML/CFT) standards by undertaking Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks on users of their services. In juxtaposition, wallet software can also be issued without the involvement of a liable third-party. As no KYC is performed and users have full ‘freedom to act’, such ‘non-custodial’ wallet software is popular in criminal undertakings. They are required to interact with peer-to-peer applications and organisations running on blockchains whose benefits are not the subject of this paper. To date, financial regulation fails to adequately address such wallet software because it presumes the existence of a registered, liable entity offering said software. As illustrated in the case of Tornado Cash, financial regulation fails to trace chains of secondary liability. Alas, the considered solution is a systematic surveillance of all transactions. Against this backdrop, this paper sets forth an alternative approach rooted in copyright law. Concepts that pertain to secondary liability prove of value to develop a flexible, principles-based approach to the regulation of non-custodial wallet software that accounts for both, infringing and non-infringing uses.}

The evolving epidemiologic patterns of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) throughout the world, in conjunction with advances in therapeutic treatments, may influence hospitalization rates of IBD. We performed a systematic review with temporal analysis of hospitalization rates for IBD across the world in the 21st century.
Methods
We systematically reviewed Medline and Embase for population-based studies reporting hospitalization rates for IBD, Crohn’s disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) in the 21st century. Log-linear models were used to calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) with associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Random-effects meta-analysis pooled country-level AAPCs. Data were stratified by the epidemiologic stage of a region: compounding prevalence (stage 3) in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania vs acceleration of incidence (stage 2) in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America vs emergence (stage 1) in developing countries.
Results
Hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis of IBD were stable in countries in stage 3 (AAPC, −0.13%; 95% CI, −0.72 to 0.97), CD (AAPC, 0.20%; 95% CI, −1.78 to 2.17), and UC (AAPC, 0.02%; 95% CI, −0.91 to 0.94). In contrast, hospitalization rates for a primary diagnosis were increasing in countries in stage 2 for IBD (AAPC, 4.44%; 95% CI, 2.75 to 6.14), CD (AAPC, 8.34%; 95% CI, 4.38 to 12.29), and UC (AAPC, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.29 to 6.52). No population-based studies were available for developing regions in stage 1 (emergence).
Conclusions
Hospitalization rates for IBD are stabilizing in countries in stage 3, whereas newly industrialized countries in stage 2 have rapidly increasing hospitalization rates, contributing to an increasing burden on global health care systems.}

For supporting this hypothesis, striking analogies between the concepts underlying blockchain technology with research are identified, and applied to the generation of verified knowledge in science and technology development. It is then elaborated how a blockchain-enabled token economy can efficiently and transparently incentivize and coordinate an integrative and community-inclusive participatory approach to fuel crowdsourcing of collective intelligence for contributing ideas, work, infrastructure, funding, data, validation, management, assessment, governance, arbitration and exploitation of projects. Quality, credibility and direction of projects are optimized by demanding collateral “skin-in-the-game” from contributors based on blockchain-enabled staking, reputation systems and prediction markets. This way research progress emerges as a chain of community generated and independently vetted blocks of scientific knowledge; these new blocks are concatenated with the state-of-the-art according to transparent consensus mechanisms.}

In the first stage, pentane, heptane and refinery untreated/ treated naphtha streams (Light Naphtha (LN), Heavy Naphtha (HN) & Raffinate Naphtha (RN)) were investigated for deasphalting performance. To enhance the deasphalting, spent catalyst from Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) is used in the first stage which showed increase deasphalted oil (DAO) and also pitch yields up to 2 wt%. In the second stage, six polar solvents viz. sulfolane, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), tri-ethylene glycol, tetra-ethylene glycol, furfural and N-formylmorpholine (NFM) have been analyzed for dearomatization. The phase equilibria behaviour of these six potential polar solvents was investigated, including the interaction behaviour of their components with heavy oil components using ternary phase diagrams at ambient conditions, before selecting the most suitable solvent for dearomatization. Based on the phase equilibria data, distribution coefficient, selectivity, and performance index (PI) of the solvents was also estimated. For the oils which have C6–C15 carbon range, the universal quasi-chemical UNIQAC model was used to predict the liquid–liquid equilibria (LLE) and solvent NMP gave highest performance index for the high carbon number feedstock. The effects of solvent types and solvent to feed ratio on the deasphalting performance was also investigated. Finally, the DAO obtained at each stage was fed to a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) bench-scale unit and the results showed significant improvement in gasoline yields up to 5 wt% and the coke was also lowered to 2 wt%.}

In light of an aging global population, understanding adverse events (AEs) in surgeries for older adults is crucial for optimal outcomes and patient safety.
Research question
Our study compares surgical outcomes and AEs in patients aged 65–79 with those aged ≥80, focusing on clinical outcomes, morbidity and mortality rates, and age-related risk factors for AEs.
Material and methods
Our study, from January 2019 to December 2022, involved patients aged 65–79 and ≥ 80 undergoing spinal surgery. Each patient was evaluated for AEs post-discharge, defined as negative clinical outcomes within 30 days post-surgery. Patients were categorized based on primary spinal diagnoses: degenerative, oncological, traumatic, and infectious.
Results
We enrolled 546 patients aged 65–79 and 184 octogenarians. Degenerative diseases were most common in both groups, with higher infection and tumor rates in the younger cohort. Octogenarians had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index and longer ICU/hospital stays. Surgery-related AE rates were 8.1% for 65-79-year-olds and 15.8% for octogenarians, with mortality around 2% in both groups.
Discussion and conclusion
Our prospective analysis shows octogenarians are more susceptible to surgical AEs, linked to greater health complexities. Despite higher AEs in older patients, low mortality rates across both age groups highlight the safety of spinal surgery. Tracking AEs is crucial for patient communication and impacts healthcare accreditation and funding.}

abstract = {Objective
To investigate the mechanisms that underlie the anti-asthmatic effects of Nepeta bracteata (DBJJ, Dabao Jingjie in Chinese) in rats by integrating metabolomics and network pharmacology.
Methods
In this study, the rat model of asthma was induced by using ovalbumin (OVA), and subsequently, the rats were treated with a decoction of N. bracteata. Pathological changes in lung tissue were observed, and the quantification of eosinophils (EOS) and white blood cells (WBC) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed. Furthermore, the serum levels of asthma-related factors induced by OVA were assessed. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy serum metabolomics method was utilized to identify differential metabolites and their associated metabolic pathways. Moreover, UPLC-QE-MS/MS combined with network pharmacology was employed to predict the core targets and pathways of DBJJ in its action against asthma. Furthermore, the anti-asthmatic properties of DBJJ were investigated using an integrated approach of metabolomics and network pharmacology. Subsequently, the findings were validated through molecular docking and Western blotting analysis of the key targets.
Results
The findings indicated that the administration of DBJJ effectively alleviated OVA-induced lung histopathological changes and decreased the number of EOS and WBC in BALF. Additionally, DBJJ inhibited the OVA-induced elevation of TNF-α, IL-18, Ig-E, EOS, IL-1β, MDA, VEGF-A, and TGF-β1. A total of 21 biomarkers and 10 pathways were found by metabolomics analysis. The 29 compounds were identified by UPLC-QE-MS/MS and 13 active components were screened by oral availability and Caco-2 cell permeability, the 120 targets and 173 KEGG pathways were predicted. The integration of metabolomics and network pharmacological analysis revealed that DBJJ's primary constituents, including ferulic acid and ursolic acid, exerted their effects on four targets, namely DAO and NOS2, as well as their associated metabolites and pathways. The active constituents of DBJJ demonstrated a high binding affinity towards DAO and NOS2. Furthermore, DBJJ was observed to decrease the protein expression and phosphorylation levels of NOS2, MAPK, and STAT3.
Conclusion
The administration of DBJJ demonstrates notable anti-asthma properties in rats with allergic asthma. This effect can be attributed to the modulation of various targets, including NOS2, MAPK, and STAT3, by primary constituents such as ferulic acid and ursolic acid.}

Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article reviews blockchain’s computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain.}

abstract = {Background
Public health guidelines recommend delaying the initiation age for alcohol. However, the causal link between age-at-first-drink (AFD) and future alcohol use in young adulthood is uncertain. This study examined the association between AFD and alcohol-related outcomes at age 20 years using an Australian sample.
Methods
Data were obtained from Waves 1–19 (years 2001–2019) of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey on 20-year-olds with responses across ≥3 consecutive waves (n = 2278). The AFD for each respondent (between 15 and 20 years) was analysed relative to Australian legal drinking age (18 years). Inverse probability treatment weighting was used to evaluate associations between AFD and four outcomes at age 20 years: risk of current alcohol use; quantity of weekly alcohol consumption; risk of binge drinking; and frequency of binge drinking. Adjustments were made for confounders (e.g., heavy drinking by parents). Robustness of study findings was evaluated using several diagnostic tests/sensitivity analyses.
Results
Among 20-year-olds, those with an AFD of 15–16 years consumed significantly more alcohol per week compared to an AFD of 18 years. Additionally, 20-year-old drinkers with an AFD of 16 years were significantly more likely to binge drink (though this association was likely confounded). An inverse dose-response relationship was observed between AFD and weekly alcohol consumption at 20 years, where a higher AFD led to lower alcohol consumption.
Conclusion
Study findings indicate an association between a higher AFD and consuming less alcohol in young adulthood, which could potentially support the scale-up of prevention programs to delay AFD among Australian adolescents.}

The disruption, and disintermediation made possible by blockchains has rightfully received increasing attention from entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurship researchers alike. In this article, I broaden these perspectives by paying particular attention to trust in blockchains, and contrasting it with perspectives on trust from Transaction Cost Economics, Agency Theory, and the Resource Based View. In sum, I compare perspectives on trust in these traditional theories to the conception of trust in blockchains – a mix of algorithmic, and organizational – to offer new insights into the implications of the rise of blockchains.}

Despite offering various services, the integration and seamless data exchange among different modes of transportation remain challenging. To address this, research was conducted to examine the current state of integration in the MOD ecosystem, identify gaps in data exchange, and propose policy considerations. The research highlighted the limited integration and inconsistent data structures in the United States (U.S.), attributed to the absence of policy directives and high costs of traditional standards development. Industry-led initiatives are driving progress in standards and specifications. Deep linking and deep integration were distinguished, emphasizing the importance of a truly user-centric MOD solution. Emerging mobility models leveraging blockchain technology show promise in facilitating efficient data sharing and collaboration among various operators. Transportation policy makers play a crucial role in supporting open-source standards and integration efforts. An initial framework utilizing open-source efforts such as Transport Operator Mobility-as-a-service Provider (TOMP), Mobility Data Specification (MDS), General On-demand Feed Specification (GOFS), Transactional Data Specification (TDS), Operational Data Standard (ODS), and City Data Standard for Mobility (CDS-M) was proposed to drive the advancement of scalable and user-centric MOD systems.}

Each one of these encounters becomes a part of the many records stored somewhere in the archives of healthcare data. Much of the data is merely entered into a computer system so that the provider can receive payment, and then the data are added to a massive “warehouse.” Each one of these records can provide insight not only into an individual’s well-being but may, in fact, affect healthcare across similar groups based on age, gender, or location, and provide an analytic base to determine insurance rates, study disease trends, and modify treatment protocols. This administrative type of information claims and encounters eligibility and enrollment is still vastly underused. This is due in part to the massive amounts of administrative data, in part to their complexity, and in part to their misuse in the past.

abstract = {Aortic valve disease is often treated with bioprosthetic valves. An alternative treatment is aortic valve neocuspidization which is a relatively new reparative procedure whereby the three aortic cusps are replaced with patient pericardium or bovine tissues. Recent research indicates that aortic blood flow is disturbed, and turbulence effects have yet to be evaluated in either bioprosthetic or aortic valve neocuspidization valve types in patient-specific settings. The aim of this study is to better understand turbulence production in the aorta and evaluate its effects on laminar and turbulent wall shear stress. Four patients with aortic valve disease were treated with either bioprosthetic valves (n=2) or aortic valve neocuspidization valvular repair (n=2). Aortic geometries were segmented from magnetic resonance images (MRI), and 4D flow MRI was used to derive physiological inlet and outlet boundary conditions. Pulsatile large-eddy simulations were performed to capture the full range of laminar, transitional and turbulence characteristics in the aorta. Turbulence was produced in all aortas with highest levels occurring during systolic deceleration. In the ascending aorta, turbulence production is attributed to a combination of valvular skew, valvular eccentricity, and ascending aortic dilation. In the proximal descending thoracic aorta, turbulence production is dependent on the type of arch-descending aorta connection (e.g., a narrowing or sharp bend) which induces flow separation. Laminar and turbulent wall shear stresses are of similar magnitude throughout late systolic deceleration and diastole, although turbulent wall shear stress magnitudes exceed laminar wall shear stresses between 27.3% and 61.1% of the cardiac cycle. This emphasises the significance of including turbulent wall shear stress to improve our comprehension of progressive arterial wall diseases. The findings of this study recommend that aortic valve treatments should prioritise minimising valvular eccentricity and skew in order to mitigate turbulence generation.}

The decentralized architecture of blockchain offers greater security for distributed systems. Although, there have been some concerns raised about the robustness of blockchain technology. Numerous cybersecurity flaws have been found in blockchain implementations. Blockchain technology enables transactions to be more transparent than the old centralized systems. Hence, the blockchain technology has been exposed to numerous vulnerable cyberattacks. As a result, cyberattacks lead to system breakdown, data loss, password thefts, and information theft.

Drawing on Stiegler's theory of transindividuation, understood as the trans-formation of individuals, groups and technologies, and his emphasis on technology-mediated memory, we propose that varying types of accounting records cultivate different memory forms by fostering spatiotemporal projections which reshape the societal perception and comprehension of accounting. Our analysis relies on a comparison between two decentralized transaction recording systems similar in their operations, but which emerged in two different eras: blockchain and early double-entry bookkeeping. Our approach draws from Haydu (1998) to identify similarities and contrasts between different periods which can emphasize the uniqueness of each, while conceptualizing long-term trends. By juxtaposing DEB and BC as instances of decentralized records, the study postulates a critical shift in accounting's transindividuation over time. We argue that while DEB's norms of recording aided in the formation of collective memory and long-term projections, turning records into objects of social investment, BC's recording, propelled by automation and an economic emphasis, manifests as an isolated numerical sequence hindering the scope of human projections. We posit that compared to early DEB, BC recording, although it holds the potential for democratization, may lead to divisions between users, among themselves, and with their records. We discuss the potential implications of this trans-dividuation process for notions of accountability, transparency, regulation, and the broader political role of accounting in society.}

This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.}

The method was successfully implemented for payments to 7 subcontractors in two real-world commercial construction projects in Canada and United States where progress was captured using a camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The method eliminates reliance on today's heavily intermediated payment applications and showed promise for achieving accurate, efficient, and timely payment administration.

abstract = {In recent years, cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been to many vital areas, including medical devices, smart cars, industrial systems, energy grid, etc. As these systems increasingly rely on Internet, ensuring their security requirements, which are different from those of ordinary information technology systems, has become an important research topic. However, the area is not yet well structured and, therefore, it is essential to review and analyze recent work in this field to better understand the adopted approaches and also to identify corresponding gaps and future interesting research directions. This article is based on a systematic literature review that addresses core issues in CPS security. Part of the focus is placed on the defense mechanisms introduced to help the system fully recover from attacks. However, the framework devoted to risk/threat assessments has also been highlighted, as there is a substantial need to strengthen the systems architecture to be more proactive. In addition, the ethical and societal impact of CPS is emphasized since it is essential to get a vision of the unintended outcomes of the possible evolution of these systems.}

abstract = {The landscape of electronic marketplaces has been monopolized by a handful of market operators that have accumulated tremendous power during the last decades. This trend raises concerns about fairness and market manipulation by these operators acting as gatekeepers. These concerns have recently been outlined in the EU Digital Markets Act (DMA). In this work, we highlight how technological logic of separation understood in the framework of decentralization can address manipulation concerns. As a first step, we devise a reference model of electronic marketplaces, containing six functional components, and outline how control over these components enables different manipulative practices by gatekeepers. We identify two dimensions of decentralization that can counterbalance monopolistic abuse of marketplace components. We then present a software implementation of our reference model and demonstrate how decentralization and unbundling of market components can alleviate manipulation and fairness concerns. We end our work with a review of related approaches and conclude that modular and interoperable marketplaces can enable an open ecosystem of fair electronic markets envisioned by the DMA.}

This review assesses the potential of blockchain technology to enhance the hydrogen economy, a vital component in advancing global sustainable energy initiatives. Findings from comprehensive literature reviews and specific case studies, including “HydroChain” and “H2-Share,” are synthesized to evaluate blockchain's ability to improve transparency, efficiency, and compliance within hydrogen production, storage, and distribution systems. The results indicate that blockchain technology could significantly enhance hydrogen traceability and certification, facilitate robust peer-to-peer energy trading platforms, and strengthen market dynamics through improved logistical operations. However, notable challenges such as scalability, interoperability among diverse blockchain systems, and the need for adaptive regulatory frameworks are identified as major barriers to its full adoption. Addressing these challenges will require a multidisciplinary approach and proactive collaboration among stakeholders to develop scalable blockchain solutions that can effectively integrate with existing technologies. The successful implementation of blockchain in the hydrogen sector could greatly contribute to achieving net-zero emissions and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, providing a replicable model for other sectors in the energy industry.}

abstract = {Inflammatory reactions after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (AICH) contribute significantly to a poor prognosis. Liangxue Tongyu Prescription (LTP) has been proven to be clinically effective in treating AICH. Numerous studies have shown that LTP suppresses brain inflammatory damage in AICH, while the internal mechanisms underlying its action remain unclear. The aim of this study was to verify the anti-inflammatory effects of LTP on an AICH rat model and investigate the potential mechanisms. The AICH rat models were created by injecting autologous blood into the right caudate nucleus. LTP markedly decreased cerebral hematoma and brain water content and recovered from neurological deficits. Meanwhile, LTP prevented microglial activation and reduced the inflammatory reaction caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Notably, the expression of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) in the brain and intestine was increased by LTP or CCK-8 treatment. LTP further suppressed nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in the brains of rats with AICH. Moreover, LTP increased the protein and mRNA expression of Occludin and Claudin-1 in the intestine and decreased the levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and diamine oxidase (DAO) in serum. Furthermore, the results showed that LTP increased the protein and mRNA expression of Claudin-5 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in the brain. CCK-8 receptor antagonists increased the expression of NF-κB and the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggested that LTP attenuated neuroinflammation by increasing CCK-8 in the brain and intestine, and its mechanism might be related to alterations in the gut-brain axis (GBA).}

Digital currencies’ rigidly inflexible supply and wildly fluctuating demand make them too unstable to be used as a unit of account for the foreseeable future. Of the five, only Bitcoin has the potential to serve as a store of value, due to its strict commitment to low supply growth, credibly backed by the network’s distributed protocol and credible demonstration of the absence of any authority capable of altering the supply schedule. Other cryptocurrencies’ centralized control, and use as tokens for specific applications make them unlikely to fulfil monetary functions.}

keywords = {Hepatitis B virus, Vaccination, Elimination, Survey, Adult, Viet Nam, Lower-middle-income country},
abstract = {Background
Gaps in adult hepatitis B vaccination were undefined in Vietnam, a lower-middle-income country. To address these gaps, this study defined hepatitis B vaccine coverage in adults and its associated factors in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Viet Nam. We also proposed interventional strategies, prioritizing gap identification to facilitate hepatitis B elimination by 2030 and beyond.
Method
During 2019–2020, a multi-stage cluster serosurvey with probability proportional to size was conducted to representatively invite 20,000 adults (18 years or older) throughout HCMC for hepatitis B screening (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc). Serologic results defined two dependent variables: vaccine-induced immunity (i.e., isolated anti-HBs) and susceptibility (i.e., HBV naive). Associations of dependent variables with surveyed demographics, socioeconomic statuses, behaviors, and medical history at risk for hepatitis B were evaluated using weighted Poisson regression.
Results
The prevalence was 18.5% (95%CI, 17.3-20.0%) for vaccine-induced immunity and 37.7% (35.6-39.8%) for susceptibility. Even though analyses in the general population revealed a falling trend in vaccine-induced immunity prevalence from younger to older age groups, sensitivity analyses in the non-infected population (i.e., those who were both negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc) showed that younger age groups, especially those aged 30 to 50 years, had the lowest prevalence. Social inequalities existed in different ethnicities, residence areas, education levels, house ownership, and health insurance statuses. There was no significant association between vaccine-induced immunity or susceptibility and risky behaviors and medical histories.
Conclusion
This study depicts a significant unmet need for hepatitis B vaccination in the general adult population in HCMC, Viet Nam. Indeed, the lack of vaccination was unevenly distributed regarding age groups, geographical areas, and socioeconomic statuses, which reveals profound social disparities. Therefore, to achieve hepatitis B elimination goals, besides the current recommendations for infants and risk-based strategies, hepatitis B vaccination should be recommended for the broader population.}

While security threats are changing their strategies and constructing new threats on blockchain-based IoT systems. Also, in combining blockchain with IoT networks, malicious transactions and active attacks deliver more vulnerabilities, privacy issues, and security threats. The concept of blockchain-based IoT attacks is a hot topic in both IoT and blockchain disciplines. Network attacks are a type of security and privacy threat and cover the exact scope of threats related to the combination of IoT and blockchain. Even though blockchain has potential security benefits, new cyberattacks have emerged that make blockchain alone insufficient to deal with threats and attacks in IoT networks since vagueness and ambiguity issues are unavoidable in IoT data. The heterogeneous nature of IoT sources has made uncertainty a critical issue in IoT networks. Deep Learning (DL) models have difficulty dealing with uncertainty issues and cannot manage them efficiently as an essential tool in security techniques. Thus, we need better security, privacy, and practical approaches, such as efficient threat detection against network attacks in blockchain-based IoT environments. Also helpful to consider fuzzy logic to tackle deterministic issues when DL models face uncertainty. This paper designs and implements a secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework. This framework utilizes a novel fuzzy DL model, optimized adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based attack detection, fuzzy matching (FM), and fuzzy control system (FCS) for detection of network attacks. The proposed fuzzy DL applies the fuzzy Choquet integral to have a powerful nonlinear aggregation function in the detection. We use metaheuristic algorithms to optimize the attack detection error function in ANFIS. We also validate transactions via FM to tackle fraud detection and efficiency in the blockchain layer. This framework is the first secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework that identifies and detects security threats while considering uncertainty issues in IoT networks and having more flexibility in decision-making and accepting transactions in the blockchain layer. Evaluation results verify the efficiency of the blockchain layer in throughput and latency metrics and the intelligent fuzzy layer in performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score) in threat detection on both blockchain and IoT network sides. Additionally, FCS demonstrates that we obtain an effective system (stable model) for threat detection in blockchain-based IoT networks.}

This paper is designed in two folds; first, a generic blockchain-based online dispute resolution platform is tested with two litigation cases collected in 1999 and 2009 to show the need for a construction-focused system. Then, a new construction-specific framework, Decentralized Construction Enabling Transparent Resolution (DCENTR), is proposed to address the unique nature of construction projects. Ultimately, it is shown that dispute likelihood can be minimized through reliable contract and payment execution, and if occurred, construction disputes can be resolved with higher transparency and dramatic savings in effort, time, and cost.}

In the field of molecular magnetism, the lanthanide–radical (Ln–Rad) method has become one of the most appealing tactics for introducing strong magnetic interactions and has spurred on the booming development of heterospin single-molecule magnets (SMMs). The article is a timely retrospect on the research progress of Ln–Rad heterospin systems and special attention is invested on low dimensional Ln–Rad compounds with SMM behavior, primarily concerning with nitrogen-based radicals, semiquinone and nitroxide radicals. Rational design, molecular structures, magnetic behaviors and magneto-structural correlations are highlighted. Meanwhile, particular attention is focused on the influence of exchange couplings on the dynamic magnetic properties, with the purpose of helping to guide the design of prospective radical-based Ln–SMMs.}

Therefore, the threshold of driving factors can be used as an indispensable means of identifying potential threats to ecosystems. How to carry out ecological risk early warnings based on these thresholds requires further study. In this study, a comprehensive ecological risk assessment model (CERA) was established by combining landscape ecological risk assessment (LERA) and regional ecological risk assessment (RERA). The response thresholds of naturally and anthropogenically driven factors to CERA were determined using the constraint line method and elasticity analysis. Based on these results, an ecological risk early warning model was constructed. The results showed the following: (1) LERA showed an increasing trend, whereas RERA decreased between 2000 and 2020. (2) CERA showed a decreasing trend, but with large fluctuations. The CERA level showed a high center and low surroundings. (3) The non-linear relationship between CERA and drivers showed that CERA was higher in regions with a Digital Elevation Model <212.214, slope <1.036, rainfall <570.149, Gross Domestic Product <1.115, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index <0.576, population <251.927, cropland density <0.341, building density <0.056, and water density <0.341. (4) The WJL area showed a high-level of ecological risk warning, with 44.69% (22,791 km2) at Level IV and 23.8% (12,184 km2) at Level V warnings. Particularly, Level V warnings dominated the potential space by 51%. Areas like Tongyu and Da'an, exceeding 50% of Level V, require urgent attention. This study has elucidated the critical thresholds of CERA under various factors and, based on these thresholds, develops an ecological risk-warning model. This model can directly interpret the reasons for high-level warnings and provides essential support for broad ecological management and restoration efforts.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Movement towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) can improve health services, risk factor management, and inequality in non-communicable diseases (NCD); conversely, prioritizing and monitoring NCD management can support pathways to UHC in resource-limited settings. We aimed to estimate trends in NCD management indicators in Vietnam from 2010, and projections to 2030 at national and sub-national levels; compute the probability of reaching UHC targets; and measure inequalities in NCD management indicators at demographic, geographic, and socio-economic levels.
Methods
We included data of 37,595 households from four nationally representative surveys from 2010. We selected and estimated the coverage of NCD health service and risk management indicators nationally and by six sub-national groups. Using Bayesian models, we provided trends and projections and calculated the probability of reaching UHC targets of 80% coverage by 2030. We estimated multiple inequality indices including the relative index of inequality, slope index of inequality, and concentration index of inequality, and provided an assessment of improvement in inequalities over the study period.
Findings
Nationally, all indicators showed a low probability of achieving 2030 targets except sufficient use of fruit and vegetables (SUFV) and non-use of tobacco (NUT). We observed declining trends in national coverage of non-harmful use of alcohol (NHUA), sufficient physical activity (SPA), non-overweight (NOW), and treatment of diabetes (TOD). Except for SPA, no indicator showed the likelihood of achieving 2030 targets at any regional level. Our model suggested a non-achievement of 2030 targets for all indicators in any wealth quintile and educational level, except for SUFV and NUT. There were diversities in tendency and magnitude of inequalities with widening gaps between genders (SPA, TOD), ethnic groups (SUFV), urban-rural areas (TOH), wealth quintiles, and educational levels (TOD, NUT, NHUA).
Interpretation
Our study suggested slow progress in NCD management at the national level and among key sub-populations in Vietnam, together with existing and increasing inequalities between genders, ethnicities, geographic areas, and socioeconomic groups. We emphasised the necessity of continuously improving the healthcare system and facilities, distributing resources between geographic areas, and simultaneously integrating economic, education, and gender intervention and programs.

A detailed literature analysis is conducted by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in a systematic approach using credible and reliable database systems such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Scopus to highlight current advancements in blockchain technology uses in electric energy systems particularly in DR, as well as future potential and existing problems. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part lists the important publications that have delved into the implementation of Blockchain in demand response. Trends of Blockchain applications in other electric energy system areas are detailed in the second section.

In line with previous studies, tokens and conventional stocks within the insurance market may show positive but low connectedness levels. Furthermore, our findings confirm a higher sensitivity of the insurance system at both tails of the distribution in comparison with the median (Q=0.50). As expected, dynamic connectedness measures change over time, intensifying at the extremes of the distribution. This finding is confirmed by the robustness test that consists of analyzing the RTD (Relative Tail Dependence) measure, as we reject the symmetric response, since its values are clearly different from zero in most of the sample period. These results are of interest to portfolio managers, as the findings will allow them to suggest adjustments to investment portfolios according to the evolution of the dynamic spillovers found.}

abstract = {Objectives
The role of social media in biomedical knowledge mining, including clinical, medical and healthcare informatics, prescription drug abuse epidemiology and drug pharmacology, has become increasingly significant in recent years. Social media offers opportunities for people to share opinions and experiences freely in online communities, which may contribute information beyond the knowledge of domain professionals. This paper describes the development of a novel semantic web platform called PREDOSE (PREscription Drug abuse Online Surveillance and Epidemiology), which is designed to facilitate the epidemiologic study of prescription (and related) drug abuse practices using social media. PREDOSE uses web forum posts and domain knowledge, modeled in a manually created Drug Abuse Ontology (DAO – pronounced dow), to facilitate the extraction of semantic information from User Generated Content (UGC), through combination of lexical, pattern-based and semantics-based techniques. In a previous study, PREDOSE was used to obtain the datasets from which new knowledge in drug abuse research was derived. Here, we report on various platform enhancements, including an updated DAO, new components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content analysis, trend detection and emerging patterns exploration, which enhance the capabilities of the PREDOSE platform. Given these enhancements, PREDOSE is now more equipped to impact drug abuse research by alleviating traditional labor-intensive content analysis tasks.
Methods
Using custom web crawlers that scrape UGC from publicly available web forums, PREDOSE first automates the collection of web-based social media content for subsequent semantic annotation. The annotation scheme is modeled in the DAO, and includes domain specific knowledge such as prescription (and related) drugs, methods of preparation, side effects, and routes of administration. The DAO is also used to help recognize three types of data, namely: (1) entities, (2) relationships and (3) triples. PREDOSE then uses a combination of lexical and semantic-based techniques to extract entities and relationships from the scraped content, and a top-down approach for triple extraction that uses patterns expressed in the DAO. In addition, PREDOSE uses publicly available lexicons to identify initial sentiment expressions in text, and then a probabilistic optimization algorithm (from related research) to extract the final sentiment expressions. Together, these techniques enable the capture of fine-grained semantic information, which facilitate search, trend analysis and overall content analysis using social media on prescription drug abuse. Moreover, extracted data are also made available to domain experts for the creation of training and test sets for use in evaluation and refinements in information extraction techniques.
Results
A recent evaluation of the information extraction techniques applied in the PREDOSE platform indicates 85% precision and 72% recall in entity identification, on a manually created gold standard dataset. In another study, PREDOSE achieved 36% precision in relationship identification and 33% precision in triple extraction, through manual evaluation by domain experts. Given the complexity of the relationship and triple extraction tasks and the abstruse nature of social media texts, we interpret these as favorable initial results. Extracted semantic information is currently in use in an online discovery support system, by prescription drug abuse researchers at the Center for Interventions, Treatment and Addictions Research (CITAR) at Wright State University.
Conclusion
A comprehensive platform for entity, relationship, triple and sentiment extraction from such abstruse texts has never been developed for drug abuse research. PREDOSE has already demonstrated the importance of mining social media by providing data from which new findings in drug abuse research were uncovered. Given the recent platform enhancements, including the refined DAO, components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content, trend and emerging pattern analysis, it is expected that PREDOSE will play a significant role in advancing drug abuse epidemiology in future.}

However, IoT devices have limited resources available in terms of battery power, processing capacity, memory, bandwidth, etc. In an attempt to provide connectivity and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) support to IoT devices, the IPv6 routing protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) was officially launched as the standard routing protocol for IoT in 2012. Despite being reputed and used in diverse applications, several recent studies have revealed RPL's drawbacks and limitations. The main objective of this work is to help the IoT research community understand all aspects of RPL. The paper also provides a detailed description of the operation of the RPL protocol. What is more, this work includes novel and thorough examples, thereby gaining practical knowledge of the pros and cons of this protocol. In addition, this paper reviews and summarizes relevant RPL-based protocols and conducts comprehensive comparisons among them from the perspectives of reliability, robustness, energy efficiency, and flexibility. Technically speaking, after studying and reviewing the majority of the proposed RPL solutions, we are ultimately capable, in this work, of highlighting all the challenges faced by IoT researchers while enhancing RPL and providing what is expected to be dealt with professionally. The present work also gives more details about RPL simulation platforms and RPL applications. Not only to this extent, but rather the historical bibliometric analysis of RPL, which shows the trends in the area of research to be focused on, has been professionally analyzed based on RPL challenges over the years 2010 through 2021. To this end, the conclusions and recommendations of this study are presented along with the effective directions for future RPL, and their applicability. As a result, the authors believe that this work will be a valuable reference for all RPL researchers and designers.}

In the near future, sensitive, rapid and economical detection of food allergens will remain a hardship to the health promotion of the community. Biogenic Amines (BAs) are a type of food allergens, and due to the trace level and complexity of BAs, improvement of professional and cost-effective detection techniques has become particularly demanding. Since vegetables, canned and fresh fish, beverages, and fermented foods have high concentrations of BAs and are mainly consumed, the advancement of specific and finely tuned methods for quick diagnosis of BAs are exceedingly urgent.
Scope and approach
In this review, enzyme-based biosensors for BAs detection in foods with different transducers such as chemiluminescent, surface-enhanced raman scattering biosensors electrochemical, and fluorescence biosensors are presented. Nanozymes-based detection of BAs in foods are also discussed with recent applications. Moreover, the latest advances of BAs detection by enzyme-based biosensors and nanozyme-based methods are further tabulated.
Key findings and conclusion
Among modern diagnostic techniques, biosensors are economical, simple, and precise instruments for BAs detection. In the future, studying novel biosensors such as multifunctional nanocomposite biosensors will satisfy the demand for the enhancement of food safety and cost-effective nanozyme-based methods for BAs detection.}

Background
To assess the reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) service coverage in Vietnam with trends in 2000−2014, projections and probability of achieving targets in 2030 at national and sub-national levels; and to analyze the socioeconomic, regional and urban-rural inequalities in RMNCH service indicators.
Methods
We used national population-based datasets of 44,624 households in Vietnam from 2000 to 2014. We applied Bayesian regression models to estimate the trends in and projections of RMNCH indicators and the probabilities of achieving the 2030 targets. Using the relative index, slope index, and concentration index of inequality, we examined the patterns and trends in RMNCH coverage inequality.
Findings
We projected that 9 out of 17 health service indicators (53%) would likely achieve the 2030 targets at the national level, including at least one and four ANC visits, BCG immunization, access to improved water and adequate sanitation, institutional delivery, skilled birth attendance, care-seeking for pneumonia, and ARI treatment. We observed very low coverages and zero chance of achieving the 2030 targets at national and sub-national levels in early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, family planning needs satisfied, and oral rehydration therapy. The most deprived households living in rural areas and the Northwest, Northeast, North Central, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta regions would not reach the 80% immunization coverage of DPT3, Polio3, Measles and full immunization. We found socioeconomic, regional, and urban-rural inequalities in all RMNCH indicators in 2014 and no change in inequalities over 15 years in the lowest-coverage indicators.
Interpretation
Vietnam has made substantial progress toward UHC. By improving the government's health system reform efforts, re-allocating resources focusing on people in the most impoverished rural regions, and restructuring and enhancing current health programs, Vietnam can achieve the UHC targets and other health-related SDGs.

FinTech has proven its true potential in traditional financial offerings by delivering digital financial services to individuals worldwide. The pandemic has accelerated how people interact with financial services and has resulted in long-term changes to societies and economies. FinTech has expanded access to financial services and has made such changes possible. FinTech or Financial Technology refers to using new technologies for financial services. Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and cloud computing are a few technologies currently being applied to FinTech. In this paper, we consider FinTech, which partly uses blockchain technology. Blockchain technology plays a vital role in the financial sector as it ultimately lifts trust and the need for third-party verification by using consensus-based verification. This survey provides a comprehensive summary of the most relevant blockchain-based FinTech implementations and an overview of FinTech sectors and segments. For each segment, we provide a critique and a discussion on how each blockchain implementation contributes to solving the majority of problems faced by FinTech companies and researchers. This research aims to direct the future of financial solutions by providing an outline of the applications of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology (DLT) for FinTech. We discuss various implementations, limitations, and challenges of blockchain-based FinTech applications. We conclude this work by exploring possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and future research directions.}

abstract = {pH-sensitive surfactants find applications in many fields, including responsive drug delivery and smart material design. The rational design of the surfactant molecular structure leads to species presenting strong variations of the micellization parameter (e.g., critical micelle concentration, cmc, and aggregate dimension) in a controlled pH range. In the present work, the micellization of the branched amine oxide surfactant N,N-dimethyl-2-propylheptan-1-amine oxide (C10DAO-branched) is studied as a function of pH in dilute aqueous mixtures. Its behavior is compared with that of the linear isomer N,N-dimethyldecan-1-amine oxide (C10DAO-linear). The samples are investigated by potentiometric titrations, fluorescence spectroscopy, and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With increasing pH, micellized C10DAO-branched presents a higher tendency to remain in the protonated/cationic form with respect to the linear isomer. As a consequence, the minimum cmc value, observed when the protonated and the deprotonated/zwitterionic forms of the surfactant coexist in the micelles, is shifted to higher pH values. The volume of these C10DAO-branched “mixed micelles” is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of completely protonated or deprotonated aggregates. This is a singularity of the branched surfactant, not observed for the linear isomer. Overall, the results highlight that the branched molecular architecture of the surfactant tail, favoring the formation of low-curvature aggregates, enhances H-bonding between the protonated and deprotonated headgroups, which synergistically stabilizes the flatter surface of bulkier aggregates. Taking into account the good biodegradability of surfactants with a limited number of short side chains, purposely designed branched surfactants appear as a suitable option to accurately tune supramolecular aggregation in pH-responsive formulations.}

This study further demonstrates that expanding the variety of natural resource exploitation will amplify the negative effects of resource exploitation on environmental quality. Furthermore, the degree of environmental technology exerts a beneficial impact on environmental quality across various degrees of environmental quality. Our findings offer several insightful policies for natural resources management in the context of the ongoing industrial revolution.}

abstract = {Since the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, many alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) have been created that claim to be the currency of the future. There are now over 440 active altcoins in the market and new ones are being created each day. With every altcoin claiming to offer distinctive features, it is becoming increasingly difficult for investors to evaluate the potential of each altcoin. This chapter explores the various types of altcoins in the market and methods to evaluate their mid-term potential. The chapter will discuss a practical approach to rank the altcoins based on social network data and discuss the results from traditional econometric techniques to study the behavior of Bitcoin and altcoins.}
