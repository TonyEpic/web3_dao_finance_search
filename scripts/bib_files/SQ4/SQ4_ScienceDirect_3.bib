abstract = {Access to safe water is still a challenge. Millions of people worldwide, mainly in rural and remote regions, still do not have access to safe drinking water. Point-of-use and decentralized water treatment systems have the potential to improve their livelihood, especially if these technologies are combined with the advantages brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This paper presents and discusses opportunities for convergence between water treatment mainly using membrane separation processes and technologies related to Industry 4.0, focusing on a scenario of decentralized systems installed in developing countries. Emphasis is given to membrane-based applications due to their advantages of ease of operation, small area requirements, and reduced implementation time while maintaining a great capacity to produce high water quality regardless of raw water characteristics. Literature suggests that Industry 4.0 can be considered an ally to better support water management in remote and rural regions. Treatment units can now be integrated into digital cyber-physical systems to promote a greater comprehension of local necessities and provide transparent and effective communication, faster actions, or even remote and automatic operation, contributing to the capacitation of local operators and the performance and conservation of the infrastructure. It is also possible to monitor many parameters of water quality, ensuring process integrity and safe water. These advancements may result in affordable, adaptive, and resilient solutions, but it is necessary to consider the perspective of the Human Right to Water and Sanitation – unfortunately, not always present – and the difficulties inherent to developing countries.}

Nonetheless, human cognitive input still plays a critical role in the operation of process plants and replication of these cognitive capabilities remains a key challenge for advancing automation levels. In this paper, we provide an analysis of process and energy industries based on a scenario of reduced availability of skilled labour and increased demands for safety, sustainability, and resilience. We consider the different mechanical, sensing, situational awareness, and decision-making tasks involved in the operation of plants and map them to possible realisations of unmanned and autonomous systems. We discuss the implications of current technology capabilities and future technology development perspectives, the factors influencing the complexity of operation in process plants, and the importance of human-machine collaboration. As part of autonomous system capabilities, we consider adaptation as a key capability and we make a connection to adaptation of model-based solutions. We argue that reaching higher and wider levels of autonomy requires a rethink of the design processes for both the physical plants as well as the way automation, control, and safety solutions are conceptualised.}

This study examines alternative organizational forms for EDI processing within organizations and evaluates them on several task performance indices including independence, saturation, and satisfaction, and also relates them to EDI effectiveness as a function of information technology (IT) intensity and length of EDI use. Results from an extensive, two-phase survey of EDI users indicate that organizational form for EDI processing influenced task performance indices such that the more decentralized structures (i.e. star and circle structures) exhibited higher independence and lower saturation than the more centralized structures (i.e. wheel, kite, and chain structures). More decentralized forms also exhibited higher satisfaction with EDI than the more centralized forms on nonroutine EDI tasks. EDI task performance indices were also correlated with EDI effectiveness, such that higher independence, lower saturation, and higher satisfaction were associated with higher EDI effectiveness. IT intensity and length of EDI use also positively moderated the effects of decentralization on EDI effectiveness. These results are discussed in terms of the organizational implications of this strategic IT resource: EDI.}

Establishing an efficient "human-AI team" requires an organization and its members to have superior digital capabilities and develop effective capability improvement strategies to realize the organizational socialization process of AI. In this paper, we adopt the Design Research (DR) approach in building a Human-AI Collaboration Platform (HACP) in a work team, integrating AI teammates based on HACP, and optimizing the platform and human-AI collaboration. Considering organizational digital capabilities as one of the core components, we propose a three-level framework of digitalization capabilities for individuals, organizations, and across organizations, as well as the enhancement strategies of such capabilities. Besides, we clarify the foundation of digitalization capabilities and design, implement, and verify the enhancement strategies. The construction and successful implementation of the HACP in our study verify the effectiveness of the proposed capability framework and provide principle guidance for organizations to implement effective strategies to improve digital capabilities to facilitate the organizational socialization of AI teammates.}

As cities are the locus of the majority of global energy use, attention is increasingly being directed toward what can be done to improve the sustainability of urban energy systems. One solution receiving attention involves the increased use of decentralized energy supply resources, which reduce the distance between the point where usable energy is created and where it is ultimately consumed. This chapter examines these technologies in light of the limitations and challenges posed by the existing electric grid and the promise of the much-touted ‘smart grid’. The chapter presents a broader view of the urban energy system than is typically discussed, highlighting the role that shared thermal systems and electric ‘microgrids’ can play in providing a bridge toward a lower-carbon future.}

While traditional governance approaches tend to favor hierarchical structures with concentrated authority, the growing demand for increased stakeholder engagement and empowerment has spurred the emergence of innovative governance models. This article examines traditional and evolving governance approaches in major United States professional sports leagues—the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), and National Hockey League (NHL). Through a review of literature and governance documents, the traditional hierarchal models of the NFL and MLB are analyzed. Their incremental shifts toward more inclusive structures are also explored. In contrast, the NBA's adoption of a franchise model with decentralized authority and the NHL's establishment of a Players' Association are examined as examples of governance innovation. The impacts of these evolving approaches are considered in the context of league operations, labor relations, and overall stakeholder interest representation. This paper shows insights into the dynamics of governance change and the factors influencing shifts toward more collaborative and empowering structures within professional sports organizations.}

A wide range of literature has studied FL technical considerations, frameworks, and limitations with several works presenting a survey of the prominent literature on FL. However, prior surveys have focused on technical considerations and challenges of FL, and there has been a limitation in more recent work that presents a comprehensive overview of the status and future trends of FL in applications and markets. In this survey, we introduce the basic fundamentals of FL, describing its underlying technologies, architectures, system challenges, and privacy-preserving methods. More importantly, the contribution of this work is in scoping a wide variety of FL current applications and future trends in technology and markets today. We present a classification and clustering of literature progress in FL in application to technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, blockchain, Natural Language Processing, autonomous vehicles, and resource allocation, as well as in application to market use cases in domains of Data Science, healthcare, education, and industry. We discuss future open directions and challenges in FL within recommendation engines, autonomous vehicles, IoT, battery management, privacy, fairness, personalization, and the role of FL for governments and public sectors. By presenting a comprehensive review of the status and prospects of FL, this work serves as a reference point for researchers and practitioners to explore FL applications under a wide range of domains.}

This paper analyses health system responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in eight countries representative of SHI systems in Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Switzerland). Data collection and analysis builds on the methodology and content in the COVID-19 Health System Response Monitor (HSRM) up to November 2020. We find that SHI funds were, in general, neither foreseen as major stakeholders in crisis management, nor were they represented in crisis management teams. Further, responsibilities in some countries shifted from SHI funds to federal governments. The overall organisation and governance of SHI systems shaped how countries responded to the challenges of the pandemic. For instance, coordinated ambulatory care often helped avoid overburdening hospitals. Decentralisation among local authorities may however represent challenges with the coordination of policies, i.e. coordination costs. At the same time, bottom-up self-organisation of ambulatory care providers is supported by decentralised structures. Providers also increasingly used teleconsultations, which may remain part of standard practice. It is recommended to involve SHI funds actively in crisis management and in preparing for future crisis to increase health system resilience.}

This setup leads to an imbalance in the balance of payment, an increase of debt and budget asphyxia, whereas renewable resources are widely and abundantly available. The objective of this paper is to carry out a feasibility analysis of off-grid stand-alone renewable technology generation system for some remote rural areas in one Sahelian country. A survey conducted in 2006, within the framework of microgrids project, in rural areas located in three different regions in Senegal (Thies, Kaolack and Fatick) permits determination of demand estimations. Two reference technologies are chosen, namely a solar photovoltaic (PV) system of 130 Wc for solar endowment and a wind turbine of 150 W for wind speed. Taking into account the life-cycle-cost and the environmental externalities costs, our results show that the levelized electricity costs of PV technology are lower than the cost of energy from the grid extension for all these three regions. Thus, decentralized PV technologies are cost-competitive in comparison to a grid extension for these remote rural areas. For wind technology viabilities results are attained with a requirement demand lower than 7. 47 KWh/year for Thies and 7.884 KWh/year for the two remaining areas, namely Kaolack and Fatick. The additional advantage of the proposed methodology is that it allows the environmental valuation of energy generated from non-renewable resource.}

abstract = {This study explores the prospects of decentralisation and consensus building within the context of local economic development in Turkey. The broad theoretical concern of this research is the tension between the centre and periphery in the governance structure of Turkey. Over 80 interviews from three rapidly growing medium-sized cities, Denizli, Gaziantep and Kayseri, indicate that considerable decentralisation in recent decades has enabled municipalities and local groups to formulate and realise local projects. However, detailed case studies from Kayseri illustrate both the importance of kinship and social ties in forming alliances and identifying priorities in local politics. Charismatic individuals play a crucial role in initiating and driving local projects. The experience of Kayseri in local economic development through local initiatives demonstrates the current battles among different civic groups, numerous economic interests, and the national party agendas of political leaders. The study concludes that decentralisation has to be considered together with enhancing participatory democracy in governance at the local and national levels in Turkey. This transformation can only be achieved with a strong and credible state. The importance of a strong and credible state is even greater in the absence of a supranational body like the European Union within which localities can co-operate and interact. Perhaps more importantly, in the wake of unpredictable distortions imposed on localities by the globalisation of economic and financial activities, localities need a safeguarding national and/or supra-national mechanism in governance as well as in policy design.}

Gene drives also raise complex biosafety challenges and face scrutiny due to an allegedly-outsized involvement of certain philanthropic- and military funders. Against this background, this text is the first to develop a systematic account of the organizational structure that underpins global gene drive research. Applying social network analysis to data on co-authorship and research funding, I show that global gene drive research has limited organizational and geographical diversity and is firmly dominated by elite US-based organizations, with organizations from developing countries either playing marginal roles or being excluded altogether. Additionally, a preliminary analysis of financial transfers suggests that an overwhelming share of global research funding passes from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Imperial College London; and from the US National Institutes of Health to various first- and second-tier US research universities. Overall, the organizational structure implies a considerable legitimacy deficit in global scientific collaboration on a controversial novel biotechnology with significant biosafety risks yet potentially transformative impacts on key challenges of sustainable development.}

This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions.

To combat the ever-evolving threats, adopting advanced models like cybersecurity mesh is necessary to enhance our protection. Cybersecurity mesh is an architecture scalable, flexible, composable, robust and resilient and allows the interoperability and coordination between intelligent systems to provide security services. Designing a cybersecurity mesh faces three major challenges: scalability, distributed or federated systems, and technology integration. For the design, it is necessary to apply security tools that support scalability because millions and millions of data are stored, processed, and analysed. Federated systems are needed to improve interoperability in a decentralized cybersecurity mesh. However, it can be tough to integrate different security tools and communication protocols. Cryptographic algorithms and AI models like federated learning, swarming intelligence and blockchain technologies are useful for security services. It is essential to study the integration of existing methods to determine the best technology for the job. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of intelligent systems, including federated learning, blockchain technology, and swarming intelligence, with a particular focus on how they have been and can be used to enhance cybersecurity. We examine the latest trends in these technologies, explore their connections, and weigh the pros and cons of each approach.

abstract = {As the application of Blockchain Technology (BCT) grows across several industries, its inherent decentralized and immutable nature raises some conflicting issues concerning privacy regulation. The enforcement of privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies these challenges, as certain stringent privacy requirements within GDPR may conflict with BCT's features. However, little attention is given to such critical issues. This study draws on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theoretical lens as a mechanism to unfold the issue. The current research focuses on exploring the tensions and the opportunities for synergy through the lens of TOE to prevent privacy regulatory compliance failure. We analyzed 71 multidisciplinary research studies that highlight the areas of friction and present a unifying structure for research synthesis. In response to the identified areas of friction and potential opportunities for coexistence, we formulate nine research propositions centered around six prominent and contentious data privacy and protection requirements within the GDPR. This research contributes to the broader discourse on privacy regulatory-compliant blockchain-based solutions by providing a theoretical foundation for future investigation into this critical area. The study suggests that reconciling BCT and privacy regulation requirements will unlock BCT's full potential, creating a secure, privacy-conscious technology infrastructure and offering practical implications and insights for policymakers.}

In such context, we look at this sector as an organizational field whose future we question in the light of social (in the habits of access and use of knowledge), technological and relational changes, and raising the following question: “how is the organizational field of libraries reconfiguring internationally and externally in 2030? ". We conduct a prospective study to look ahead to the expected evolution of libraries and the role they could continue to play to support education, culture, and economy (in 2030). We use the Delphi method in three steps (data collection, formulation of an initial set of projections from discussions with experts, interviews and focus-groups). We propose four scenarios, two of which are considered trend scenarios, extensions of current trends in which libraries are adapting to a changing environment. Our results show that, despite significant consequences, COVID-19 did not change the course of these two scenarios. The two other projections are seen as “disruptive” scenarios: one anticipates the marginalization of libraries, the other the breakdown of the library concept itself. We finally offer contributions to the organizational field literature.}

Biological systems can exhibit intelligent swarm behavior through relatively independent individual, local interaction and decentralized decision-making. A major research challenge of self-organized swarm intelligence is the coupling influences between individual behaviors. Existing methods optimize the behavior of multiple individuals simultaneously from a global perspective. However, these methods lack in-depth inspiration from swarm behaviors in nature, so they are short of flexibly adapting to real multi-robot online decision-making tasks. To overcome such limits, this paper proposes a self-organized collision avoidance model for real drones incorporating a bio-inspired reward-modulated spiking neural network (RSNN). The local interaction and autonomous learning of a single individual leads to the emergence of swarm intelligence. We validated the proposed model on swarm collision avoidance tasks (a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles without central control) in a bounded space, carrying out simulation and real-world experiments. Compared with artificial neural network-based online learning methods, our proposed method exhibits superior performance and better stability.}

Another is the attempt to transfer administrative responsibility without clear and concomitant fiscal authority. Lessons to be drawn from the Venezuelan experience include: (1) vague and general top-down decentralization initiatives should be avoided; (2) education finance issues are crucial and must be addressed; and (3) issues involving unions and workers' benefits can represent major barriers to implementation.

abstract = {The numerous obstacles to large-scale integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and the mitigating steps that need to be taken to overcome them in smart grid technology implementation are extensively discussed in this review article. Main focus is given on the control techniques in Microgrids, different supporting measures such as electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (ESSs), and the monitoring techniques of Microgrid considering large scale renewable energy integration. The absence of physical factors like reactive power and frequency makes the DC microgrid less difficult than the AC microgrid. A comparison of the characteristics of centralized, decentralized, and distributed control arrangements reveals that the microgrid central controller (MGCC) bears the majority of the computational load and the cost of computation in centralized control, whereas local controllers (LCs) bear the least of the load and the cost of computation in completely decentralized control. Centralized and decentralized control also have less difficult implementations than distributed control, which has more complexity. Due to a number of challenges that are discussed in this article, the EV scenario in Bangladesh is rather challenging. The transportation sector has chosen vehicle to grid (V2G) approaches over other technologies due to a number of its advantages. In the event that a home energy storage system and an emergency backup storage system are required, V2G can reduce the cost of EVs and be modified for the local community. An autonomous power generation and distribution system is the main emphasis of a smart micro grid in this age, and internet of things (IoT) is utilized in various applications, such as micro grids, intelligent buildings, and intelligent control devices, for monitoring and tracking crucial data. Based on the topics that are presented in this article, it clearly demonstrates the state-of-the-art research in the area in question.}

The design of an appropriate framework has far-reaching implications for the manufacturing organization as a whole. Yet, to date, there has been no unified guidance on key PPC design issues. This is strongly needed, as it has been argued that novel information processing technologies – as part of Industry 4.0 – result in PPC frameworks with decentral structures. This conflicts with traditional works arguing for hierarchical or central structures. Therefore, we review the PPC design literature to create a comprehensive overview and summarize design proposals. Based on our review, we come to the intermediate conclusion that PPC frameworks continue to have a hierarchical structure, although decision-making is shifted more to decentral levels compared to traditional hierarchies. Our analysis suggests that the effect of a decentralization shift has potentially strong and poorly understood implications, both from a decision-making and organizational perspective.}

It is often built on decentralized data where edge nodes use the internet of everything to mitigate the malicious attacks. The server gives incentive to all the participants according to their individual contributions. For profit maximization, each participating node balances between training rewards and costs. Game theory (GT) is a mathematical optimization technique that can be used to solve problems in wireless communication including security, resource allocation, power management, node rewards and punishments, and balancing numerous trade-offs. The complicated interactions between the server and the edge devices are interpreted using GT to maximize their utility. In this review article, we present an overview of the latest research on GT-based FL models for profit maximization, authentication, privacy management, trust management, and threat detection. This study also investigates the bibliometric analysis covering the period from 2019 to 2022 with an emphasis on various mechanisms of FL for GT applications. This article seeks to fill the gap by exploring the significant works highlighting the authors, citations, algorithms used, findings, and applications in this field. Based on the findings, we conclude this article with several key challenges and future approaches for researchers to implement an efficient GT-based FL model.}

Systems theories seems to offer solutions for these challenges, but there has been little research on how rail organisations can establish processes and build resilience during periods of significant change that are complementary with this type of theoretical approach. This paper investigated senior business leaders’ perspectives of how systems thinking is, or could be, applied in organisational design, system change and risk management. Twenty-five interviews were carried out with senior executives and managers in the railway industry. These interviews were designed to explore the perceptions of these people in policy setting and senior management roles and what they see as barriers to change within a dynamic, fast moving, industry. This included exploring both the ‘work as imagined’ in the corporate strategy and company procedures, as well as their understanding of ‘work as done’. Two national change programmes that affect the frontline rail engineering workforce have been used as contexts to frame consultations within this study. The results identify some important points to consider for the design of change in a complex industry, and how a socio-technical system framework or model might be applied in practice.}

By creating secure and transparent platforms for tracking and verifying students' academic achievements, blockchain technology can help to create a more accessible and trustworthy education system, making it easier for students to showcase their skills and knowledge to potential employers. While the potential benefits of blockchain in education are significant, there are also several challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of this technology in the educational sector. Some of the major challenges include adoption, technical knowledge, interoperability, regulation, cost, data privacy and security, scalability, and accessibility. The necessary equipment for the implementation of blockchain technology in education is diverse and critical to the success of this innovative technology. Organizations should carefully consider this equipment when planning their implementation of blockchain technology in education to ensure the efficient and secure transfer of educational data and transactions within the blockchain network. Blockchain technology has the potential to play a significant role in promoting sustainability education and advancing the sustainability goals of both individuals and organizations. Organizations should consider incorporating blockchain technology into their sustainability education programs, in order to enhance the transparency, verifiability, and efficiency of their sustainability-related activities. While the use of blockchain technology in education is still in its early stages, the available data suggest that it has significant potential to transform the education sector and improve the efficiency and transparency of educational systems.}

Supply, demand, transmission, capacity and other technological constraints are thereby enforced. The transmission network, on which the scenario analyses are carried out, includes 30 bus, 41 lines, 9 generators, and 21 power users.

Drawing on organizational institutional theory, the paper explores organizational responses to deal with institutional complexity on a transnational pipeline project spanning China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The findings show how conflicting institutional demands across the involved countries were dealt with through the establishment of distinct organizational strategies and structures when a large Chinese petroleum organization entered into two separate project companies, each responsible for a section of the pipeline. One relied on a manipulation strategy where institutional complexity was reconciled by selectively coupling to certain institutional demands. The other handled competing demands through a compromise strategy involving the creation of a compartmentalized organizational structure. While these results confirm findings from prior work that the nature and internal representation of demands exerted on an organization shape its response strategy, we contribute further by showing how distinct contextual characteristics of megaprojects influence the specific responses adopted to deal with institutional complexity.}

abstract = {India's unique geographical diversity and status as the world's most populous nation make it exceptionally susceptible to a wide array of hazards, both natural and human-induced. This vulnerability is further compounded by the intersection of diverse disasters and the dense population, leading to significant human and material losses. In response to these challenges, effective emergency preparedness plans are indispensable, requiring meticulous risk assessments, strategic resource allocation, capacity building initiatives, and active engagement of community-oriented organizations. Continuous monitoring and adaptation are essential for bolstering resilience and safeguarding socio-economic stability. Furthermore, the examination of developmental and disaster-specific organizations' roles in preparedness and response necessitates a systematic shift towards proactive paradigms, fostering an anticipatory culture rather than a reactive one. This study aims to dissect the intricate web of organizational efforts crucial for emergency preparedness in Varanasi, one of the world's oldest cities. By delving into these critical mechanisms, our goal is to enhance collective readiness against potential emergencies, safeguarding the city's rich heritage and its inhabitants. Through a mixed-method approach, this research illuminates the multifaceted involvement of organizations across various sectors, unraveling a complex tapestry of challenges that impede practical disaster preparedness. We scrutinize the coordination among governmental and non-governmental entities, funding dynamics, and grassroots alliances, revealing untapped resources for disaster resilience. Additionally, we analyze the strategies adopted by the national emergency preparedness and response force, highlighting both successes and shortcomings. Moreover, this study underscores the unique competencies of individuals involved in disaster preparedness, while identifying structural and functional gaps within organizational frameworks. Conversely, non-profit organizations face distinct challenges, including fundraising constraints and donor-imposed limitations, hindering their ability to develop comprehensive emergency preparedness and response capacities compared to public and private entities. In summary, this research serves as a comprehensive exploration of organizational dynamics in emergency preparedness within Varanasi, offering valuable insights into the complexities of disaster management efforts. By addressing these challenges, we aim to pave the way for more effective and inclusive disaster preparedness strategies, ultimately enhancing the resilience of Varanasi and similar communities globally.}

However, DFL faces incentive and security challenges in the decentralized framework. To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.}

In this paper, we provide an analysis of blockchain governance through a case study of the first cryptocurrency to adopt on-chain voting, Dash. Our analysis introduces the key characteristics of blockchain governance, steps through a data-driven exploration of Dash's on-chain voting system, and highlights exploitable attack vectors and vulnerabilities for the subversion of Dash's on-chain voting system via a novel network analysis methodology. We then conclude with guidelines for other organizations looking to implement similar blockchain governance solutions while maintaining integrity in their operations.}

Decentralized AI, safe data sharing (for model training), and data privacy protection have all become priorities in recent years, thanks in part to the use of peer-to-peer distributed systems such as blockchains. As a result, we comprehensively examine how blockchain and AI may benefit from the usage of cyber security in this study. AI must be used in cyber security. AI is required in cyber security protection to counter assaults and blockchains. The essential technology underlying the well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin is blockchain. A blockchain is a public ledger that is accessible to all users and is not administered by a single company. It is a technology that allows individuals and companies to interact openly and honestly.

Four different models of decentralisation, deconcentration (administrative), devolution (political), corporatisation (functional) and privatisation (non-government), have been used to describe and analyse these changes. There is expected to be a major devolution of powers to area health boards from central government, reversing the centralising tendencies which have occurred over the past century. Within boards a pluralistic system of service management, incorporating the above models of decentralisation, is being implemented to replace the present system of institutional administration and to give greater decision-making responsibility to health professionals, nongovernment agencies and community groups. These initiatives are associated with population-based funding of hospital boards complemented by service planning guidelines. Of particular importance has been the recent government decision to place the funding and management of primary health care under area health boards. However, there are serious concerns as to whether such radical changes, which could put New Zealand ahead of the rest of the world in achieving an integrated health system, can be implemented given the management expertise needed.}

It investigates the ways in which the diverse entities that comprise a GO can be co-ordinated and integrated to achieve a global unity of effort, while leaving space for local adaptation, differentiation and flexibility. The business literature on GOs highlights several tensions that characterise processes of integration: vertical vs. lateral relations; standardization vs. differentiation of practices; centralization vs. decentralization of decision making. Interpreting PMS as a series of practices that carry organisational knowledge and rationales across organisations, the paper relies on the case of Nestlé Waters to study how PMS can be used to manage the tensions involved in integrating GOs. On the one hand, PMS can be used to re-shape existing boundaries by supporting the development of new organisational arrangements, where standardization and centralization around shared strategies are achieved. On the other hand, PMS can become trapped by the contradictory forces emanating from multiple centres of decision making. Importantly, when attempting to bind together distant entities in the same “organisational space”, informal control mechanisms may become relevant, but they have the capacity to both reinforce and damage the potential of PMS in managing the tensions involved in integrating GOs.}

This is particularly true in the area of environmental policy which is often associated with public participation, government accountability and responsiveness, environmental stewardship, and the accrual of local policy capacity for environmental protection. Most of the operating assumptions on the relationship between democratic governance and environmental decentralization are drawn from mature democracies, however, not from those emerging from authoritarianism. This study compares the institutional, fiscal, and political experiences of two recently democratized countries, Hungary and Mexico, to ascertain whether democratic transition has been associated with the accrual of local environmental policy capacity. Our findings show that democratic transition is favorably associated with the decentralization of environmental policy responsibility but that many impediments to local capacity accrual remain. Democratization should be treated as a necessary but insufficient condition for developing local policy capacity for environmental protection in countries newly emerging from authoritarian rule.}

However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platform’s potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.}

The average and the peak load of the village are around 8 kW and 16.5 kW respectively. The feasibility of using locally produced biogas to drive a backup engine in comparison to using a diesel engine as backup has been explored through a techno-economic analysis using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables). This hybrid system has also been compared with a single diesel based power system. The results show that the hybrid system integrated with the biogas engine as backup can be a better solution than using a diesel engine as backup. The share of power generation by PV, wind and biogas are 49%, 19% and 32%, respectively. The LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) of generated electricity by this hybrid system ($0.25/kWh) is about 20% cheaper than that with a diesel engine as backup ($0.31/kWh), while the capital cost and the total NPC (Net Present Cost) are about 30% and 18% lower, respectively. Regarding CO2 emissions, using a biogas engine as backup saves 17 tons of CO2 per year compared to using the diesel engine as backup.}

Using a novel application of resource dependence theory, this paper applies stochastic actor-based model to examine how firms' informal authority is established and evolves to achieve their strategic goals within the Third Generational Partnership Project (3GPP), the primary global mobile telecommunications standard-setting organization. By using a comprehensive dataset of interfirm collaboration over the 3G and 4G generations, our analysis shows that firms tend to establish mutual dependencies by selecting collaborators who possess social capital (high reputations), but avoid collaborators with political capital (high status) within the interorganizational collaboration network. This research provides new insights into how meta-organizations are internally organized through informal authority, while also extending resource dependence theory to the network-level. It also advances our understanding of the formation of mutual dependencies from an actor-based perspective in an interorganizational collaboration network.}

However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet. The experimental results show that our scheme can more securely solve the problem of excessive privacy leakage of medical users within a feasible timeframe.}

The presence of centralized and decentralized systems and the continuous change in the market scenario has led to a transition of production systems from highly centralized or decentralized processes to a hybrid architecture that incorporated advantages of the production control approaches. The analysis of the production performances of recent semi-heterarchical architectures encourage to assess these architectures by introducing new scheduling approach that overcome the risk to take a myopic perspective: the long-sighted approach. To this aim, two new dispatching rules are proposed, both evaluated with different variability. This is significant because it allows the measurement of the performance of the production system, as well as the definition of the reactive and proactive capacity of semi-heterarchical architectures in an increasingly competitive market.}

Paramount importance is given to microgrids (MGs), while both of its modes (isolated and grid connected) are analyzed to examine the features of economic dispatch and system's net revenue in our prototypic. To deal with uncertainty in the demand curves, an innovative approach is adopted for the classification of electric load, according to their physical characteristics and user preferences. Furthermore, electricity generation is predominantly dependent on renewable energy sources (RESs), facilitated with the energy storage systems (ESSs); optimal scheduling methodology for power is introduced to tackle its intrinsically stochastic nature. Our problem minimizes the power system's aggregated cost with respect to power generation, consumption, and worst case transaction costs. Subgradient method is applied to solve our optimization problem, while lagrangian dual decomposition is used to transform the problem into subproblem for the accomplishment of all the objectives in distributed manners.

The resilience of physical infrastructure impacts the availability of emergency resources, while asymmetric resource dependence among emergency cooperation organizations influences the effectiveness of the coordinated emergency response. This study has formulated differential game encompassing three emergency response models: autonomous participation, government-led, and collaborative response. These models have been designed to account for scenarios involving infrastructure damage and asymmetric resource dependence scenarios to compute the optimal level of emergency response efforts by both government and social organizations, the government cost-sharing ratio, the optimal level of emergency resource availability, and disaster response performance. The results indicated that, under specific conditions, government cost-sharing can motivate social organizations to actively engage in disaster response, leading to improvement in disaster response performance. The collaborative emergency response model outperformed the other models regarding optimal emergency response strategy and disaster response performance. Notably, infrastructure damage and asymmetric resource dependence lead to a reduction in the optimal level of emergency response efforts and system disaster response performance for both parties. Furthermore, the impact of infrastructure damage on disaster response performance and the optimization of emergency resource availability levels are shown to be more substantial than the effects of asymmetric resource dependence.

abstract = {This study evaluates the interplay between decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) within the realm of inclusive banking by examining their foundational components, namely, alternative finance industry, distributed ledger platforms, and future payment technologies. The alternative finance industry leverages innovative technologies, such as direct lending, crowdfunding, automated wealth management, on-demand insurance, and digital currencies. This feature aligns well with the DeFi principles, and it is also beneficial to CeFi. Distributed ledger platforms offer transparency and security for both DeFi and CeFi, whereas future payment technologies provide user-friendly solutions. This study applies novel wavelet and quantile cross-spectral coherence analyses to obtain nuanced relationship insights. This methodology categorizes crypto finance into the DeFi and broader cryptocurrency ecosystems to facilitate robust comparison with traditional banking. It further delineates democratized banking into alternative financing mechanisms, distributed ledger technologies, and future payment capabilities. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals time–frequency associations, whereas quantile cross-spectral coherence unveils extreme connections under different market conditions. The findings suggest the existence of dynamic relationships between inclusive banking components and various financial infrastructures. These relationships vary across return distributions and time scales. In regular markets, positive associations are seen in yearly and monthly frequency cycles with alternative finance and centralized services exhibiting the strongest linkage. During periods of extremely high returns, CeFi and centralized-decentralized (hybrid) infrastructures exhibit limited interconnectivity with democratized banking. Moreover, DeFi's association with distributed ledger technology is negligible. In bear markets, the strongest positive associations are observed between inclusive access and conventional, hybrid, and decentralized financial systems. These insights provide new perspectives on the dynamics between financial systems during extreme conditions. This study emphasizes the need for adaptive regulation, international cooperation, and a balance between innovation and stability to protect and empower users. Collaboration between academia and policymakers is essential to navigate this evolving landscape and advance democratized banking.}

In this paper, we outline the most critical obstacles to decentralization and examine a strategy to reduce their significance.

Those who used these vehicles thought of transferring control from the human to autonomous driving systems to solve their safety and comfort problems. Today, instead of fully autonomous systems targeted for the future, autonomous driving support systems have been developed. Although these systems aim to increase the safety and comfort of passengers, they can become an easy target for malicious people due to network technologies and remote connection features. The most effective method of protection from these attackers is to conduct vulnerability analysis against newly emerging threats for the systems we use and to rectify identified vulnerabilities. In this research paper, the weaknesses of wireless communication towards remote connection usage of the mini electric autonomous vehicle were investigated, which we developed and produced its mechanics, electronics, and software. In this context, a test environment was created, and the problems and threats in autonomous driving technology were revealed through attacks (Deauth Attack, DoS, DDoS and MitM) made on the test environment. Following the exposed vulnerabilities, studies were conducted for the detection of these attacks using Artificial Intelligence.

To date, there have been numerous academic research conducted regarding AVs, and many attempts have been made to summarize these research documents by manually reviewing them. Nevertheless, due to the vast nature of the existing literature, it is challenging to synthesize the themes in AV-related research and to explore their trends to inform future research direction. This study aims to utilize an advanced natural language processing technique to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in AV-related research. The abstracts of 3292 articles published in transportation-based journals from January 2016 to October 2022 were collected and used for this study. A Structural Topic Model (STM) was employed to explore the dominant research themes hidden in the extant literature on AV research, examine their evolution over time, and determine the topics highly associated with developing and developed economies. Overall, the study highlighted that the least common themes in the literature are in the areas of the development of complex vehicle designs, safety, environmental benefits, and the impact of AVs on transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, themes concerning AV safety and the environment are emerging as hot topics since late 2021. Topics related to investigating user perceptions, policies/approaches to increase user demand, and AV control/stability are highly studied. Besides, they predominantly originated from developed countries. The research themes, their associated trends, and the key policy suggestions drawn from the study are potentially useful for making well-informed research funding decisions, setting research priorities for countries, and guiding the future research endeavours of researchers.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
Technological innovations in agriculture are mainly driven by the maxim: increase productivity at any costs. Today, in the face of climate change and an unprecedented loss of biodiversity, this approach is reaching its limits. Meeting global nutrition needs while achieving sustainability is one of the greatest challenges for modern agriculture.
OBJECTIVE
Autonomous field management represents the next evolutionary step in agricultural technology. It is characterized by an end-to-end automation of agricultural production processes and by that – for the first time in history - independence from labor constraints. Although literature has provided solutions for individual components of these new technological systems, integrating those components into a common, fully autonomous process has not yet been achieved.
METHODS
We analyzed the technological, agronomic, environmental, and related, interdisciplinary literature in the context of automated, and digital field crop management.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The review shows the disruptive potential of fully autonomous, labor-independent crop management systems to guarantee the required food security by simultaneously allowing sustainable factors to be equally incorporated into the agricultural decision-making process. The integration of multifaceted objectives into a common decision-making process poses a great challenge to human farmers and their capacities. Liberated from labor constraints, autonomous systems have the potential to align decisions with the complex requirements of multiple − even contradicting – goals more easily, and to execute them accordingly without exhaustion. We show barriers that explain, why fully autonomous crop management is not yet present in today's agricultural practice, despite the fact that the majority of technological sub-components has reached a maturity stage beyond the proof of concept. Substantial technological progress will still be required with respect to the robustness in varying application settings and the standardization of interfaces to integrate diverse subsystems. For the adoption of autonomous cropping systems, societal engagement will be required including extensive research and discussion on public acceptance, legal frameworks, and the human farmers' future role as crucial success factors.
SIGNIFICANCE
Aligning autonomous cropping systems to domain-overarching objectives can make these technological solutions not only another, next stage of more efficiently producing technologies, but a game changer for new, environmentally sustainable cropping systems. Field management practice can leave the currently persisting, oversimplified management strategies, characterized by large-scale, and standardized field arrangements, toward more complex approaches with small-scale, diversely structured fields, which consider local particularities and the heterogeneity of the natural landscape.}

This paper focuses on the multi-autonomous-satellite coordination and scheduling problem which is formulated by a novel mathematical model based on the multi-agent system (MAS). To solve the problem, we firstly analyze general organizational structures for the MAS and propose a new dynamic-distributed organizational structure. For these different structures, an improved contract network protocol (ICNP) and a blackboard model (BM) negotiation mechanism are proposed to coordinate the satellites. Then, an online single-satellite scheduling algorithm is proposed to schedule the tasks. In the experiments, we build up a multi-satellite system to analyze the performance of different autonomous coordination mechanisms. Experimental results indicate that the ICNP mechanism can increase the total revenue and reduce the inter-satellite communication cost. In scenarios where satellites could break down randomly, the BM can reduce the revenue losses and the number of task failures efficiently, which proves the good performance of the proposed methods in terms of robustness. The proposed methods have important practicality in the real application of the multi-autonomous-satellite system.}

In response to the problems associated with centralized authorities (e.g. single point of failure, limited scalability, lack of user control), new identity management models have emerged, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which relies on verifiable data registers to validate Decentralized Identifier (DIDs) and can be achieved in many different ways, e.g. through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), distributed databases or other decentralized systems. The main goal of SSI is to enable users to take control of managing their data shared with different services. In this paper, we examine a possible application of the SSI concept to aerial base station (ABS)- integrated networks. The paper presents the effective use of DID implementation to provide a secure and decentralized way to create, associate and verify credentials and identities of ABSs, ensuring secure communication between Ground Base stations (GBSs) and other nodes in the network in a multi-operator scenario. In the numerical results, the average values of various metrics (namely, the average credential presentation time, the average credential offer time, the average DIDcomm connection creation time, the average DIDcomm signing time, and the average DIDcomm revoke credential time) related to credential operations in a DID management system are given for three different number of requests (50 K, 75 K, and 100 K). We have also provided the values of the different status codes that occurred in 100 K operations in the same DID management system. Towards the end of the paper, a comparison is made between SSI-based and Non-fungible token (NFT)-based blockchain solutions, also discussing the challenges and future directions of SSI solutions in the context of ABS-integrated networks.}

The complexity of these systems increases with the demand of more customized and quality products, which requires more agile and flexible methods to support the dynamic and on-the-fly system reconfiguration aiming to respond quickly to product changes, by offering more efficient services. In this service-oriented manufacturing context, where process functionalities are modelled as services (e.g., quality control, welding and transportation), the dynamic reconfiguration of the services structure (e.g., in terms of quality, processing time and provided features) assumes a critical role to achieve the referred requirements. Despite the current research efforts, the service reconfiguration approaches usually use reactive event triggers, with decisions coming from a centralized decision-maker and performed manually. This means a lack of dynamic and run-time reconfiguration flexibility by discovering opportunities and needs to change, and, thus, exploring possible actions leading to new and appropriate system configurations. To overcome the mentioned issues, it is essential to provide solutions that answer to when and how to reconfigure a manufacturing system in an integrated, automatic and dynamic manner. For this purpose, this paper introduces an agent-based approach for service reconfiguration in manufacturing systems that allows the identification of opportunities in a pro-active and dynamic manner, and the on-the-fly implementation of new configuration solutions leading to a better production efficiency. The experimental results, using a flexible manufacturing system case study, allowed to verify the feasibility and benefits of the proposed agent-based service reconfiguration solution for competitive and collaborative industrial automation scenarios.}

abstract = {Purpose
To improve school organisational performance and innovativeness, and meet diverse student needs, school leaders should be innovative, risk-takers and proactive, thus applying entrepreneurial practices/strategies and market mechanisms. This study aims to investigate, from a schoolteacher's perspective, the degree of entrepreneurial leadership behaviour (ELB) applied by school principals in European primary schools. Given that school autonomy is perceived as an important predictor of leaders' entrepreneurship, this study investigates the impact of educational macro (autonomy and accountability) and micro (demographics) contexts on ELB by comparing centralised and decentralised European school systems with the highly centralised Greek school system.
Design/methodology/approach
This comparative study was conducted in Greece (630 participants) and in 14 European countries (972 participants). Thornberry's Entrepreneurial Leadership Questionnaire was used, comprising general entrepreneurial leader (GEL), miner (MIN), accelerator (ACC), explorer (EXP) and integrator (INT) behaviours.
Findings
The results revealed that ELB is a multi-dimensional concept, and that all participating teachers perceived ELB application moderately, with more focus on the internal (than external) school environment. Furthermore, the dual-directional macro-contextual influence found in applying ELB indicates that high school autonomy and accountability activate ELB owing to the school's freedom to engage in entrepreneurial ventures, while low autonomy/accountability still activates ELB, but only for organisational survival within hierarchical-bureaucratic school environments. This feature differentiates “intrapreneur/intrepreneur” from “entrepreneur” school principals.
Originality/value
The theoretical basis of entrepreneurial leadership (EL) in education should include entrepreneurial multi-dimensional leadership aspects (competencies, behaviours, skills) and educational context (macro and micro). Implications for school leadership research and practice are also discussed.}

Autonomous IoT (AIoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices that operate without human intervention, making decisions and performing tasks autonomously. Traditional methods of provisioning IoT devices, such as manual configuration and over-the-air updates, are error-prone and insecure. The emergence of eSIMs (embedded SIMs) provides a viable solution for secure and flexible identity management in IoT devices. This work implements a low-cost, zero-touch remote provisioning system using GSMA standard Over-The-Air (OTA) IoT-SAFE protocol. This research predicts that future IoT devices will be eSIM-enabled, which are simple to configure, provision, validate profiles, and check security policies remotely. IoT onboarding processes are designed where blockchains are used to verify immutable repositories to store this network manifests, verifiable by Ethereum smart contracts. The integrated framework combines blockchain contracts, eSIM-based remote SIM provisioning through IoT-SAFE protocol, and SDN to manage IoT ecosystems' security. The proposed solution is evaluated using simulations and security analysis, and it demonstrates its feasibility at scale and resilience to attacks even under insecure environments. When compared with the baseline IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, our SDN-based Remote-SIM provisioning system (SIeSIM) reduces overhead to about 240 ms Time-To-Provision (TTP), outperforming manual provisioning by nearly 320 % and 210 % compared to expert provisioning in terms of TTP performances, respectively.}

This paper explores why post-reform decentralization in China has failed to bring about environmental sustainability, using a case study from Uxin banner in Inner Mongolia. The local government has promoted intensive grassland improvement in its political, economic, and environmental policies under the umbrella of “ecological construction,” a term used to describe the enhancement of vegetation cover on this arid terrain. The government’s aggressive approach to ecological construction, however, is incongruent with the ecology of the Inner Mongolian drylands. Consequently, although beneficial to short-term economic growth, “ecological construction” has led to unintended grassland degradation, thus undermining environmental sustainability.}

These systems should provide mechanisms that contribute to flexibility and facilitate adaptation to changes in the environment. In this paper, we present two self-organization mechanisms for a decentralized service discovery system in order to improve its performance. These mechanisms are based on local actions of agents that only consider local information about queries they forward during the discovery process. The self-organization actions are chosen by each agent individually when the agent considers them to be appropriate. The actions are: remaining in the system, leaving the system, cloning, and changing structural relations with other agents. We have evaluated each self-organization mechanism separately but also the combination of the two as the environmental conditions in the service demand change. The results show that the proposed self-organization mechanisms considerably improve the performance of the service discovery system.}

It finds that most interventions are economically motivated, and that three key factors are needed for local governments to be good resource managers: capacity, incentive and long-term commitment. These three factors are part of a process in which civil society can play a critical role.}

However, applying common agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and Lean to cultivate these capabilities inevitably introduces feedback ambiguity, which can paralyze decision-making and increase errors due to inherent human cognitive limitations. To address this, tailored carbon-zero feedback algorithms are proposed to complement human judgment in agile workflows. Specifically, prescriptive analytics, federated learning, and probabilistic programming are injected into Scrum, Kanban, and Lean respectively to restore clarity amidst ambiguity. The framework is grounded in cases from the textile industry to demonstrate applicability in practical settings. By targeting the roots of distortions with human-algorithm collaborations, it provides an actionable roadmap to implement carbon-zero agility.}

In this paper, we apply this analytical framework to twelve energy co-operatives in Spain. These collectively owned organizations are energy-marketing communities, and they have specific objectives: These are an ecological objective (to reduce energy consumption and generate renewable energy) and a social objective (to propose an alternative to the reality of the energy market and citizen empowerment). Energy co-operatives in Spain have been typified as social enterprises, and these social enterprises have experience in common energy service, with which they may mark their future role in local energy communities. These results show the consolidation of energy co-operatives as a sign of the maturity of Spanish society in the face of energy challenges.}

Since the decentralized energy generation (DEG) covers a broad range of technologies, including many renewable energy technologies (RET) that provide small-scale power at sites close to the users, this concept could be of interest for these locations. This paper identifies the areas in Croatia where such systems could be applied. Consideration is given to geographical locations as well as possible applications. Wind, hydro, solar photovoltaic, geothermal, and biomass conversion systems were analyzed from a technological and economic point of view. Since the renewable energy sources (RES) data for Croatia are rather scarce, the intention was to give a survey of the present situation and an estimate of future potential for DEG based on RES. The energy potential (given as capacity and energy capability) and production costs were calculated on a regional basis and per type of RET. Finally, the RES cost–supply curves for 2006 and 2010 are given.}

abstract = {One of the foremost challenges confronting society today is the vulnerability of critical physical infrastructures in urban areas to extreme events. The major challenge in these scenarios despite the availability of the means of communication (e.g. ad-hoc networks, hand held devices) is the lack of trust among the first responders due to their having no prior experience of interactions amongst themselves. Also the spreading of inaccurate or misleading information can have disastrous consequences in the chaotic and hazardous environments which are prevalent in large-scale disasters. Therefore it is imperative that the responders possess the ability to assess and evaluate the trustworthiness as well as the information propagated by fellow responders in order to facilitate collaboration. This paper presents a decentralized trust model to enhance reliable information dissemination in large-scale disasters. The model proposed includes a distributed recommendation scheme, incorporated into an existing membership maintenance service for ad-hoc networks. In addition it has a nature-inspired activation spreading mechanism that allows trust-based information propagation. Search and Rescue exercises involving civil engineers and firefighters were conducted at the Illinois Fire Service Institute (IFSI) to test the software. The upshot of the simulation was immediate and robust establishment of trust and high resilience to the spread of the unreliable information.}

This can involve a much more profound involvement in original product development, or inputs into programmes of pre-competitive (basic or applied) research to support the longer term evolution of the core technology of the MNE group. It is suggested that this evolution of decentralised labs' positioning in MNE knowledge strategies implies (i) an increasing involvement in product development rather than adaptation, (ii) an interdependent rather than dependent position in group technology programmes, (iii) increased relevance of supply side influences (host country technology competencies, capacities and heritage), (iv) decline of centralising forces on R&D (e.g., economies of scale, communication and co-ordination problems, concerns of knowledge security).}

Given the high-volume and pervasive nature of these attacks, it is beneficial for stakeholders to collaborate in detecting and mitigating the denial of service attacks promptly. Blockchain technology is considered to improve the security aspects owing to the decentralized design, secured distributed storage, and privacy. A thorough exploration and classification of blockchain techniques used for DDoS attack mitigation are not explored in the prior art. This paper reviews and categorizes state-of-the-art DDoS mitigation solutions based on blockchain technology. The DDoS mitigation techniques are classified based on the solution deployment location i.e. network-based, near attacker location, near victim location, and hybrid solutions in the network architecture with emphasis on the IoT and SDN architectures. Additionally, based on our study, the research challenges and future directions to implement the blockchain based DDoS mitigation solutions are discussed.}

It is influenced as well by the degree of democratization nationally and locally. Decentralization is measured by both institutional indices indicating greater devolution of power to local governments and the share of local governments in national government consumption. Empirically, the paper finds that decentralization changes in ways predicted, in particular it increases with economic growth, country size, and population. Institutional structures based on colonial experience and initial constitutional provisions also matter.}

Based on the dynamic capabilities view, the literature on organizational context, supply chain agility, and innovation, we develop our hypotheses. We investigate the previously overlooked impact of supply chain agility on innovation performance, as we find that supply chain agility not only helps to prevent and repair short-term damage but also promotes innovation in the long term. We also consider the moderating role of the organization’s complementarity with its key suppliers in this relationship. Structural equation modeling is applied to investigate the proposed research hypotheses using lagged survey data with multiple respondents from the manufacturing sector in Pakistan.}

The algorithm combines random channel selection with variable signal intensity to minimise the probability of collisions at the receiver's end, yet relies exclusively on locally available information.

The main challenges are keeping the microgrid safe, reliable, economical and under full control. A lot of references regarding control and energy management of microgrids are published, and there is a constant need to stop, and review what has been suggested so far in this area. This paper offers an extensive literature review of microgrid control through several points of view. Control system architecture can be organized as centralized or decentralized structure, the main features of both of them are different and there are positive and negative sides of both architectures. In decentralized architecture, there are different levels of decentralization, mostly regarding the level of communication between system elements. Hierarchical structure is widely used im microgrids, where control functions are mapped to hierarchical levels. Islanding detection as a part of primary control level, microgrid clusters, a relatively new concept in organizing microgrid control, differences between the control of grid connected microgrid and islanded microgrid, as well as standalone microgrids are also reviewed in this paper stating research trends and gaps. This article offers microgrid control related topics in need of more research and possible future research interest in the area.}

However, existing safety information systems provide self-owned, isolated, and centralized environments and fail to present a secure, transparent, and trustworthy platform for monitoring and management of accident information. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel decentralized blockchain-based system for accident/incident information management of construction projects. The proposed system leverages the benefits and advantages of blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized IPFS storage to address the security transparency, tampering, and trustworthiness issues of the conventional approaches. The proposed system is simulated by using real-world construction accident data to demonstrate how blockchain technology can provide a novel solution to assure security, transparency, authenticity, availability, and immutability of the accident/incident data for improving safety management.}

Fiscal decentralization is on the rise worldwide while barriers to factor and population mobility are declining. Greater decentralized government activity is therefore taking place in an economic environment characterized by increased competition for mobile resources, and government policy within this environment is increasingly cognizant of profound implications this combination of decentralization and mobility may have on political and economic outcomes. As these trends have become important, the academic literature across several disciplines in economics has paid increasing attention to the issues that arise from these trends. This chapter summarizes the progress that has been made in this literature – in both theoretical and empirical dimensions – while simultaneously pointing out some open questions for future research. Several important themes emerge: First, while simple versions of more general models have clarified many analytic issues, policy trade-offs are ultimately made in complicated settings rich with institutional detail. Thus, the search for a greater connection between theoretical models and data has taken on particular importance. Complex general equilibrium models of fiscal decentralization ultimately become most useful when underlying parameters within such models are determined by the data. Both calibration and structural estimation techniques are advancing this portion of the literature. Second, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on political forces in debates over fiscal decentralization. Not only does such decentralization carry with it potential economic benefits and costs, but political decisions are likely to be fundamentally different in a decentralized environment. Important further work on political institutions under fiscal decentralization is needed. Finally, as decentralization has been studied in multiple contexts, it has become increasingly clear that the micro-foundations of local goods and services need further theoretical and empirical investigations. Many such goods (such as crime prevention and schooling) depend on peer and neighborhood effects, and predictions can change fundamentally as such effects are introduced.}

Focusing on the transformation initiative in Istanbul's Derbent informal neighbourhood (gecekondu), where community-driven innovation emerged in the face of state-led urban development, this research elucidates the ways local collectives navigate and transform governance structures. The study presents three main lessons with broader implications for understanding urban governance dynamics globally: (1) the capacity of self-organized entities to re-politicize local networks and impact urban governance, even in authoritarian contexts; (2) the transformative power of these initiatives in facilitating a transition from entrepreneurial strategies to responsive governance tactics, adapting to the needs and inputs of local stakeholders; (3) the enrolment of self-organized groups in policy networks, highlighting the importance of collective platforms that bridge the gap between citizens and policymakers. This investigation into local self-governance strategies demonstrates the tangible impact of localized efforts in catalysing change in spatial governance, challenging traditional models. While rooted in a unique socio-political landscape, the findings transcend the specific context of Derbent, encouraging further investigation into similar urban dynamics worldwide. The research calls for a re-evaluation of entrepreneurial governance models to better accommodate and leverage grassroots participation and invites further comparative research on the applicability of these insights beyond the studied context.}

Over the last decade, this emerging orientation has gained new momentum with the development of new bioengineering tools, theories, and technologies. Despite the growing acceptance of buSynBio, few studies have dedicated attention to the analysis of its organizational aspects. This article offers the first systematic investigation of emerging research initiatives in buSynBio and their meaning to bioengineering research. Our analysis is based on a multi-method qualitative study, including expert literature review, bibliometric research and a documentary analysis of online materials such as reports and project descriptions available in official grant data repositories. Our study found that publications of specialized articles on “bottom-up synthetic biology” have increased, both in absolute numbers and normalized to total number of publications. We show how that might be enabled by novel mechanisms of organization that reposition material, intellectual and political resources in synthetic biology. Drawing on theoretical analyses within Science and Technology Studies (STS), we examine 14 research initiatives in 5 selected countries (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Netherlands, and Switzerland). The bottom-up approach is supported by a variety of “tentative regimes” of scientific governance in different stages of consolidation, but holding in common the establishment of novel basic research in Chemistry, Biology, Engineering and Physics. The study aims to contribute to social science research in synthetic biology by shedding light on the implications of buSynBio as trend driving the current organizational change of bioengineering research.}

The main political parties that emerged responded by giving priority to the development of local and regional organizations and creating a wide network of grassroots movements. This led to a gradual introduction of more decentralized political institutions and a significant increase of expenses to prefectures and subsidies to municipalities. Building on two novel hand-collected datasets at the prefectural and municipal levels, our analysis provides empirical evidence of party favoritism in the spatial allocation of intergovernmental transfers during the first two decades of Metapolitefsi. We argue that governing parties diverted intergovernmental transfers towards their political strongholds and politically aligned mayors, as local authorities played the role of the focal points in the process of party building.}

To date, most of the (automated) solutions to this problem require a central authority to make decisions for all the trains in a given control area. An appealing alternative is to consider trains as intelligent agents able to self-organize and determine the best traffic management strategy. This could lead to more scalable and resilient approaches, that can also take into account the real-time mobility demand. In this paper, we formalize the concept of railway traffic self-organization and we present an original design that enables its real-world deployment. We detail the principles at the basis of the sub-processes brought forth by the trains in a decentralized way, explaining their sequence and interaction. Moreover, we propose a preliminary proof of concept based on a realistic setting representing traffic in a French control area. The results allow conjecturing that self-organizing railway traffic management may be a viable option, and foster further research in this direction.}

However, the notion of an AWS is not easily defined since its differentiating feature from a weapon is the autonomous system. This lends itself to a systems approach to making sense of what constitutes an AWS. This paper's aim is to examine how a systemic perspective can aid our understanding of an AWS. It is proposed that an AWS can be interpreted in terms of three pillars. Firstly is system, which, when viewed in terms of self-regulating systems, leads to the second pillar which is autonomy. Underpinning the functioning of these self-regulating systems is the third pillar, values, manifesting in their legal and moral considerations. The UK approach to AWS, revealed in a number of recent Ministry of defence documents is explored using the three pillars. This provides a rich insight into the complexity associated with AWS and the challenge of defining what constitutes the system, the nature of autonomy and how values govern their use, in particular legal compliance and ethical judgement. It is concluded that the three pillars offers a useful framework to make sense of the complexity of other forms of autonomous technological systems.}

The first contribution of this paper is a comprehensive review on market, regulatory and technological status to support the transition towards distributed cross-commodity energy management with focus on Germany and Finland. Markets disruption could lead to more decentralized structures. Mechanisms therefore have been proposed, but mostly without sector integration. Clean Energy Package includes legislation that is supportive towards cross-commodity energy sharing solutions. Corresponding implementation in Germany and Finland may be successful in both countries even though it differs. Regarding technology, the article identifies required technical components (IoT, AI and blockchain) focusing on their support decentralized and cross-sector energy systems. Key components of IoT are wireless communication and interoperability middleware. AI provides key technologies for modelling and optimization of sector-integrated and distributed energy systems. Even if there has been lots of research, practical implementations are still lacking. Furthermore, many technical challenges still exist for blockchain based solutions in decentralized energy systems. Moreover, organizational, and legal responsibilities need to be clarified to support the adoption of blockchains in decentralized energy systems. Finally, the article gives recommendations regarding an increasing implementation of cross-commodity sharing and how it can contribute to the energy transition.}

Traditional security measures often fail to address these concerns due to the unique characteristics of IoT networks, such as heterogeneity, scalability, and resource constraints. This survey paper adopts a thematic exploration approach for a comprehensive analysis to investigate the convergence of quantum computing, federated learning, and 6G wireless networks. This novel intersection is explored to significantly improve security and privacy within the IoT ecosystem. Quantum computing can enhance encryption algorithms to make IoT data more secure for intelligent IoT applications. Federated learning, a decentralized machine learning approach, allows IoT devices to learn a shared model while keeping all the training data on the original device, thereby enhancing privacy. This synergy becomes even more crucial when integrated with the high-speed, low-latency capabilities of 6G networks, which can facilitate real-time, secure data processing and communication among many IoT devices. Second, we discuss the latest developments, offering an up-to-date overview of advanced solutions, available datasets, and key performance metrics and summarizing the vital insights, challenges, and trends in securing IoT systems. Third, we design a conceptual framework for integrating quantum computing in federated learning, adapted for 6G networks. Finally, we highlight the future advancements in quantum technologies and 6G networks and summarize the implications for IoT security, paving the way for researchers and practitioners in the field of IoT security.}

The rapid PCB prototyping service providers are pursuing the mass individualization paradigm. Yet, these providers suffer from low efficiency and high cost in the large-scale small-batched mixed pilot production of rapid PCB prototyping. To improve the production efficiency in mass individualization of rapid PCB prototyping, this paper proposed a cloud-edge orchestration-based bi-level autonomous process control (CEO-BAPC) framework. A blockchained smart contracts-driven multi-agent system is established at the edge to realize efficient tasks coordination under disturbances. Based on the operation events data and control decisions collected at the edge, a customized deep learning-driven prediction model is established at the cloud for supporting the rescheduling decisions. The blockchained smart contracts (e.g., Stackelberg game solution) at the edge proactively decentralize short-term fine-grained individualized task execution among manufacturing units/machines and make the results available on upper-level deep learning model at the cloud for supporting holistic rescheduling decisions. The bi-level autonomous process control architecture avoids the inconsistency between holistic control and local execution under frequent random disturbances and thereby realizes efficient manufacturing of mass individualization. Through a simulated case based on data collected from a rapid PCB prototyping service provider in China, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed CEO-BAPC framework are verified.}
