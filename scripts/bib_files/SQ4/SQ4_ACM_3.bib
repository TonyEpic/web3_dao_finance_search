abstract = {Within the scope of the personnel organization, it should be clarified, which employees are to be responsible for what kind of maintenance tasks. The individual competence of an employee's abilities can be checked against the maintenance requirements using the well-known profile comparison. However, it is less clear how the corporate competence of a team of employees can be identified, but a suitable solution can be found using the personnel-oriented simulation. Regarding the organizational structure of the staff, maintenance tasks are often transferred to a central department. However, there is also a tendency to integrate them into the production area. In many cases this results in mixed organizational forms of central and decentralized maintenance. A novel product quality-oriented maintenance concept will be presented and simulated using the example of a mechanical workshop. In addition to a case-related planning solution, general statements on the department organization of maintenance are derived.},

abstract = {Society is characterized by the presence of a variety of social norms: collective patterns of sanctioning that can prevent miscoordination and free-riding. Inspired by this, we aim to construct learning dynamics where potentially beneficial social norms can emerge. Since social norms are underpinned by sanctioning, we introduce a training regime where agents can access all sanctioning events but learning is otherwise decentralized. This setting is technologically interesting because sanctioning events may be the only available public signal in decentralized multi-agent systems where reward or policy-sharing is infeasible or undesirable. To achieve collective action in this setting, we construct an agent architecture containing a classifier module that categorizes observed behaviors as approved or disapproved, and a motivation to punish in accord with the group. We show that social norms emerge in multi-agent systems containing this agent and investigate the conditions under which this helps them achieve socially beneficial outcomes.},

abstract = {In an active noise control ANC system, computational complexity is one major concern when designing practical control algorithms. For an ANC system with multiple secondary sources and error microphones, one approach to reducing computational complexity is to apply a decentralized control scheme rather than centralized approaches. A decentralized scheme attempts to control a number of small-size ANC subsystems independently. In this paper, we consider the decentralized control of a two-channel ANC system tackling a noise disturbance in the frequency domain, where each channel consists of one secondary source and one error microphone. We propose a decentralized control method that is able to achieve the same noise reduction performance as the centralized controller with guaranteed convergence. The key step in designing the control method is to properly shape the eigenvalues of a matrix that models the two-channel secondary paths for each frequency index.},

year = {2012},
publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {Our paper deals with the scheduling of complex assembly lines with a focus on Job Shop Scheduling Problems that exhibit several assembly specific characteristics: many isolated project networks with precedence constraints and thousands of jobs, time bound requirements for jobs and projects, limited resources with individual scheduling and resource lock rules. Formally it is defined as a Multi-Mode Resource-constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem with splitting activities. Problems that display these characteristics are often difficult to solve with classical scheduling approaches within acceptable runtime. Simulation-Based Optimization offers an auspicious manner of dealing with those domain specific problems. Using this approach we present a decentralized heuristic evident in self-organization in nature. Typical algorithms attempt to solve the above problems globally. In our solution, the jobs of the network take over the active role. They communicate with their neighbors and the allocated resources, each having the local goal to optimize their own situation.},

abstract = {Threshold signatures protect the signing key by sharing it among a group of signers so that an adversary must corrupt a threshold number of signers to be able to forge signatures. Existing threshold signatures with succinct signatures and constant verification times do not work if signers have different weights. Such weighted settings are seeing increasing importance in decentralized systems, especially in the Proof-of-Stake blockchains. This paper presents a new paradigm for threshold signatures for pairing and discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems. Our scheme has a compact verification key consisting of only 7 group elements, and a signature consisting of 8 group elements. Verifying the signature requires 8 exponentiations and 8 bilinear pairings. Our scheme supports arbitrary weight distributions among signers and arbitrary thresholds. It requires non-interactive preprocessing after a universal powers-of-tau setup. We prove the security of our scheme in the Algebraic Group Model and implement it using Golang. Our evaluation shows that our scheme achieves a comparable signature size and verification time to a standard (unweighted) threshold signature. Compared to existing multisignature schemes, our scheme has a much smaller public verification key.},

abstract = {Consider the following scenario: a spatio-temporal stochastic process generates service requests, localized at points in a bounded region on the plane; these service requests are fulfilled when one of a team of mobile agents visits the location of the request. For example, a service request may represent the detection of an event in a sensor network application, which needs to be investigated on site. Once a service request has been generated, it remains active for an amount of time which is itself a random variable, and then expires. The problem we investigate is the following: what is the minimum number of mobile agents needed to ensure that each service request is fulfilled before expiring, with probability at least 1 − ε? What strategy should they use to ensure this objective is attained? Formulating the probability of successfully servicing requests before expiration as a performance metric, we derive bounds on the minimum number of agents required to ensure a given performance level, and present decentralized motion coordination algorithms that approximate the optimal strategy.},

abstract = {Key management has long remained a difficult unsolved problem in the field of usable security. While password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) are widely used to solve this problem in centralized applications, their low entropy and lack of a recovery mechanism make them unsuitable for use in decentralized contexts. The multi-factor key derivation function (MFKDF) is a recently proposed cryptographic primitive that aims to address these deficiencies by incorporating commonly used authentication factors into the key derivation process. In this paper, we implement an MFKDF-based Ethereum wallet and perform a user study with 27 participants to directly compare its usability against traditional cryptocurrency wallet architectures. Our results show that MFKDF-based applications outperform conventional key management approaches on both subjective and objective metrics, with a 37\% higher average SUS score (p &lt; 0.0001) and 71\% faster task completion times (p &lt; 0.0001) for the MFKDF-based wallet.},

abstract = {To achieve an optimal outcome in many situations, agents need to choose distinct actions from one another. This is the case notably in many resource allocation problems, where a single resource can only be used by one agent at a time. How shall a designer of a multi-agent system program its identical agents to behave each in a different way?From a game theoretic perspective, such situations lead to undesirable Nash equilibria. For example consider a resource allocation game in that two players compete for an exclusive access to a single resource. It has three Nash equilibria. The two pure-strategy NE are efficient, but not fair. The one mixed-strategy NE is fair, but not efficient. Aumann's notion of correlated equilibrium fixes this problem: It assumes a correlation device that suggests each agent an action to take.However, such a "smart" coordination device might not be available. We propose using a randomly chosen, "stupid" integer coordination signal. "Smart" agents learn which action they should use for each value of the coordination signal.We present a multi-agent learning algorithm that converges in polynomial number of steps to a correlated equilibrium of a channel allocation game, a variant of the resource allocation game. We show that the agents learn to play for each coordination signal value a randomly chosen pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the game. Therefore, the outcome is an efficient correlated equilibrium. This CE becomes more fair as the number of the available coordination signal values increases.},

abstract = {Variants of the decentralized MDP model focus on problems exhibiting some special structure that makes them easier to solve in practice. Our work is concerned with two main issues. First, we propose a new model, Event-Driven Interaction with Complex Rewards, that addresses problems having structured transition and reward dependence. Our model captures a wider range of problems than existing structured models. In spite of its generality, the model still offers structure that can be leveraged by heuristics and solution algorithms. This is facilitated by explicitly representing interactions as first-class entities. We formulate and solve instances of our model as bilinear programs. Second, we look at making offline planning for communication tractable. To this end, we propose heuristics that limit problem size by making communication available only at a few strategically chosen points based on an analysis that exploits problem structure in the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate a reduction in problem size and solution time using restricted communication, with little or no decrease in solution quality. Our heuristics therefore allow us to solve problems that would otherwise be intractable.},

Over the past two decades, it has had a transformative impact on our society and has revolutionized almost all aspects of human interaction. Through the use of smartphones, personal tablets and increasing number of wireless-based sensors in our environments, wireless networking systems touch every aspect of human lives today. Nonetheless, with exponential spread of mobile wireless devices, continued improvements in spectrum utilization, resource allocation, hardware miniaturization, and development of new renewable energy sources, we find ourselves still very much in the infancy of the development of such networks, which have the potential to grow and become orders-of-magnitude more sophisticated.}

The added convenience brought by these devices spans across multiple facets of everyday life, such as drivers reporting an accident through dash cams, patients monitoring their own health, and companies controlling the safety of their facilities. However, it is critical to increase safety and privacy across the data generated and propagated by these devices. Previous works have focused mainly on device management and relied on centralized solutions namely Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This paper describes a novel mechanism that ensures secure autonomous communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, while using a completely decentralized solution that mitigates the classical single points-of-failure problem.

Prior studies have reported volunteer moderators' diverse roles in different governance models, highlighting the tensions between moderators and other stakeholders (e.g., administrative teams and users). Building upon prior research, this paper focuses on how volunteer moderators moderate racist content and how a platform's governance influences these practices. To understand how moderators deal with racist content, we conducted in-depth interviews with 13 moderators from city subreddits on Reddit. We found that moderators heavily relied on AutoMod to regulate racist content and racist user accounts. However, content that was crafted through covert racism and "color-blind'' racial frames was not addressed well. We attributed these challenges in moderating racist content to (1) moderators' concerns of power corruption, (2) arbitrary moderator team structures, and (3) evolving forms of covert racism. Our results demonstrate that decentralized governance on Reddit could not support local efforts to regulate color-blind racism. Finally, we discuss the conceptual and practical ways to disrupt color-blind moderation.},

abstract = {Sidelink relay, authorized as an independent work item in both 3GPP R17 and R18, is a promising technology for facilitating future V2X communication in 5G New Radio (NR). As specified by 3GPP, several important factors of NR sidelink, including flexible hop-by-hop operation mode selection, sidelink path loss based power control, and resource sharing with uplink communications, were partially (if not totally) ignored in available studies. In light of this, we propose a general multi-hop NR sidelink relay scheme, namely, NSR-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$(rho,omega,m)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, for flexible dissemination of a typical Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM). To efficiently characterize the multi-hop DENM dissemination process under NSR-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$(rho,omega,m)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, we further develop a stochastic geometry-based theoretical framework, by carefully taking into account the above 3GPP specified important factors. With the help of the theoretical framework, we are able to derive the end-to-end delivery probability and the total dissemination distance of a given DENM. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical framework. For a given DENM with a limited lifetime, it is also proved that the NSR-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$(rho,omega,m)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; scheme is of great potential in significantly expanding the achievable performance region, by properly tuning the parameters &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$rho $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$omega $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, and &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the benefits of cooperation and proposes a relay activation strategy for a large wireless network with multiple transmitters. In this framework, some nodes cooperate with a nearby node that acts as a relay, using the decode-and-forward protocol, and others use direct transmission. The network is modeled as an independently marked Poisson point process, and the source nodes may choose their relays from the set of inactive nodes. Although cooperation can potentially lead to significant improvements in the performance of a communication pair, relaying causes additional interference in the network, increasing the average noise that other nodes see. We investigate how source nodes should balance cooperation versus interference to obtain reliable transmissions, and for this purpose, we study and optimize a relay activation strategy with respect to the outage probability. Surprisingly, in the high reliability regime, the optimized strategy consists on the activation of all the relays or none at all, depending on network parameters. We provide a simple closed-form expression that indicates when the relays should be active, and we introduce closed-form expressions that quantify the performance gains of this scheme with respect to a network that only uses direct transmission.},

abstract = {The centralized nature of Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides the global view of the network topology at the SDN controller. Therefore, the controller should collect up-to-date information of network state, particularly its topology. Most of the current SDN controller platforms perform topology discovery using OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP) mechanism, which leverages (LLDP) the Link Layer Discovery Protocol. Unfortunately, the current topology discovery approach does not care about quality of service (QoS) information of underneath devices. But fortunately, QoS-aware topology discovery can be done with the same method, due to the structure of the LLDP packet. In this paper, we propose aggregated QoS-aware topology discovery mechanism, based on LLDP, over Decentralized Software Defined Wireless Mesh Network (D-SDWMN) architecture to collect and aggregate the topology and its corresponding QoS information, to support QoS-aware policies and decisions in SDN-based WMN. The experiment results present the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in term of QoS information collection with just slightly extra network traffic overhead, and without overall network traffic performance deteriorate.},

abstract = {This paper reports on progress to date in developing a computerized simulation - optimization model of the general management structure of a firm. This model called MANAGE, offers a framework wherein the profit performance of a company can be simulated and assessed under a variety of structural configurations. MANAGE also incorporates certain behavioral parameters that impact upon successful communication within corporate organizations. The paper describes the general framework of the model; the manner in which various structural, behavioral, and economic variables are incorporated into the model or can be set as desired by the user; and the nature of the outputs that are produced. The paper also describes the manner in which MANAGE generates profit solutions under various combinations of behavioral, heirarchical and economic conditions and compares them with traditional optimal economicsresults. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the potential applications of MANAGE.},

Our work investigates how AI could open new possibilities for supporting introspective experiences. Adopting a design fiction approach, we created a fictional company called Meta.Aware to contextualize 4 different Introspective AI product concepts in the form of video sketches. We used the Meta.Aware platform to conduct interviews with 17 participants, using the 4 concept videos as prompts for discussion. Participants had a range of reactions related to perceived benefits and tensions in this emerging design space. We interpret these results to outline future design directions for mobilizing AI as a resource to support introspective experiences over time, as well as to reflect on issues and dilemmas bound to this emerging design space.},

abstract = {In a large variety of applications, it is increasingly important to provide application functionality in a modular way by means of (Web) services. At the same time, pre-defined applications are no longer suitable to cope with the high functional dynamics that can be found in novel e-business, e-health, and e-science applications. In contrast, dynamic application creation, i.e., applications that are assembled ad hoc by service composition and usually instantiated very few times, are more and more becoming prevalent. Form a systems point of view, large scale application environments like the Internet create scalability requirements towards distributed execution of composite (Web) services which go beyond the traditional non-distributed approach to manage composite services.The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we present a novel approach that combines those aspects by using different technologies in a distributed environment to dynamically distribute composite service execution in situations where it is beneficial or required. Second, the approach considers semantic annotation of services to facilitate new possibilities for data and service co-ordination. Third, the approach also incorporates the interfaces needed to integrate service execution with semantic service composition planners to allow for dynamic forward failure recovery by contingency service re-planning. These concepts are currently developed on the basis of the peer-to-peer platform OSIRIS NEXT which supports dynamically distributed and decentralized execution of composite semantic services that are described based on OWL-S.},

abstract = {Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications.In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we evaluated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT), one of the trending and emerging fields in the world today, has sufficed the purpose of interconnection and interlinkage of devices and smart applications with extremely little hassle. Its success has led to an exponential rise in the integration of numerous technically and mechanistically sound methods and ideas with IoT in order to climb the ladder of evolving perspectives and successful developments. However, his too had a number of challenging phases which were to be hurdled over in a smart and fiscal manner. The need to accommodate the massive amount of distinct data being generated called for the efficacy of Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing was initialized in the 1960’s and gained popularity over the last decade. Unfortunately, Cloud Computing didn't prove to be the all-in-all solution to the consequences and weaknesses of IoT. Later, Cloud Computing evolved and improvised to a novel version of Fog/Edge Computing which is highly in demand among the new-fangled. Safety and security of the data reservoired is a conundrum for majority of the researchers and workers in this field. The tactical incorporation of Blockchain technology into that of Fog/Edge Computing would be one of the best solutions to prevent data breaches and other forms of intrusion attacks.},

abstract = {The Metaverse, positioned as the next frontier of the Internet, has the ambition to forge a virtual shared realm characterized by immersion, hyper-spatiotemporal dynamics, and self-sustainability. Recent technological strides in AI, Extended Reality, 6G, and blockchain propel the Metaverse closer to realization, gradually transforming it from science fiction into an imminent reality. Nevertheless, the extensive deployment of the Metaverse faces substantial obstacles, primarily stemming from its potential to infringe on privacy and be susceptible to security breaches, whether inherent in its underlying technologies or arising from the evolving digital landscape. Metaverse security provisioning is poised to confront various foundational challenges owing to its distinctive attributes, encompassing immersive realism, hyper-spatiotemporally, sustainability, and heterogeneity. This article undertakes a comprehensive study of the security and privacy challenges facing the Metaverse, leveraging machine learning models for this purpose. In particular, our focus centers on an innovative distributed Metaverse architecture characterized by interactions across 3D worlds. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough review of the existing cutting-edge measures designed for Metaverse systems while also delving into the discourse surrounding security and privacy threats. As we contemplate the future of Metaverse systems, we outline directions for open research pursuits in this evolving landscape.},

Rescue forces traditionally respond to such incidents with a paper-based triage system, but technical solutions can potentially achieve improved usability and data availability. We develop a triage management system based on commodity hardware and software components to verify this claim. We use a single-hop, ad-hoc network architecture with multi-master replication, a tablet-based device setup, and a mobile application for emergency services. We study our system in cooperation with regional emergency services and report on experiences from a field exercise. We show that state-of-the-art commodity technology provides the means necessary to implement a triage management system compatible with existing emergency service procedures, while introducing additional benefits. This work highlights that powerful real-world ad-hoc networking applications do not require unreasonable development effort, as existing tools from distributed systems, such as replicating NoSQL databases, can be used successfully.},

When engaging in high-stakes or complex transactions, they often choose browser-based wallets, leveraging third-party security extensions. For simpler transactions, they prefer the convenience of mobile wallets. Many participants avoid hardware wallets due to usability issues and security concerns with respect to key recovery service provided by manufacturer and phishing attacks. Social networks play a dual role: participants seek security advice from friends, but also express security concerns in soliciting this help. We offer novel insights into how and why users adopt specific wallets. We also discuss design recommendations for future wallet technologies based on our findings.},

The IIoT is becoming indispensable, providing the means through which modern communication is conducted across industries and offering improved efficiency, scalability, and robustness. However, the structural and dynamic complexity introduced by the continuous integration of the IIoT has widened the scope for cyber-threats, as the processes and data generated by this integration are susceptible and vulnerable to attacks.

The dimensions of this study are twofold: first, we present an overview of the cutting-edge security of IIoT ecosystems, and second, we survey the literature on digital forensics. The key achievements, open challenges, and future directions are identified in each case. The challenges and directions for future studies that we identify will provide important guidance for cybersecurity researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Federated Learning is a distributed, privacy-preserving machine learning model that is gaining more attention these days. Federated Learning has a vast number of applications in different fields. While being more popular, it also suffers some drawbacks like high communication costs, privacy concerns, and data management issues. In this survey, we define federated learning systems and analyse the system to ensure a smooth flow and to guide future research with the help of soft computing techniques. We undertake a complete review of aggregating federated learning systems with soft computing techniques. We also investigate the impacts of collaborating various nature-inspired techniques with federated learning to alleviate its flaws. Finally, this paper discusses the possible future developments of integrating federated learning and soft computing techniques.},

abstract = {The proliferation of observational devices and sensors with networking capabilities has led to growth in both the rates and sources of data that ultimately contribute to extreme-scale data volumes. Datasets generated in such settings are often multidimensional, with each dimension accounting for a feature of interest. We posit that efficient evaluation of queries over such datasets must account for both the distribution of data values and the patterns in the queries themselves. Configuring query evaluation by hand is infeasible given the data volumes, dimensionality, and the rates at which new data and queries arrive. In this paper, we describe our algorithm to autonomously improve query evaluations over voluminous, distributed datasets. Our approach autonomously tunes for the most dominant query patterns and distribution of values across a dimension. We evaluate our algorithm in the context of our system, Galileo, which is a hierarchical distributed hash table used for managing geospatial, time-series data. Our system strikes a balance between memory utilization, fast evaluations, and search space reductions. Empirical evaluations reported here are performed on a dataset that is multidimensional and comprises a billion files. The schemes described in this work are broadly applicable to any system that leverages distributed hash tables as a storage mechanism.},

abstract = {It is well known that users on open blockchains are tracked by an industry providing services to governments, law enforcement, secret services, and alike. While most blockchains do not protect their users' privacy and allow external observers to link transactions and addresses, a growing research interest attempts to design add-on privacy solutions to help users regain their privacy on non-private blockchains.In this work, we propose to our knowledge the first censorship resilient mixer, which can reward its users in a privacy-preserving manner for participating in the system. Increasing the anonymity set size, and diversity of users, is, as we believe, an important endeavor to raise a mixer's contributed privacy in practice. The paid-out rewards can take the form of governance tokens to decentralize the voting on system parameters, similar to how popular "Decentralized Finance (Defi) farming" protocols operate. Moreover, by leveraging existing Defi lending platforms, AMR is the first mixer design that allows participating clients to earn financial interest on their deposited funds.Our system AMR is autonomous as it does not rely on any external server or a third party. The evaluation of our AMR implementation shows that the system supports today on Ethereum anonymity set sizes beyond thousands of users, and a capacity of over 66,000 deposits per day, at constant system costs. We provide a formal specification of our zk-SNARK-based AMR system, a privacy and security analysis, implementation, and evaluation with both the MiMC and Poseidon hash functions.},

But how will 6G transform mobility and communication within a country facing the challenges of a rapidly aging population and the growing threat of natural disasters? We investigate how 6G-enabled technologies could shape social and economic values in Japan in the next decade. To accomplish this, our team has created frameworks informed by secondary research, workshops, and storytelling to develop scenarios for Japan in 2030 and beyond. This paper describes our design process, as well as how our methodologies generated four distinctive future scenarios where 6G technologies are actively used in the context of Japan. The speculative futures presented in this paper are intended to spark discussion about the implications of novel technologies and present ways in which design-led research can drive technological innovation forward.},

In this paper, we explore the role of topologies in autonomously coping with failures. The topologies we consider are based on regular, random, small-world, and power law graphs. Connections within these topologies can account for network proximity and are suitable for real-time communications. We explore specific attributes of a topology that contribute to its failure resiliency. The metrics that we use to profile this resilience include: communication path lengths, network partitions, migration of workloads, and the impact on system throughput. This research will allow designers to choose topologies or configure metrics for a specific topology to achieve their performance objectives.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing adoption has seen significant growth over the last five years. It offers a diverse range of scalable and redundant service deployment models, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS). These models are applied to areas such as IoT, Cyber-Physical Systems, Social Media, Data Science, Media Streaming, Ecommerce, and Health Informatics. The growth in cloud presents challenges for companies to source cloud expertise to support their business, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises with limited resources. The UK Government recently published the Digital Skills Crisis report, identifying skill-set challenges facing industry, with a shortage in cloud skills negatively impacting business. While cloud technologies have evolved at significant pace, the development of Computer Science curriculum in the further and higher education sector has lagged behind. The challenges faced in the sector includes the training of educators, institutional gaps (software and hardware policies), regulatory constraints, and access to cloud platforms. By embedding fundamental cloud skills throughout the educator and student journey, both stakeholders will be better positioned to understand and practically apply the use of appropriate cloud services, and produce graduates to support the needs of industry. This working group has carried out work to: i) assess current cloud computing curricula in CS and similar programs, ii) document industry needs for in-demand cloud skills, iii) identify issues and gaps around cloud curriculum uptake, and iv) develop solutions to meet the skill demands on core Cloud Computing topics, technical skills exercises, and modules for integration with contemporary Computer Science curricula.},

We define a set of key requirements for data operations in such middleware and motivate them with the application cases.This paper further discusses the current state and limitations of the browser as a platform for peer-to-peer communication and complex decentralized applications with shared data.

For this, we systematically examined the literature and, as a result, we discovered and summarized relevant architectural evaluation methods and associated modeling techniques and quality attributes, the maturity of these methods, as well as the benefits and costs of adopting them. We also address open issues and research opportunities and recommend that the mindset for SoS architecture evaluation must be changed to ensure the quality of SoS in critical domains.},

abstract = {Disk drives have experienced dramatic development to meet performance requirements since the IBM 1301 disk drive was announced in 1961. However, the performance gap between memory and disk drives has widened to 6 orders of magnitude and continues to widen by about 50\% per year. Furthermore, energy efficiency has become one of the most important challenges in designing disk drive storage systems. The architectural design of disk drives has reached a turning point which should allow their performance to advance further, while still maintaining high reliability and energy efficiency. This article explains how disk drives have evolved over five decades to meet challenging customer demands. First of all, it briefly introduces the development of disk drives, and deconstructs disk performance and power consumption. Secondly, it describes the design constraints and challenges that traditional disk drives are facing. Thirdly, it presents some innovative disk drive architectures discussed in the community. Fourthly, it introduces some new storage media types and the impacts they have on the architecture of the traditional disk drives. Finally, it discusses two important evolutions of disk drives: hybrid disk and solid state disk. The article highlights the challenges and opportunities facing these storage devices, and explores how we can expect them to affect storage systems.},
