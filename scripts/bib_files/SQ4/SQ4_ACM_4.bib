abstract = {With the end of Dennard scaling, power constraints have led to increasing compute specialization in the form of differently specialized accelerators integrated at various levels of the general-purpose system hierarchy. The result is that the most common general-purpose computing platform is now a heterogeneous mix of architectures even within a single die. Consequently, mapping application code regions into available execution engines has become a challenge due to different interfaces and increased software complexity. At the same time, the energy costs of data movement have become increasingly dominant relative to computation energy. This has inspired a move towards data-centric systems, where computation is brought to data, in contrast to traditional processing-centric models. However, enabling compute nearer memory entails its own challenges, including the interactions between distance-specialization and compute-specialization. The granularity of any offload to near(er) memory logic would impact the potential data transmission reduction, as smaller offloads will not be able to amortize the transmission costs of invocation and data return, while very large offloads can only be mapped onto logic that can support all of the necessary operations within kernel-scale codes, which exacerbates both area and power constraints. For better energy efficiency, each set of related operations should be mapped onto the execution engine that, among those capable of running the set of operations, best balances the data movement and the degree of compute specialization of that engine for this code. Further, this offload should proceed in a decentralized way that keeps both the data and control movement low for all transitions among engines and transmissions of operands and results. To enable such a decentralized offload model, we propose an architecture interface that enables a common offload model for accelerators across the memory hierarchy and a tool chain to automatically identify (in a distance-aware fashion) and map profitable code regions on specialized execution engines. We evaluate the proposed architecture for a wide range of workloads and show energy reduction compared to an energy-efficient in-order core. We also demonstrate better area efficiency compared to kernel-scale offloads.},

abstract = {In cloud computing, organizations can form cooperation to share the available resource to reduce the cost. This is referred to as the multi-organization cloud computing environment. In this paper, we address the issues of virtual machine management and cooperation formation in such an environment. First, for the cooperative organizations, an optimization model is formulated and solved for the optimal virtual machine allocation so that the total cost is minimized. Then, the cost management based on cooperative game theory is applied to obtain the fair share of the cost. Second, the cooperation formation among organizations is analyzed using the network game. With the dynamic cooperation formation, the stable cooperation structure is obtained. Both cooperative virtual machine management and cooperation formation are intertwined, in which the proposed optimization and game models can be used to obtain the solution of the rational organizations to minimize their own costs.},

abstract = {The increasing size of both deep learning models and training data necessitates the ability to scale out model training through pipeline-parallel training, which combines pipelined model parallelism and data parallelism. However, most of them assume an ideal homogeneous dedicated cluster. As for real cloud clusters, these approaches suffer from the intensive model synchronization overheads due to the dynamic environment heterogeneity. Such a huge challenge leaves the design in a dilemma: either the performance bottleneck of the central parameter server (PS) or severe performance degradation caused by stragglers for decentralized synchronization (like All-Reduce). This approach presents SDPipe, a new semi-decentralized framework to get the best of both worlds, achieving both high heterogeneity tolerance and convergence efficiency in pipeline-parallel training. To provide high performance, we decentralize the communication model synchronization, which accounts for the largest proportion of synchronization overhead. In contrast, we centralize the process of group scheduling, which is lightweight but needs a global view for better performance and convergence speed against heterogeneity. We show via a prototype implementation the significant advantage of SDPipe on performance and scalability, facing different environments.},

abstract = {Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model.},

abstract = {Traditional centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are sometimes unpractical in complicated applications due to non-interactivity between agents, the curse of dimensionality, and computation complexity. Hence, several decentralized MARL algorithms are motivated. However, existing decentralized methods only handle the fully cooperative setting where massive information needs to be transmitted in training. The block coordinate gradient descent scheme they used for successive independent actor and critic steps can simplify the calculation, but it causes serious bias. This paper proposes a exible fully decentralized actor-critic MARL framework, which can combine most of the actor-critic methods and handle large-scale general cooperative multi-agent settings. A primal-dual hybrid gradient descent type algorithm framework is designed to learn individual agents separately for decentralization. From the perspective of each agent, policy improvement and value evaluation are jointly optimized, which can stabilize multi-agent policy learning. Furthermore, the proposed framework can achieve scalability and stability for the large-scale environment. This framework also reduces information transmission by the parameter sharing mechanism and novel modeling-other-agents methods based on theory-of-mind and online supervised learning. Sufficient experiments in cooperative Multi-agent Particle Environment and StarCraft II show that the proposed decentralized MARL instantiation algorithms perform competitively against conventional centralized and decentralized methods.},

abstract = {In this work, we perform a comparative study of centralized and decentralized update strategies for the basic remote tracking problem of many distributed users/devices with randomly evolving states. Our goal is to reveal the impact of the fundamentally different tradeoffs that exist between information accuracy and communication cost under these two update paradigms. In one extreme, decentralized updates are triggered by distributed users/transmitters based on exact local state-information, but also at a higher cost due to the need for uncoordinated multi-user communication. In the other extreme, centralized updates are triggered by the common tracker/receiver based on estimated global state-information, but also at a lower cost due to the capability of coordinated multi-user communication. We use a generic superlinear function to model the communication cost with respect to the number of simultaneous updates for multiple sources. We characterize the conditions under which transmitter-driven decentralized update policies outperform their receiver-driven centralized counterparts for symmetric sources, and vice versa. Further, we extend the results to a scenario where system parameters are unknown and develop learning-based update policies that asymptotically achieve the minimum cost levels attained by the optimal policies.},

abstract = {User migration, i.e. the movement of large sets of users from one online social platform to another one, is one of the main phenomena occurring in modern online social networks and even involves the most recent alternative paradigms of online social networks, such as blockchain online social networks (BOSNs). In these platforms, user migration mainly occurs through hard forks of the supporting blockchain, i.e. a split of the original blockchain and the creation of an alternative blockchain, to which users may decide to migrate. However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

However, some dislocated areas are underprivileged in providing such services due to the lack, inefficiency, or excessive cost of Internet access. Opportunistic networking techniques might aid in surmounting these problems. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on an untrusted Data Mule to carry data from an offline source to an online destination. In particular, we present a framework that enables the communication between different actors and a reward mechanism using Distributed Ledger Technologies, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized File Storage. The protocol involved in bringing a Client’s message online and getting back a response is thoroughly explained in all its steps and then discussed on the most important trust and security issues. Finally, we evaluate such a protocol and the whole framework through a series of communication latency tests, an analysis of the Smart Contract usage, and simulations in which buses act as Data Mules. Our results suggest the feasibility of our proposal in a smart territory scenario.},

abstract = {The ability to decentralize knowledge graphs (KG) is important to exploit the full potential of the Semantic Web and realize the Web 3.0 vision. However, decentralization also renders KGs more prone to attacks with adverse effects on data integrity and query verifiability. While existing studies focus on ensuring data integrity, how to ensure query verifiability - thus guarding against incorrect, incomplete, or outdated query results - remains unsolved. We propose VeriDKG, the first SPARQL query engine for decentralized knowledge graphs (DKG) that offers both data integrity and query verifiability guarantees. The core of VeriDKG is the RGB-Trie, a new blockchain-maintained authenticated data structure (ADS) facilitating correctness proofs for SPARQL query results. VeriDKG enables verifiability of subqueries by gathering global index information on subgraphs using the RGB-Trie, which is implemented as a new variant of the Merkle prefix tree with an RGB color model. To enable verifiability of the final query result, the RGB-Trie is integrated with a cryptographic accumulator to support verifiable aggregation operations. A rigorous analysis of query verifiability in VeriDKG is presented, along with evidence from an extensive experimental study demonstrating its state-of-the-art query performance on the largeRDFbench benchmark.},

To do so, our approach introduces a data structure that (i) keeps track of the execution of an automaton (ii) has predictable parameters and size, and (iii) guarantees strong eventual consistency. The second approach defines decentralized specifications wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system. We study two properties of decentralized specifications pertaining to monitorability and compatibility between specification and architecture. We also present a general algorithm for monitoring decentralized specifications. We map three existing algorithms to our approaches and provide a framework for analyzing their behavior. Furthermore, we present THEMIS, a framework for designing such decentralized algorithms and simulating their behavior. We demonstrate the usage of THEMIS to compare multiple algorithms and validate the trends predicted by the analysis in two scenarios: a synthetic benchmark and the Chiron user interface.},

abstract = {In an effort to contain the Covid-19 pandemic emergency, nations have sponsored smartphones apps tracing contacts. The ultimate aim is to alert people when a Covid-19-positive has been found and it occurs that they have been in close contact with the positive. In the context of contact tracing, transparency of data gathered is of utmost importance to show beyond doubt that the people privacy is preserved as much as possible. The proposed approach aims at making gathered data publicly available in such a way that anonymity is preserved and stored data are immutable and not owned by a single organization. For this, we equip users in a university environment with an app that reveals their presence as a proximity to a WiFi access point. While the server-side provides location ids to apps, the location history is kept within the app and checks for a possible contact are performed by the app. The server aggregates presence data related to each WiFi access point according to time-slots, and stores these periodically in a blockchain for maximum transparency and immutability. The tests on the developed prototype have shown the accuracy in determining presence data, the feasibility for apps to interact with smart contracts and to have daily presence data stored in a blockchain. The ability to exhibit official and immutable statistics on people gathering at university should be useful to give evidence of the effort to have controlled accesses and gathering avoidance.},

abstract = {This paper investigates pricing-based spectrum access control in cognitive radio networks, where primary users (PUs) sell the temporarily unused spectrum and secondary users (SUs) compete via random access for such spectrum opportunities. Compared to existing market-based approaches with centralized scheduling, pricing-based spectrum management with random access provides a platform for SUs contending for spectrum access and is amenable to decentralized implementation due to its low complexity. We focus on two market models, one with a monopoly PU market and the other with a multiple-PU market. For the monopoly PU market model, we devise decentralized pricing-based spectrum access mechanisms that enable SUs to contend for channel usage. Specifically, we first consider SUs contending via slotted Aloha. Since the revenue maximization problem therein is nonconvex, we characterize the corresponding Pareto-optimal region and obtain a Pareto-optimal solution that maximizes the SUs' throughput subject to their budget constraints. To mitigate the spectrum underutilization due to the "price of contention," we revisit the problem where SUs contend via CSMA, which results in more efficient spectrum utilization and higher revenue. We then study the tradeoff between the PU's utility and its revenue when the PU's salable spectrum is controllable. Next, for the multiple-PU market model, we cast the competition among PUs as a three-stage Stackelberg game, where each SU selects a PU's channel to maximize its throughput. We explore the existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium, in terms of access prices and the spectrum offered to SUs, and develop an iterative algorithm for strategy adaptation to achieve the Nash equilibrium. Our findings reveal that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium when the number of PUs is less than a threshold determined by the budgets and elasticity of SUs.},

abstract = {This article presents the state-of-the-art in optimal solution methods for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs), which are general models for collaborative multiagent planning under uncertainty. Building off the generalized multiagent A* (GMAA*) algorithm, which reduces the problem to a tree of one-shot collaborative Bayesian games (CBGs), we describe several advances that greatly expand the range of Dec-POMDPs that can be solved optimally. First, we introduce lossless incremental clustering of the CBGs solved by GMAA*, which achieves exponential speedups without sacrificing optimality. Second, we introduce incremental expansion of nodes in the GMAA* search tree, which avoids the need to expand all children, the number of which is in the worst case doubly exponential in the node's depth. This is particularly beneficial when little clustering is possible. In addition, we introduce new hybrid heuristic representations that are more compact and thereby enable the solution of larger Dec-POMDPs. We provide theoretical guarantees that, when a suitable heuristic is used, both incremental clustering and incremental expansion yield algorithms that are both complete and search equivalent. Finally, we present extensive empirical results demonstrating that GMAA*-ICE, an algorithm that synthesizes these advances, can optimally solve Dec-POMDPs of unprecedented size.},

The problem of untrustworthy online information is augmented by its high economic potential and its dynamic nature, e.g. transient domain names, dynamic content, etc. In this paper, we address the problem of assessing the credibility of web pages by a decentralized social recommender system. Specifically, we concurrently employ i) item-based collaborative filtering (CF) based on specific web page features, ii) user-based CF based on friend ratings and iii) the ranking of the page in search results. These factors are appropriately combined into a single assessment based on adaptive weights that depend on their effectiveness for different topics and different fractions of malicious ratings. Simulation experiments with real traces of web page credibility evaluations suggest that our hybrid approach outperforms both its constituent components and classical content-based classification approaches.},

abstract = {The performance of large-scale peer-to-peer P2P video-on-demand VoD streaming systems can be very challenging to analyze due to sparse connectivity and complex, random dynamics. Specifically, in practical P2P VoD systems, each peer only interacts with a small number of other peers/neighbors. Furthermore, its upload capacity, downloading position, and content availability change dynamically and randomly. In this paper, we rigorously study large-scale P2P VoD systems with sparse connectivity among peers and investigate simple and decentralized P2P control strategies that can provably achieve close-to-optimal streaming capacity. We first focus on a single streaming channel. Using a simple algorithm that assigns each peer a random set of $Theta log N$  neighbors and allocates upload capacity uniformly, we show that a close-to-optimal streaming rate can be asymptotically achieved for all peers with high probability as the number of peers $N$ increases. Furthermore, the tracker does not need to obtain detailed knowledge of which chunks each peer caches, and hence incurs low overhead. We then study multiple streaming channels where peers watching one channel may help peers in another channel with insufficient upload bandwidth. We propose a simple random cache-placement strategy and show that a close-to-optimal streaming capacity region for all channels can be attained with high probability, again with only $Theta log N$  per-peer neighbors. These results provide important insights into the dynamics of large-scale P2P VoD systems, which will be useful for guiding the design of improved P2P control protocols.},

abstract = {The cloud-computing paradigm offers on-demand services over the Internet and supports a wide variety of applications. With the recent growth of Internet of Things (IoT)--based applications, the use of cloud services is increasing exponentially. The next generation of cloud computing must be energy efficient and sustainable to fulfill end-user requirements, which are changing dynamically. Presently, cloud providers are facing challenges to ensure the energy efficiency and sustainability of their services. The use of a large number of cloud datacenters increases cost as well as carbon footprints, which further affects the sustainability of cloud services. In this article, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable cloud computing. The taxonomy is used to investigate the existing techniques for sustainability that need careful attention and investigation as proposed by several academic and industry groups. The current research on sustainable cloud computing is organized into several categories: application design, sustainability metrics, capacity planning, energy management, virtualization, thermal-aware scheduling, cooling management, renewable energy, and waste heat utilization. The existing techniques have been compared and categorized based on common characteristics and properties. A conceptual model for sustainable cloud computing has been presented along with a discussion on future research directions.},

abstract = {Developing countries are faced with the daunting challenge of lowering their neonate and child mortality rates. Studies have indicated that up to 13\% of the deaths of children under the age of five could be prevented by breastfeeding alone. One key barrier is the availability of breast milk for vulnerable infants (those born pre-term, with low birth-weight, to HIV-positive mothers, or orphaned at birth). One strategy to increase availability of breast milk is establishing human milk banks that process donor milk. However, it has been difficult to provide safe, pasteurized donor breast milk to infants in developing countries due to cost and lack of infrastructure. Low-cost pasteurization methods require rigorous temperature monitoring and quality assurance processes for adoption at scale.In this paper, we present an affordable system to monitor breast milk pasteurization. It leverages mobile and sensing technologies to enhance an existing, low-cost pasteurization method called flash heat pasteurization. A mobile application, running on an Android phone that is connected to a temperature probe, monitors milk temperatures during pasteurization, and provides audiovisual feedback to guide users performing the procedure. At the end of the procedure, users are able to print a pasteurization report, and labels for pasteurized milk jars from the mobile application. The pasteurization temperature curve is also uploaded to a server that enables supervisors to remotely review procedures and perform audits to ensure that procedures are being performed correctly.We discuss the lessons learned from ongoing deployments at two locations in Durban, South Africa. To date they have processed microbial assays for 40 donor milk samples in which 31 samples showed microbial activity pre-pasteurization, while none of the post-pasteurized samples show any microbial growth. We are currently working with the Human Milk Banking Association of South Africa to scale up the use of the system to more sites.},

abstract = {Despite the recent appearance of self-organizing distributed systems for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, specific theoretical aspects of both their properties and the mechanisms used to establish those properties have been largely overlooked. This has left many researchers confused as to what constitutes a self-organizing distributed system and without a vocabulary with which to discuss aspects of these systems. This article introduces an agent-based model of self-organizing MANET and P2P systems and shows how it is realised in three existing network systems. The model is based on concepts such as partial views, evaluation functions, system utility, feedback and decay. We review the three network systems, AntHocNet, SAMPLE, and Freenet, and show how they can achieve high scalability, robustness and adaptability to unpredictable changes in their environment, by using self-organizing mechanisms similar to those found in nature. They are designed to improve their operation in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, enabling them to often demonstrate superior performance to state of the art distributed systems. This article is also addressed at researchers interested in gaining a general understanding of different mechanisms and properties of self-organization in distributed systems.},

Inspired by this, we aim to construct learning dynamics where potentially beneficial social norms can emerge. Since social norms are underpinned by sanctioning, we introduce a training regime where agents can access all sanctioning events but learning is otherwise decentralized. This setting is technologically interesting because sanctioning events may be the only available public signal in decentralized multi-agent systems where reward or policy-sharing is infeasible or undesirable. To achieve collective action in this setting, we construct an agent architecture containing a classifier module that categorizes observed behaviors as approved or disapproved, and a motivation to punish in accord with the group. We show that social norms emerge in multi-agent systems containing this agent and investigate the conditions under which this helps them achieve socially beneficial outcomes.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of efficient content delivery over networks in which individual nodes are equipped with content caching capabilities. We present a flexible methodology for the design of cooperative, decentralized caching strategies that can adapt to real-time changes in regional content popularity. This design methodology makes use of a recently proposed reduced consensus optimization scheme, in which a number of networked agents cooperate in locating the optimum of the sum of their individual, privately known objective functions. The outcome of the design is a set of dynamic update rules that stipulate how much and which portions of each content piece an individual network node ought to cache. In implementing these update rules, the nodes achieve a collectively optimal caching configuration through nearest-neighbor interactions and measurements of local content request rates only. Moreover, individual nodes need not be aware of the overall network topology or how many other nodes are on the network. The desired caching behavior is encoded in the design of individual nodes' costs and can incorporate a variety of network performance criteria. Using the proposed methodology, we develop a set of content-caching update rules designed to minimize the energy consumption of the network as a whole by dynamically trading off transport and caching energy costs in response to changes in content demand.},

In many cases this results in mixed organizational forms of central and decentralized maintenance.

For an ANC system with multiple secondary sources and error microphones, one approach to reducing computational complexity is to apply a decentralized control scheme rather than centralized approaches. A decentralized scheme attempts to control a number of small-size ANC subsystems independently. In this paper, we consider the decentralized control of a two-channel ANC system tackling a noise disturbance in the frequency domain, where each channel consists of one secondary source and one error microphone. We propose a decentralized control method that is able to achieve the same noise reduction performance as the centralized controller with guaranteed convergence. The key step in designing the control method is to properly shape the eigenvalues of a matrix that models the two-channel secondary paths for each frequency index.},

Formally it is defined as a Multi-Mode Resource-constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem with splitting activities. Problems that display these characteristics are often difficult to solve with classical scheduling approaches within acceptable runtime. Simulation-Based Optimization offers an auspicious manner of dealing with those domain specific problems. Using this approach we present a decentralized heuristic evident in self-organization in nature. Typical algorithms attempt to solve the above problems globally. In our solution, the jobs of the network take over the active role. They communicate with their neighbors and the allocated resources, each having the local goal to optimize their own situation.},

abstract = {Threshold signatures protect the signing key by sharing it among a group of signers so that an adversary must corrupt a threshold number of signers to be able to forge signatures. Existing threshold signatures with succinct signatures and constant verification times do not work if signers have different weights. Such weighted settings are seeing increasing importance in decentralized systems, especially in the Proof-of-Stake blockchains. This paper presents a new paradigm for threshold signatures for pairing and discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems. Our scheme has a compact verification key consisting of only 7 group elements, and a signature consisting of 8 group elements. Verifying the signature requires 8 exponentiations and 8 bilinear pairings. Our scheme supports arbitrary weight distributions among signers and arbitrary thresholds. It requires non-interactive preprocessing after a universal powers-of-tau setup. We prove the security of our scheme in the Algebraic Group Model and implement it using Golang. Our evaluation shows that our scheme achieves a comparable signature size and verification time to a standard (unweighted) threshold signature. Compared to existing multisignature schemes, our scheme has a much smaller public verification key.},

For example, a service request may represent the detection of an event in a sensor network application, which needs to be investigated on site. Once a service request has been generated, it remains active for an amount of time which is itself a random variable, and then expires. The problem we investigate is the following: what is the minimum number of mobile agents needed to ensure that each service request is fulfilled before expiring, with probability at least 1 − ε? What strategy should they use to ensure this objective is attained? Formulating the probability of successfully servicing requests before expiration as a performance metric, we derive bounds on the minimum number of agents required to ensure a given performance level, and present decentralized motion coordination algorithms that approximate the optimal strategy.},

abstract = {Increased use of autonomy also increases the need for humans to interact with or manage autonomy. We propose a new variation of sliding autonomy useful for planning problems over a spatial region. With this approach, the user can influence the behavior of the autonomous system via spatial constraints and temporal constraints. We present a set of user interface designs to implement sliding autonomy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle path-planning to support Wilderness Search and Rescue. Interactivities along these new dimensions allow the user to allocate degrees of authority and flexibility to the robot's algorithms. We evaluate the usefulness of the approach against manual and simple pattern path-planning methods with a user study. Results show that the sliding autonomy approach performs significantly better than the other two methods without increasing the users' mental workload, and the performance of the human-autonomy team outperforms either human or autonomy working alone.},

abstract = {To achieve an optimal outcome in many situations, agents need to choose distinct actions from one another. This is the case notably in many resource allocation problems, where a single resource can only be used by one agent at a time. How shall a designer of a multi-agent system program its identical agents to behave each in a different way?From a game theoretic perspective, such situations lead to undesirable Nash equilibria. For example consider a resource allocation game in that two players compete for an exclusive access to a single resource. It has three Nash equilibria. The two pure-strategy NE are efficient, but not fair. The one mixed-strategy NE is fair, but not efficient. Aumann's notion of correlated equilibrium fixes this problem: It assumes a correlation device that suggests each agent an action to take.However, such a "smart" coordination device might not be available. We propose using a randomly chosen, "stupid" integer coordination signal. "Smart" agents learn which action they should use for each value of the coordination signal.We present a multi-agent learning algorithm that converges in polynomial number of steps to a correlated equilibrium of a channel allocation game, a variant of the resource allocation game. We show that the agents learn to play for each coordination signal value a randomly chosen pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the game. Therefore, the outcome is an efficient correlated equilibrium. This CE becomes more fair as the number of the available coordination signal values increases.},

abstract = {Key management has long remained a difficult unsolved problem in the field of usable security. While password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) are widely used to solve this problem in centralized applications, their low entropy and lack of a recovery mechanism make them unsuitable for use in decentralized contexts. The multi-factor key derivation function (MFKDF) is a recently proposed cryptographic primitive that aims to address these deficiencies by incorporating commonly used authentication factors into the key derivation process. In this paper, we implement an MFKDF-based Ethereum wallet and perform a user study with 27 participants to directly compare its usability against traditional cryptocurrency wallet architectures. Our results show that MFKDF-based applications outperform conventional key management approaches on both subjective and objective metrics, with a 37\% higher average SUS score (p &lt; 0.0001) and 71\% faster task completion times (p &lt; 0.0001) for the MFKDF-based wallet.},

First, we propose a new model, Event-Driven Interaction with Complex Rewards, that addresses problems having structured transition and reward dependence. Our model captures a wider range of problems than existing structured models. In spite of its generality, the model still offers structure that can be leveraged by heuristics and solution algorithms. This is facilitated by explicitly representing interactions as first-class entities. We formulate and solve instances of our model as bilinear programs. Second, we look at making offline planning for communication tractable. To this end, we propose heuristics that limit problem size by making communication available only at a few strategically chosen points based on an analysis that exploits problem structure in the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate a reduction in problem size and solution time using restricted communication, with little or no decrease in solution quality. Our heuristics therefore allow us to solve problems that would otherwise be intractable.},

Nonetheless, with exponential spread of mobile wireless devices, continued improvements in spectrum utilization, resource allocation, hardware miniaturization, and development of new renewable energy sources, we find ourselves still very much in the infancy of the development of such networks, which have the potential to grow and become orders-of-magnitude more sophisticated.}

abstract = {The number of devices connected to the Internet has been increasing exponentially. There is a substantial amount of data being exchanged among numerous connected devices. The added convenience brought by these devices spans across multiple facets of everyday life, such as drivers reporting an accident through dash cams, patients monitoring their own health, and companies controlling the safety of their facilities. However, it is critical to increase safety and privacy across the data generated and propagated by these devices. Previous works have focused mainly on device management and relied on centralized solutions namely Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This paper describes a novel mechanism that ensures secure autonomous communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, while using a completely decentralized solution that mitigates the classical single points-of-failure problem. This is accomplished by a new peer-to-peer protocol using Short Authentication Strings (SAS), in which verification is made through a Limited-Location Channel (LLC).},

Prior studies have reported volunteer moderators' diverse roles in different governance models, highlighting the tensions between moderators and other stakeholders (e.g., administrative teams and users). Building upon prior research, this paper focuses on how volunteer moderators moderate racist content and how a platform's governance influences these practices. To understand how moderators deal with racist content, we conducted in-depth interviews with 13 moderators from city subreddits on Reddit. We found that moderators heavily relied on AutoMod to regulate racist content and racist user accounts. However, content that was crafted through covert racism and "color-blind'' racial frames was not addressed well. We attributed these challenges in moderating racist content to (1) moderators' concerns of power corruption, (2) arbitrary moderator team structures, and (3) evolving forms of covert racism. Our results demonstrate that decentralized governance on Reddit could not support local efforts to regulate color-blind racism. Finally, we discuss the conceptual and practical ways to disrupt color-blind moderation.},

abstract = {In recent years, machine learning models have evolved, and the training of these models requires large amounts of data. However, the training data often contains sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. Federated Learning has been proposed as a solution to mitigate privacy risks. Despite its advantages, Federated Learning still faces challenges such as the aggregator being a single point of failure, the existence of malicious participants, and the lack of incentives. Combining Federated Learning with blockchain technology could potentially address these challenges. In this study, we propose a new method for asynchronous Federated Learning using blockchain smart contracts. Our proposed method operates autonomously and in a decentralized manner without the need to trust any central organization, making it trustless. We propose an algorithm that motivates workers to submit high-quality models as quickly as possible. Workers’ behaviors are driven by incentive mechanisms. We deployed a smart contract on a local Ethereum blockchain and executed multiple workers. Our evaluation results demonstrate that learning converges and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional Federated Learning, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {Sidelink relay, authorized as an independent work item in both 3GPP R17 and R18, is a promising technology for facilitating future V2X communication in 5G New Radio (NR). As specified by 3GPP, several important factors of NR sidelink, including flexible hop-by-hop operation mode selection, sidelink path loss based power control, and resource sharing with uplink communications, were partially (if not totally) ignored in available studies. In light of this, we propose a general multi-hop NR sidelink relay scheme, namely, NSR-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$(rho,omega,m)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, for flexible dissemination of a typical Decentralized Environmental Notification Message (DENM). To efficiently characterize the multi-hop DENM dissemination process under NSR-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$(rho,omega,m)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, we further develop a stochastic geometry-based theoretical framework, by carefully taking into account the above 3GPP specified important factors. With the help of the theoretical framework, we are able to derive the end-to-end delivery probability and the total dissemination distance of a given DENM. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical framework. For a given DENM with a limited lifetime, it is also proved that the NSR-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$(rho,omega,m)$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; scheme is of great potential in significantly expanding the achievable performance region, by properly tuning the parameters &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$rho $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$omega $ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;, and &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$m$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the benefits of cooperation and proposes a relay activation strategy for a large wireless network with multiple transmitters. In this framework, some nodes cooperate with a nearby node that acts as a relay, using the decode-and-forward protocol, and others use direct transmission. The network is modeled as an independently marked Poisson point process, and the source nodes may choose their relays from the set of inactive nodes. Although cooperation can potentially lead to significant improvements in the performance of a communication pair, relaying causes additional interference in the network, increasing the average noise that other nodes see. We investigate how source nodes should balance cooperation versus interference to obtain reliable transmissions, and for this purpose, we study and optimize a relay activation strategy with respect to the outage probability. Surprisingly, in the high reliability regime, the optimized strategy consists on the activation of all the relays or none at all, depending on network parameters. We provide a simple closed-form expression that indicates when the relays should be active, and we introduce closed-form expressions that quantify the performance gains of this scheme with respect to a network that only uses direct transmission.},

abstract = {The centralized nature of Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides the global view of the network topology at the SDN controller. Therefore, the controller should collect up-to-date information of network state, particularly its topology. Most of the current SDN controller platforms perform topology discovery using OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP) mechanism, which leverages (LLDP) the Link Layer Discovery Protocol. Unfortunately, the current topology discovery approach does not care about quality of service (QoS) information of underneath devices. But fortunately, QoS-aware topology discovery can be done with the same method, due to the structure of the LLDP packet. In this paper, we propose aggregated QoS-aware topology discovery mechanism, based on LLDP, over Decentralized Software Defined Wireless Mesh Network (D-SDWMN) architecture to collect and aggregate the topology and its corresponding QoS information, to support QoS-aware policies and decisions in SDN-based WMN. The experiment results present the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in term of QoS information collection with just slightly extra network traffic overhead, and without overall network traffic performance deteriorate.},
