abstract = {This article presents a case study of the struggles of South Sudan, the newest country to develop a new electricity grid, and the strategic choices it faces in a post-conflict situation. In addition to the energy trilemma around security, price, and sustainability, we add a fourth consideration for policy, namely the distribution of benefits and ability of government both to provide collective goods and to use them to reinforce its power in the context of the resource curse. Despite having an abundance of oil, South Sudan has struggled to build its grid. Ongoing conflict, geographical distance, ethnic differences, and more practical factors including lack of capital all play a role. This has led the government to adopt plans for a centralized grid, which it is unable to execute in a timely fashion. As a result, the country has a de facto set of decentralized energy systems. Our analysis reveals that neither a centralized nor a decentralized approach best resolves such tradeoffs. Instead, we conclude a hybrid approach makes the most sense in a post-conflict situation. This preserves the possibility of providing long-term grid connections while acknowledging the need for immediate energy access.}

abstract = {Blockchain has received a widespread attention because of its decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent nature. Blockchain works over the principle of distributed, secured, and shared ledger, which is used to record, and track data within a decentralized network. This technology has successfully replaced certain systems of economic transactions in organizations and has the potential to overtake various industrial business models in future. Blockchain works over peer-to-peer (P2P) phenomenon for its operation and does not require any trusted-third party authorization for data tracking and storage. The information stored in blockchain is distributed throughout the decentralized network and is usually protected using cryptographic hash functions. Since the beginning of blockchain technology, its use in different applications is increasing exponentially, but this increased use has also raised some questions regarding privacy and security of data being stored in it. Protecting privacy of blockchain data using data perturbation strategy such as differential privacy could be a novel approach to overcome privacy issues in blockchain. In this article, we cover the topic of integration of differential privacy in each layer of blockchain and in certain blockchain based scenarios. Moreover, we highlight some future challenges and application scenarios in which integration of differential privacy in blockchain can produce fruitful results.}

But sometimes it is necessary to evaluate an organizational structure autonomously, when it is available only the limited information about structure: the numbers of hierarchical levels and the subjects on each level. This paper focuses on autonomous approach. It is based on the questions-criteria hierarchy constructed using fundamental laws. Some experimental results are presented.}

This relational co-creation is particularly important in the founding years of the co-operative and at points of crisis and regeneration in the co-operative lifecycle. This paper explores the relationship between member openness towards relational engagement and their perception of the co-operative’s openness to that input (perceived openness) in a credit union context, prior to a major period of restructuring. Perceived openness is examined from two distinct perspectives, that is, awareness of right of involvement as owners (which in this paper we equated with co-operative member ownership structure) and possibility of involvement or perception of organisation openness (which in this paper we equated with co-operative process). It was found in the multivariate Logistic model that possibility rather than right of involvement is related to member openness. This suggests that the process of co-operation in a co-operative plays a greater role than the organisational structure of that co-operative in facilitating member input. This is a significant finding and suggests that greater attention needs to be given to process and openness in co-operative research and practice. It also suggests that co-operatives cannot just draw on their member ownership structure, in building member engagement at time of crisis.}

Despite decades of evolving regulatory measures, wild rhinoceros populations remain threatened by illegal killing to acquire rhino horn, a valuable commodity in East Asian markets. In Africa, rhino conservation performance has varied with geography and over time. This research draws on institutional economic theories to seek plausible explanations for such variable conservation outcomes. Such theories suggest that institutional variables such as property rights profoundly influence human behaviour, leading to hypotheses that we test using comparative institutional analytic methods. Our inquiry affirms that blanket trade restrictions do not account for local conservation success and that other institutional factors appear more relevant. We find that positive overall conservation outcomes correlate with greater institutional diversity within countries, notably those that enable non-state actors to play a meaningful role in rhino management. Our research further suggests that strengthening institutions through decentralization is a sensible conservation strategy for rhinos. However, a specific case study of the economics of white rhino ownership in South Africa reveals that this approach is not considered a panacea for conservation as it raises concerns over potential domestication. We conclude with recommendations for policy—notably, to avoid recentralization—and further research.}

Blockchain is a combination of blocks of transactions that are validated and verified by the process of consensus. Organizations and businesses can use it for cost-cutting, security, and decentralization. Because of its decentralized structure, the blockchain is extremely safe, as there is no single point of failure. We will focus on blockchain architecture and security concerns in this chapter, including decentralization, mining, consensus, smart contracts, and more.

To cope with environmental challenges, and to achieve carbon neutrality, fiscal decentralization and eco-innovation are promising strategies that can also enable countries and local governments to pursue visible economic growth. This study investigates the role of export diversification, environment-related technological innovation, and fiscal decentralization in effectively achieving carbon neutrality target for 37 OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) economies from 1970 to 2019. For empirical analysis, it uses second-generation tests that deal with heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence issues. To this end, this study employs updated cointegration techniques. The augmented mean group (AMG) approach is used to examine the long-run dynamic equilibrium among the variables of interest. The findings indicate that export diversification and fiscal decentralization followed by GDP growth affect carbon dioxide emission positively. While renewable energy consumption and environment-related technological innovation assure environmental improvement. Additionally, short-run causal and unidirectional links are found running from fiscal decentralization, export diversification, and environment-related technological innovation to carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that OECD partner countries need to be careful while devising fiscal decentralization and export diversification policies. They should increase the share of renewable energy, and expand environment-related technological innovation. Such strategic efforts would direct the OECD countries to meet the climate change mitigation agenda of sustainable development goals.}

Through a review of the literature on the governance of coastal wetlands, we assessed the drivers influencing the governance of coastal wetlands. We found 66 cases addressing seven governance themes: politics, institutions, land tenure, economy, policies, resources, and behavior. The literature was dominated by studies focused on the protection of mangrove areas in lower-middle-income countries and at the local scale. We found 61 drivers that influence the governance of coastal wetlands. The literature highlighted the participation of local communities as a critical driver of protection and restoration practices and identified a range of challenges. Local communities’ participation in governance depends on the implementation of multilevel, decentralized, and integrated practices that promote equitable distribution of power between actors. Solutions to enhance local community rights and land tenure, compensation for alternative livelihoods, and unequal power dynamics are significant knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in future research.}

Underpinned by technological advancements, computer systems, far from being static, have been continuously evolving and adapting to cover multifaceted societal niches. This has led to new paradigms such as cloud, fog, edge computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), which offer fresh economic and creative opportunities. Nevertheless, this rapid change poses complex research challenges, especially in maximizing potential and enhancing functionality. As such, to maintain an economical level of performance that meets ever-tighter requirements, one must understand the drivers of new model emergence and expansion, and how contemporary challenges differ from past ones. To that end, this article investigates and assesses the factors influencing the evolution of computing systems, covering established systems and architectures as well as newer developments, such as serverless computing, quantum computing, and on-device AI on edge devices. Trends emerge when one traces technological trajectory, which includes the rapid obsolescence of frameworks due to business and technical constraints, a move towards specialized systems and models, and varying approaches to centralized and decentralized control. This comprehensive review of modern computing systems looks ahead to the future of research in the field, highlighting key challenges and emerging trends, and underscoring their importance in cost-effectively driving technological progress.}

The progressive introduction of connected satellite systems and associated mission concepts is stimulating the development of intelligent CPS (iCPS) architectures, which can support high levels of flexibility and resilience in an increasingly congested near-Earth space environment. The need for higher levels of automation and autonomy in satellite operations has stimulated numerous research initiatives in recent years, focusing on the progressive enhancement of systemic performance (e.g., addressing safety, integrity and cyber-physical security metrics) and associated monitoring/augmentation approaches that can support Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operations (TASO). Despite these advances, in most contemporary satellite platforms, autonomy is restricted to a specific set of rules and cases, while the transition to TASO requires a paradigm shift in the design of both space vehicles and ground-based systems. In particular, the use of AI is seen as an essential enabler for TASO as it enhances system performance/adaptability and supports both predictive and reactive integrity augmentation capabilities, especially in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS). This article provides a critical review of AI for satellite operations, with a special focus on current and likely future DSS architectures for communication, navigation and remote sensing missions. The aim is to identify key contemporary challenges and opportunities associated with space iCPS design methodologies to enhance the performance and resilience of satellite systems, supporting the progressive transition to TASO. A comprehensive review of relevant AI techniques is presented to critically assess the potential benefits and challenges of each method for different space applications. After describing the specificities of DSS and the opportunities offered by iCPS architectures, the co-evolution of space and control (ground and on-board) segments is highlighted as an essential next step towards enabling TASO. As an integral part of this evolutionary approach, the most important legal and regulatory challenges associated with the adoption of AI in TASO are also discussed.}

The research was carried out through interviews with the IT and business managers in subsidiaries of nine large American, European, and Japanese multinationals. The evidence from this study reveals that, in the majority of these organisations, IS planning is either centralised or moving towards centralisation. The main focus of IS planning, in many of these organisations, is to control cost and achieve scale economies. As centralisation increases IT tends to control the planning process and, as a result, IS planning becomes more tactical than strategic and is dominated by IT infrastructure planning. Project implementation was the main criterion used to measure IS planning success. However, due to the dominant role of IT, the subsidiary business managers are often less satisfied with the IS planning approach compared with the subsidiary IT managers. The level of involvement of business managers and their satisfaction with ISSP was related to the degree of decentralisation of responsibility for IS planning.}

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes.

Current research aims at increasing the level of automation and/or partial delegation of the control to on-board systems. In this work, we investigate the collision avoidance management problem using a decentralized distributed approach. We propose an autonomous and generic multi-agent system to address this complex problem, where mobile entities are agents, that use a finite set of discrete speed vector modifications to follow their trajectories while avoiding separation losses. We validate our system using a state-of-the-art benchmark. The results underline the adequacy of our local and cooperative approach to efficiently solve the studied problem, competing with centralized methods.

This delegation is known as the decentralization of controlling power and is a powerful security mechanism for the ecosystem. After the introduction of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency has seen widespread attention from industry and academia, so much so that the original novel contribution of Bitcoin, i.e., decentralization, may be overlooked, due to decentralizations’ assumed fundamental existence for the functioning of such crypto-assets. However, recent studies have observed a trend of increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As this increased centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain, it is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate control. This research derives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review. This is followed by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We systematically analyzed 89 research papers published between 2009 and 2019. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the multiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We identify different aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing taxonomy of centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of centralization, classified over six architectural layers: Governance, Network, Consensus, Incentive, Operational, and Application. We also discuss how the implications of centralization can vary depending on the aspects studied. We believe that this review and taxonomy provides a comprehensive overview of centralization in decentralized blockchains involving various conceptualizations and measures.}

We address these concerns by critically assessing whether CBOs in rural Ukraine engage in meaningful partnerships with local governments. In doing so, we examine the link between participation and CBO establishment and clarify how lack of local governments' fiscal autonomy may undermine CBOs' sustainability. We use unique primary data and employ both qualitative and quantitative methods to test hypotheses about how these organizations were established. We find that newly-established organizations are disconnected from local inhabitants and are aligned with the fundraising incentives of local governments. The context of incomplete decentralization reforms common to post-Soviet countries distorts local governments’ incentives and, as a result, jeopardizes the sustainability of the CDD efforts.}

Here we review the emergence of the ecosystem lens within innovation studies in the context of the Special Issue on Innovation Ecosystems and Ecosystem Innovation. After summarizing the history of the special issue, we review the nine articles in the special issue and show how they relate to defining the actors, joint value creation by the actors, coordinating the actors, value capture by the actors, and then the large issue of analyzing ecosystems as the unit of analysis. From this, we offer suggestions for future ecosystem research, including opportunities to combine the ecosystem lens with other lenses used in innovation studies, and new methods for studying ecosystem phenomena.}

While there is growing research interest in these areas, examining the role of human element in the new smart shipping context is largely neglected. Through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to explore the multi-dimensional impact of autonomous shipping technology resulting from the application of Industry 4.0 and future industrial revolutions on seafarers. The impacts include the changing role of seafarers on-board and the strategies required to engage seafarers in their transition from traditional shipping to autonomous and smart shipping. The paper concludes that Industry 4.0 is being challenged for its shortfall in recognition of the importance of human role and its intelligence in the expected current industrial revolution. As a result, there is a demand to look further and beyond Industry 4.0 by introducing the next generation of industrial revolution, namely Industry 5.0.

Although offensive AI has been discussed in the past, there is a need to analyze and understand the threat in the context of organizations. For example, how does an AI-capable adversary impact the cyber kill chain? Does AI benefit the attacker more than the defender? What are the most significant AI threats facing organizations today and what will be their impact on the future? In this study, we explore the threat of offensive AI on organizations. First, we present the background and discuss how AI changes the adversary’s methods, strategies, goals, and overall attack model.

abstract = {Background
Rural nursing education stands as a way to contribute to a sustainable nurse workforce in rural areas. Different approaches to organizing rural nursing education are described in the existing literature.
Objective
To explore scientific reviews about rural nursing education and synthesize current knowledge as “best practice” recommendations for rural nursing education regarding the required organization of rural nursing education programs, what are the competencies required to function as a nurse in rural health-care settings, and the key environmental features for learning in rural nursing education programs.
Design
An umbrella review.
Participants
Nursing students, newly graduated nurses, and clinical supervisors involved in nursing education in rural areas.
Data sources
A systematic literature search was conducted. Of the 276 review articles found, 93 were screened by title and abstract and 27 were screened in full text. The period searched was 2000–2022, and the literature search was peer-reviewed and published.
Review methods
The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for umbrella reviews guided the design, search, and the reporting of the findings of the included reviews. Four reviewers screened for inclusion and exclusion using Covidence in a double blinded process. The analysis was guided by the JBI guidelines for umbrella review syntheses. Two reviewers conducted the analysis.
Results
Sixteen reviews were included; eight scoping reviews, six integrative reviews, one narrative review, and one rapid review. The synthesis of current evidence provides the following “best practice” suggestions: (a) fostering context-sensitive and collaboratively designed education environments is recommended; (b) integrating curricula tailored for the nursing role and rural practice is recommended (c) establishing a supportive learning environment that encourages students' motivation and academic success; and (d) clinical placements in locally developed learning settings address the educational needs required for practice in the rural workforce.
Conclusions
Rural nursing education needs to be properly aligned with the context and health-care development, to educate nurses who can meet the community's needs today and in the future. A well-functioning collaboration between university faculty and local community stakeholders in a co-creation process stands out as vital to build a sustainable, flexible, rural nursing education program.
Tweetable abstract
Umbrella review: Flexible, co-created education might be “best practice” in rural undergraduate nursing programs.}

Blockchain technology emerged as a decentralized approach for enhanced security without depending on trusted third parties to run services. Blockchain offers the benefits of trustworthiness and immutability and mitigates the problem of a single point of failure and other attacks. In this work, we present the state-of-the-art Blockchain-enabled IoVs (BIoVs) with a particular focus on their applications, such as crowdsourcing-based applications, energy trading, traffic congestion reduction, collision, accident avoidance, infotainment, and content caching. We also present in-depth applications of federated learning (FL) for BIoVs. The key challenges of integrating Blockchain with IoV are investigated in several domains, such as edge computing, machine learning, and Federated Learning (FL). Lastly, we present several open issues, challenges, and future opportunities in AI-enabled BIoV, hardware-assisted security for BIoV, and quantum computing attacks on BIoV applications.}

abstract = {Digitization in agriculture is rapidly advancing further on. New technologies and solutions were developed and get invented which ease farmers’ daily life, help them and their partners to gain knowledge about farming processes and environmental interrelations. This knowledge leads to better decisions and contributes to increased farm productivity, resource efficiency, and environmental health. Along with numerous advantages, some negative aspects and dependencies risk seamless workflow of agricultural production. Therefore, this study presents the state of the art of digitization in agriculture and points out vulnerabilities in digitized farming processes. The most important are the lack of interoperability and the dependency on internet connection. Hence, requirements are posed to meet these vulnerabilities in future IT (information technology) systems resulting in successive levels of resilience that cover the individual needs of farms adjusted to their mobile and landline internet supply. These findings are incorporated in a conceptual framework for a highly digitized fictive farm. Resilience is ensured by decentralized storage and computing capacities and internet independent communication networks including cooperation with machinery rings and contractors.}

abstract = {Policies aim to increase the penetration of renewable energy resources (RERs) to minimize the dependence on fossil fuels, have compelled different countries to devise their diverse blueprints by transforming smart grids infrastructure into futuristic grids or super smart grids (SSGs). Europe is taking the lead by developing SSGs by 2050, based on two exclusive alternatives, i.e., totally based on RERs and dispersed large decentralized networks. Critically assessing tensions in balancing load flow associated with RERs is a complicated task in SSGs. To solve this concern, the advanced probabilistic model is adopted in this research to observe the variations in demand and response profiles and mitigate it through transmission network planning using a super smart node transmission network topology (SSN). The proposed SSN transmission network topology outperforms the power synergy hub (PSHub) topology used in the existing literature through achieving an optimal load flow balancing in SSGs power infrastructure. This is also verified through simulation results, which provides an effective utilization of continuous spinning reserves (CSRs) and vehicle to grid (V2G) topologies integrated in an SSN transmission network topology for managing an optimized load flow balancing in SSGs. Additionally, this research work also provides a comprehensive overview of technical challenges in SSGs in terms of power flow control, their possible solutions, and future prospects. Finally, this paper concluded with the 2050 framework of futuristic SSGs, which provides a road map path for a sustainable and green energy environment for European infrastructure.}

Because the past, the present, and the future are co-defined, more attention should be paid to the way different time frames shape one another. In this article, we focus our attention on the influence of visions of the future on present practices. Drawing on qualitative research mainly in Belgium, France, and Germany, we explore how projected climate-just futures influence the practices of grassroots climate justice organizations in the present. For this purpose, we center our analysis on a macro-level vision that depicts a climate-just world as a world where domination systems (aka. capitalism, colonialism, or patriarchy) have been replaced in order to let a more egalitarian society strive. We use the concept of prefiguration to illustrate how this vision transforms organizing and mobilizing activities. Such transformative effects are exemplified in attempts at developing an alternative organizational culture and building alliances with marginalized groups, with more or less success.}

For these networks to be reliable and scalable, robust topology control algorithms must be developed to guide the deployment and geometric configuration of mobile nodes without a priori knowledge of the terrain. This article studies a disruption tolerant topology control mechanism based on differential evolution, called tcm-y, that directs the movements of autonomous vehicles to efficiently and dynamically deploy themselves into a uniformly dispersed configuration. tcm-y uses a Yao graph inspired fitness function to maintain a minimum desired number of connections for a node with its neighbors while uniformly dispersing autonomous vehicles over an unknown terrain. We present a formal analysis of tcm-y to show that it provides a disruption tolerant node spreading mechanism since any node will have at least k neighbors at all times. The performance of our tcm-y was tested in hostile environments where nodes systematically or randomly experience hostility and become disabled. The results from simulation experiments show that mobile nodes running tcm-y perform well in the face of neighbor losses with respect to nac, adt, and average connectivity, while limiting the number of network partitions that may occur as a result of node failures. The effectiveness of tcm-y was evaluated by comparing it with a popular non-deterministic node spreading mechanism that has similar objectives as tcm-y. The assessment shows that tcm-y performs significantly better with respect to average connectivity, pre-defined minimum number of neighbor connections, and average distance traveled at the expense of lower normalized area coverage. We also developed a testbed to perform real-time experiments with our tcm-y implemented in laptops to guide the movements of human operators towards a uniform distribution of mobile nodes. Real-time experiments performed on the testbed verified the results from our simulation experiments.}

Using cloud technologies like Kubernetes (K8s) can offer computational elasticity, yet may compromise FL privacy principles. K8s can jeopardise FL privacy by potentially allowing malicious FL clients to access other resources given its flat networking approach. This paper introduces the privacy-preserving K8s operator kubeFlower. It addresses privacy risks via isolation-by-design and differential privacy for data management. Isolation ensures secure resource sharing, while differential privacy safeguards individual data privacy. We introduce the Privacy Preserving Persistent Volume Claimer (P3-VC), which adds noise to data while managing a privacy budget. kubeFlower simplifies FL system management in K8s while ensuring privacy. We tested our approach on a network testbed composed of different geo-located cloud and edge nodes where FL clients are deployed. Our results demonstrate the approach’s efficacy in preserving privacy in K8s-based FL compared to benchmarks for cloud–edge environments.}

It is getting increasingly difficult to keep up with rising prices for everyday items in these countries, where the majority of the population is from the middle class or lower middle class. Inflation, pandemics, wars, and other important variables all contribute to price increases. There may be another significant factor at play, which is supply-chain corruption. The supply chain's unreliable, chaotic, and opaque nature is to blame for this corruption. We are concentrating on the agri-food supply chain in our study. Because many of the current agri-food supply chains are intricate and challenging to monitor, dishonest parties can exploit the situation. Therefore, we suggested a thorough blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to identify the source of price increases. The private Ethereum blockchain was used in the suggested system. Since the private Ethereum blockchain is more efficient, safe, and fast, it was chosen. Smart contracts were created to describe the system and its underlying rules and laws. Furthermore, in order to showcase the usefulness of our smart contracts, we exhibited a sample decentralized application to support our hypothesis. We also gave the system a complete security and vulnerability assessment to make sure it is operating properly and is protected from threats and attacks. Due to the use of blockchain, the system is immutable, transparent, and simple to track and monitor. The proposed system has demonstrated greater transparency, traceability, reliability, speed, security, and cost-efficiency compared to conventional systems. It effectively traces the origin of corruption in the supply chain, providing a more straightforward means to tackle concerns related to price hikes.}

In light of the resource and knowledge intensiveness of this often multi-year process, this study draws on paradox theory to identify the main organizational tensions emerging and persisting during the Industry 4.0 transformation of companies in a two-step approach. First, a systematic review of 73 academic papers on organizational challenges in Industry 4.0 adoption is conducted that summarizes 35 key challenges. Second, from these challenges a conceptual framework is built that illustrates the main tensions in Industry 4.0 implementation. The identified organizational tensions are categorized according to the learning, organizing, belonging, and performing categories proposed by the paradox theory. Moreover, resolution strategies to address these tensions have been drawn from the reviewed literature. These strategies are presented and linked to the individual tensions. Finally, tensions and resolution strategies were preliminary validated by a group of Industry 4.0 professionals during a workshop. As a result, the findings provide 23 tensions and 18 related resolution strategies illustrating how organizations can address to competing demands simultaneously when implementing Industry 4.0 technologies and thus raise their competitiveness and performance. Based on these results, the article discusses implications for operations management practitioners that can use the proposed framework to inform their strategies and decisions in Industry 4.0 implementation. Moreover, policymakers can adopt the results to develop focussed support actions for driving the Industry 4.0 transition. Finally, four main avenues for future research and implications for operations management scholars are provided.}

It is considered as the critical technology needed to drive the future evolution of manufacturing systems. At the same time, autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) developed as an essential part due to the flexibility they contribute to the whole manufacturing process within manufacturing systems. However, there are still open challenges in the intelligent control of these vehicles on the factory floor. Especially when considering dynamic environments where resources should be controlled in such a way, that they can be adjusted to turbulences efficiently. Therefore, this paper aimed to develop a conceptual framework for addressing a catalog of criteria that considers several machine learning algorithms to find the optimal algorithm for the intelligent control of AGVs. By applying the developed framework, an algorithm is automatically selected that is most suitable for the current operation of the AGV in order to enable efficient control within the factory environment. In future work, this decision-making framework can be transferred to even more scenarios with multiple AGV systems, including internal communication along with AGV fleets. With this study, the automatic selection of the optimal machine learning algorithm for the AGV improves the performance in such a way, that computational power is distributed within a hybrid system linking the AGV and cloud storage in an efficient manner.}

The first part of the chapter provides an introduction to the methodology, summarizing its historical and theoretical roots and sketching out its main features. An overview of the recent AB macroeconomic literature is then provided, presenting some of the main “families” of models that have contributed to its development. The second part focuses on the most recent contributions in the field provided by the Ancona research group, which are the result of a research agenda aiming at combining the AB bottom-up approach to macroeconomics with the Post-Keynesian Stock Flow Consistent (SFC) modeling framework [59]. These efforts culminated into the release of a brand-new simulation tool suite in Java (the Java Macro Agent-Based (JMAB) platform), explicitly designed for AB-SFC models, and of a benchmark AB-SFC model [17], dubbed “the AB Modellaccio.” In describing these two contributions and their successive refinements, we deepen several important theoretical and technical aspects of the AB-SFC modeling approach, and we argue that this novel framework has the potential to set an alternative paradigm in macromodeling. In the conclusions, we reflect on the current strengths and limits of the AB and SFC methodologies, highlighting the main challenges to be addressed in the next future.}

Therefore, based on the definition of hierarchical control, this paper surveys a wide range of literature on autonomous steering control from three aspects: 1) Perception layer acquires information about attitude deviation, geological conditions, and shield tail clearance; 2) Decision layer gives appropriate commands for thrust system, making the actual tunnel axis approach the designed one; 3) Execution layer designs feedback-based controllers to ensure the hydraulic cylinders accurately implement those commands. Ultimately, some future directions are highlighted to improve the efficiency and stability of tunneling.}

At present, the consumption of distributed renewable energy in China mainly depends on the power grid, but the amount of absorption is not ideal. Therefore, it is necessary to study the consumption mode of distributed renewable energy. This paper first analyzes the necessity of implementing the innovative consumption of distributed renewable energy power in China, discusses the consumption path of distributed renewable energy innovation based on resource bricolage, and analyzes the users in the innovation consumption path of distributed renewable energy power under the resource patchwork. It then proposes the innovation consumption mode of distributed renewable energy power under the resource patchwork: with distributed energy points as the center, the consumption model of "distributed renewable energy power + decentralized economy” is established. On this basis, the consumption mode of "distributed renewable energy power + distributed economy" is established. Finally, the dilemma of implementing the consumption model of distributed renewable energy under resource patchwork is discussed, and some suggestions are put forward for implementing the consumption model of distributed renewable energy under resource patchwork in China. The innovations in this paper include: (1) Analyzing the consumption of distributed renewable energy from the perspective of resource patchwork. (2) Pointing out the innovation absorption path of distributed renewable energy from the perspective of resource patchwork.

They have also been applied as performance standards to the assessment of particular organizations, often retrospectively in relation to their role in crisis situations or major disruptive events. Yet this essay argues that the concepts, reliability and resilience, as generally understood and applied to single organizations, have uncertain application to the ever-growing number of organizational networks. In this essay we will look particularly at: networks of contracted services or technology from private-sector organizations by government agencies or by other private organizations, interconnected critical infrastructure organizations, long-linked production and supply chains of various products and services, and interacting governments and private organizations in emergency management after natural disasters. The analysis of these networks will center around answering two basic and contrasting questions:A. Will the capacities for reliability or resilience of individual organizations within an organizational network create that capacity for the network overall to be reliable and resilient, and therefore, is improving individual organizational reliability and resilience an effective strategy for creating a more reliable and resilient organizational network as a whole?Or:B. Is it instead a paradox of organizational networks that unless reliability and resilience are first achieved as network properties, it is unlikely that the individual organizations in a network can themselves become reliable and resilient?The essay explores both questions in relation to current concepts of reliability (high-lighting high reliability organizations research) and resilience (of various types, including concepts of complex adaptive systems) and with illustrations from supply chains, interconnected infrastructures, contracted services, and emergency management networks. The essay concludes with an argument that current concepts of both reliability and resilience are ambiguous and incompletely specified – not clearly and fully enough developed to allow confident answers either question A or B. This, in itself, is a condition with both conceptual and practical implications, one that should compel further conceptual and case research.}

abstract = {The new European Union (EU) energy policystrengthens energy prosumers and decentralized energy systems.However, the literature lacks a clear definition and demarcation between energy consumers, prosumers, and producers; moreover, the new EU Directive from 2018 directly calls for increased efforts for clarification of the concepts and the creation of a regulatory framework. This study aims to conceptualize energy prosumption related to decentralized energy systems and the socio-economic perspective of the concept of sustainable development.The following variables are used in this research: (1) time horizon resulting from space–time variability, (2) the relationship between consumers’ energy demand and their own supplied production, and (3) the form of organization and ownership.According to this view, self-consumers have a self-production supply below the self-consumption demand for energy. In turn, a prosumer is defined by the prevailing economic activity at the continuum production–consumption scale. The research intends to offer criteria for policymakers, prosumers, and economists who design policy and energy systems in line with the EU policy.}

In this survey, we explore the potential opportunities and applications of blockchain technology in managing the exploration, production, and supply chain and logistics operations in the oil and gas industry as it can offer traceability, immutability, transparency, and audit features in a decentralized, trusted, and secure manner. We discuss state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes, research projects, business initiatives, and case studies to highlight the practicability of blockchain in the oil and gas industry. We present the potential opportunities brought about by blockchain technology in various use cases and application scenarios. We present several systems that use blockchain-based smart contracts to automate critical services such as petroleum product tracking and tracing, international trade document protection, and coordination of purchasing and bidding activities for granting oil exploration rights to petroleum exploration and development companies. Finally, we present open challenges acting as future research directions.}

In general, the framework conditions in Turkey are relatively good. The policy direction towards decentralisation will favour ADS. Many programmes offer support for water supply and renewable energy and there are simplified administrative procedures. On the other hand, water policy favours traditionally centralised conventional solutions. The awareness about ADS is very low and the research in the field still restricted. In this paper, concrete recommendations have been developed that suggest simple steps for the establishment of ADS in Turkey.}

abstract = {To reduce the negative impact of excessive traffic in large urban areas, many innovative concepts for intelligent transportation of people and freight have recently been developed. One of these concepts relies on autonomous delivery robots launched from trucks. A truck loads the freight dedicated to a set of customers in a central depot and moves into the city center. Also on board are small autonomous robots which each can be loaded with the freight dedicated to a single customer and launched from the truck. Then, the autonomous robots move to their dedicated customers and, after delivery, autonomously return to some robot depot in the city center. The truck can replenish robots at these decentralized depots to launch further of them until all its customers are supplied. To assess the potential of this innovative concept, this paper develops scheduling procedures which determine the truck route along robot depots and drop-off points where robots are launched, such that the weighted number of late customer deliveries is minimized. We formulate the resulting scheduling problem, investigate computational complexity, and develop suited solution methods. Furthermore, we benchmark the truck-based robot delivery concept with conventional attended home delivery by truck to assess the potential of this novel last-mile concept.}

The conventional credit risk assessment process utilises historical application data. However, reliable and dynamic transactional customer data are necessary for robust credit risk evaluation in practice. Therefore, this research proposes a framework for integrating blockchain and XAI to enable automated credit decisions. The main focus is on effectively integrating multi-party, privacy-preserving decentralised learning models with blockchain technology to provide reliability, transparency, and explainability. The proposed framework can be a foundation for integrating technological solutions while ensuring model verification, behavioural reliability, and model explainability for intelligent credit assessment.}

Unfortunately, it is often the case that new metaheuristic techniques are presented and assessed in a reduced set of cases, mostly due to the lack of computational resources to undertake extensive performance studies over a sufficiently diverse set of optimization benchmarks. This manuscript explores how ephemeral environments could be exploited to efficiently construct metaheuristic algorithms by virtue of a collaborative, distributed nature-inspired hyperheuristic framework specifically designed to be deployed over unreliable, uncoordinated computation nodes. To this end, the designed framework defines two types of nodes (trackers and peers, similarly to peer-to-peer networks), both reacting resiliently to unexpected disconnections of nodes disregarding their type. Peer nodes exchange their populations (i.e. constructed algorithms) asynchronously, so that local optima are avoided at every peer thanks to the contribution by other nodes. Furthermore, the overall platform is fully scalable, allowing its users to implement and share newly derived operators and fitness functions so as to enrich the diversity and universality of the heuristic algorithms found by the framework. Results obtained from in-lab experiments with a reduced number of nodes are discussed to shed light on the evolution of the best solution of the framework with the number of connected peers and the tolerance of the network to node disconnections.}

This lack of achievement is not only due to technical and economic constraints but also to decision-making of individual stakeholders who may explore decisions narrowly, for example solely on the maximization of short-term profits. Therefore, it is desirable to consider other combinations of decision-making by stakeholders to break out of this situation. However, it is challenging to grasp how individual decisions affect the entire maritime industry given market, technology, and competition complexity. In this study, we examine the investment strategies that stakeholders, especially policymakers, should adopt to promote the more rapid adoption of autonomous vessels. A simulator is developed which emulates the decisions and interplay of three types of activities: research and development, manufacturing, and operational activities. Patterns of adoption due to combinations of stakeholders' decisions are predicted to delay or accelerate the introduction of automation in the maritime industry. Specifically, this study estimates that the introduction of fully autonomous vessels can be accelerated by more than ten years through a mix of subsidies for prototyping, R&D (research and development) technology, deregulation for new technology, and encouraging ship operators to make safety-centric decisions.}

Independently run single microgrids (MGs) encounter difficulties with inadequate self-consumption of local renewable energy and frequent power exchange with the grid. Combining numerous MGs to form a multi-microgrid (MMG) is a viable approach to enhance smart distribution networks' operational and financial performance. However, the correlation and coordination of intermittent power generation within each MG network pose many techno-economic challenges for energy sharing and trading. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of these challenges within the framework of MMG operations. It examines state-of-the-art methodologies for optimizing multi-energy dispatch and scrutinizes contemporary strategies within energy markets that contribute to the resilience of power systems. The discourse extends to the burgeoning role of blockchain technology in revolutionizing decentralized market frameworks and the intricacies of MMG coordination for reliable and cost-effective energy distribution. Overall, this study provides ample inspiration for theoretical and practical research to the new entrants and experts alike to develop new concepts for energy markets, scheduling and novel operating models for future resilient multi-energy networked systems/MMGs.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to facilitate blockchain innovation immersion in accountancy organizations by providing tools that allow organizations to manage the change. The paper approaches blockchain technology (BT) through the lens of organizational change management, with a specific focus at the organization level.
Design/methodology/approach
A hybrid systematic literature review of relevant literature is presented based on recent research papers published in highly ranked scientific journals that capture how accounting organizations might manage the changes induced by BT.
Findings
The findings of the review indicate that implementing BT requires some new modus operandi. From individual behavior to organizational structure, the advantages of blockchain must be emphasized in all accounting and auditing organizations. Managers should forge a plan that takes advantage of employees' skills, competencies and talent, implementing forward-looking company procedures and actively deciding how to navigate workplace dynamics, personalities and responsibilities.
Research limitations/implications
The main limitations of the study refer to the infancy of the BT and require the development of knowledge through future studies to allow a more accurate outline of the overall picture and a detailed one of the BT phenomena with applicability to accounting and auditing. At this stage, it is not yet possible to fully envision the implications of BT on professional accounting and auditing organizations. However, there will be clients who adopt BTs, so firms should work with them to understand BT-based accounting and auditing applications. That is, accounting and auditing organizations should expand their skills and knowledge to anticipate and meet clients' needs.
Practical implications
In a constantly digitalizing world, the traditional accounting and educational environment is changing but not quickly enough to meet the requirements of a blockchain accounting system yet. For this reason, practical implications on the daily activities of the organizations and the restructuration of their internal architecture have been revealed in this paper.
Originality/value
The paper approaches blockchain using the lens of organizational change management with a specific focus on the accounting and audit organizations, and it proposes solutions to cope with the arising technological challenges. A challenge itself is the implementation of blockchain, especially when an entity is not ready for the process. Therefore, the SWOT analysis elaborated in this paper and focused on the accounting and auditing firms is an element of novelty and at the same time, a helpful tool highlighting the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this technology, supporting organizations in assessing how ready they are for its adoption. The research on blockchain in accountancy organizations is still necessary for at least seven key areas which have been proposed and detailed at the end of the paper, bringing in this way clarity in regards to the most endorsed avenues for future research directions.}

Drawing on Stiegler's theory of transindividuation, understood as the trans-formation of individuals, groups and technologies, and his emphasis on technology-mediated memory, we propose that varying types of accounting records cultivate different memory forms by fostering spatiotemporal projections which reshape the societal perception and comprehension of accounting. Our analysis relies on a comparison between two decentralized transaction recording systems similar in their operations, but which emerged in two different eras: blockchain and early double-entry bookkeeping. Our approach draws from Haydu (1998) to identify similarities and contrasts between different periods which can emphasize the uniqueness of each, while conceptualizing long-term trends. By juxtaposing DEB and BC as instances of decentralized records, the study postulates a critical shift in accounting's transindividuation over time. We argue that while DEB's norms of recording aided in the formation of collective memory and long-term projections, turning records into objects of social investment, BC's recording, propelled by automation and an economic emphasis, manifests as an isolated numerical sequence hindering the scope of human projections. We posit that compared to early DEB, BC recording, although it holds the potential for democratization, may lead to divisions between users, among themselves, and with their records. We discuss the potential implications of this trans-dividuation process for notions of accountability, transparency, regulation, and the broader political role of accounting in society.}

To stay competitive, businesses must harness this data to make informed decisions that optimize their actions in response to the market. Business intelligence (BI) is an approach that enables organizations to leverage data-driven insights for better decision-making, but implementing BI comes with its own set of challenges. Accordingly, understanding the key factors that contribute to successful implementation is crucial. This study examines the factors affecting the implementation of BI projects by analyzing the interactions between these factors using system dynamics modeling. The research draws on interviews with five BI experts and a review of the background literature to identify effective implementation strategies. Specifically, the study compares traditional and self-service implementation approaches and simulates their respective impacts on organizational acceptance of BI. The results show that the two approaches were equally effective in generating organizational acceptance until the twenty-fifth month of implementation, after which the self-service strategy generated significantly higher levels of acceptance than the traditional strategy. In fact, after 60 months, the self-service approach was associated with a 30% increase in organizational acceptance over the traditional approach. The paper also provides recommendations for increasing the acceptance of BI in both implementation strategies. Overall, this study underscores the importance of identifying and addressing key factors that impact BI implementation success, offering practical guidance to organizations seeking to leverage the power of BI in today's competitive business environment.}

Conventional monitoring methods lack real-time insights and secure data-sharing capabilities, necessitating innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.}

Within a corporate planning and control system, the production programme could be clearly defined at the central headquarters on the basis of the plans of the national sales organization and adjusted through direct feedback of market demands and sales results. The overall goal ‘just in time production’ was flanked by the principle ‘just in time information’ as a condition sine qua non. ‘Centralization or decentralization’ became a question of philosophy rather than of methods. Rule No. 1: As decentralized as possible, to allow flexibility, as centralized as necessary, to allow control. Rule No. 2: Informations are easier to handle and to transport than goods and materials.}

As of now, many people use it as a collective term for advanced technologies, i.e. advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, cloud computing, smart sensors, internet of things, augmented reality, etc. This substantially improves flexibility, quality, productivity, cost, and customer satisfaction by transforming existing centralized manufacturing systems towards digital and decentralized one. Despite having potential benefits of industry 4.0, the organizations are facing typical obstacles and challenges in adopting new technologies and successful implementation in their business models. This paper aims to identify potential barriers which may hinder the implementation of industry 4.0 in manufacturing organizations. The identified barriers, through comprehensive literature review and on the basis of opinions collected from industry experts, are: poor value-chain integration, cyber-security challenges, uncertainty about economic benefits, lack of adequate skills in workforce, high investment requirements, lack of infrastructure, jobs disruptions, challenges in data management and data quality, lack of secure standards and norms, and resistance to change. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) is used to establish relationships among these barriers to develop a hierarchical model and MICMAC analysis for further classification of identified barriers for better understanding. An analysis of driving and dependence of the barriers may help in clear understanding of these for successful implementation of Industry 4.0 practices in the organizations.}

Since the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions worldwide, rail transport has been revitalised gradually. However, the new normal emerges with unprecedented issues, such as changed travel behaviour, lost profits, and a lack of personnel. In this paper, we determine the arising challenges due to COVID-19 and pandemics in general and subsequently propose several solutions to tackle these challenges in rail transport. These solutions cover multidisciplinary aspects such as passenger demand management, freight demand management, service design, automation, decentralisation and advanced railway technologies. By reviewing the relevant literature on COVID-19, public transport and particularly rail transport, we synthesise and identify promising lines of research that should devote more attention to a more efficient, effective and sustainable rail transport service. This paper provides policymakers, researchers, railway infrastructure managers and undertakings with an overview and an outlook for the impacts of the pandemic crisis and similar situations. It supports decision-making with more evidence and facilitates rail transport to restore its performance and reach its societal goal.}

We argue that cooperative knowledge processing technology can contribute to dissolve this conflict. For this purpose, we introduce the reader into the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. On that basis we then develop the concept of Agent oriEnted orGanISations (AEGIS), in order to support the flexible modeling and management of business processes in decentralized organizational settings. Applying to methods of Distributed Planning a set of process modeling and process interaction operators is defined. These operators also permit to automatically create and customize computerized configurations of business processes.

Therefore, this paper aims to propose an agent-based secure decentralized innovative digital health passport protocol that is interoperable, fault-tolerant, and compatible with privacy standards. The proposed solution is known as Secure Mobile Digital Passport Agent (SMDPA), uses: (1) Private Set Intersection (PSI) to (a) protect Digital Health Passport Information (DHPA) against surveillance, especially during the crisis, (b) generate Bit Passing Coin (BPC); (2) blockchain to store serialized SMDPAs copies (3) mobile agent to disseminate DHPA autonomously; (4) Location and time attributes for data minimization.

However, due to the involvement of multiple industrial sectors, a large number of related parties, and the complexity of environmental information flows in the whole lifecycle of buildings, the effectiveness of the traditional centralized management approach is limited, and it is necessary to adopt more advanced management technology tools. With its decentralized, transparent, and secure characteristics, blockchain technology has triggered various applications in several industries, as well as in the field of building environmental sustainability. Using bibliometric and content analysis, this paper comprehensively reviews the current state of research on blockchain technology in the field of building environmental sustainability. A total of 128 articles were reviewed, revealing that blockchain technology has been used to address various types of environmental problems in multiple stages of the building lifecycle, including building material production, construction, operation, and demolition phases, etc. It is shown that blockchain technology can already effectively improve the use of renewable energy and reduce overall energy consumption during the building operation phase, while the great potential for solving other environmental issues, such as the management of building embodied carbon emissions, needs to be further explored. This paper also explores potential research opportunities and future directions based on current gaps and limitations, presenting several critical topics from the perspective of building lifecycle and practice support. This review helps related researchers gain insights into the research frontier and future direction.}

Digital Twins provide information about and services based on their physical counterpart’s current condition, history and predicted future. They are the building blocks of a vision of future Digital Factories where stakeholders collaborate via the information Digital Twins provide about physical assets in the factory and throughout the product lifecycle. Digital Twins may also contribute to more flexible and resilient Digital Factories. To achieve this, Digital Twins will need to evolve from today’s expert-centric tools towards active entities which extend the capabilities of their physical counterparts. Required features include sensing and processing their environment and situation, pro-actively communicating with each other, taking decisions towards their own or cooperative goals, and adapting themselves and their physical counterparts to achieve those goals. Future Digital Twins will need to be context-aware, autonomous, and adaptive. This paper aims to establish a roadmap for this evolution. It sets the scene by proposing a working definition of Digital Twins and examines the state-of-the-art in the three topics in their relation to DTs. It then elaborates potentials for each topic mapped against the working definition, to finally identify research gaps allowing for the definition of a roadmap towards the full realisation of autonomous, context-aware, adaptive Digital Twins as building blocks of tomorrow’s Digital Factories.}

abstract = {A key driver to ofering smart services is an infrastructure of Cyber-Physical systems (CPS)s. By definition, CPSs are intertwined physical and computational components that integrate physical behaviour with computation. The reason is to autonomously execute a task or a set of tasks providing a service or a list of end-users services. In real-life applications, CPSs operate in dynamically changing surroundings characterized by unexpected or unpredictable situations. Such operations involve complex interactions between multiple intelligent agents in a highly non-stationary environment. For safety reasons, a CPS should withstand a certain amount of disruption and exert the operations in a stable and robust manner when performing complex tasks. Recent advances in reinforcement learning have proven suitable for enabling multi-agents to robustly adapt to their environment, yet they often depend on a massive amount of training data and experiences. In these cases, robustness analysis outlines necessary components and specifications in a framework, ensuring reliable and stable behaviour while considering the dynamicity of the environment. This paper presents a combination of multi-agent reinforcement learning with robustness analysis shaping a cyber-physical system infrastructure that reasons robustly in a dynamically changing environment. The combination strengthens the reinforcement learning, increasing the reliability and flexibility of the system by applying robustness analysis. Robustness analysis identifies vulnerability issues when the system interacts within a dynamically changing environment. Based on this identification, when incorporated into the system, robustness analysis suggests robust solutions and actions rather than optimal ones provided by reinforcement learning alone. Results from the combination show that this infrastructure can enable reliable operations with the flexibility to adapt to the changing environment dynamics.}

The authors have developed a tracking system for car actions using the Blockchain system based on the Exonum platform. Mathematical foundations of this system are presented in the article. Data input and confirmation of their acceptance of the transaction is carried out using an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA security is related to the complexity of the private key search task described in the article. This largely relates to the management of large-scale systems, such as transport system. Failure to follow simple rules and recommendations can lead to serious consequences, such as road accidents and congestion. Therefore, the proposed system can assist in making decisions with autonomous cars and in investigating crimes as well as traffic offences.}

Today, the world of technology is highly dependent on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) and their applications. All these ML/DL models, which bring huge benefits and provide Industry 4.0 solutions, require a bulk of data, extensive computational power, and storage for enhanced performance and accuracy. With the current jurisdictions on privacy all over the world, it is hard to access the required amount of data without giving the data ownership to the centralized silos. Taking model to the data source is the idea that makes Federated Learning (FL) a unique and better-suited solution in this situation. In this paper, we present a review of FL, its learning models, aggregation algorithms, frameworks, and the challenges faced by this new paradigm of decentralized and distributed Machine Learning. We discuss the potential applications of FL in various domains that can help improve the efficiency and flexibility of industrial processes. We also talk about their impact on changing the model training trends altogether in terms of data privacy, decentralization, security, and resource management. The main contribution of this work is to provide a comprehensive and concise review and comparative analysis of various frameworks and aggregation algorithms, followed by a discussion of challenges currently faced by FL.}

Researchers have shown a surprising interest in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities in recent years. By providing a variety of intelligent applications, such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, and smart financing, smart cities (SC) can improve the quality of life for their residents. Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.}

Such datasets often include sensitive information, yet most recommender systems are focusing on the models’ accuracy and ignore issues related to security and the users’ privacy. Despite the efforts to overcome these problems using different risk reduction techniques, none of them has been completely successful in ensuring cryptographic security and protection of the users’ private information. To bridge this gap, the blockchain technology is presented as a promising strategy to promote security and privacy preservation in recommender systems, not only because of its security and privacy salient features, but also due to its resilience, adaptability, fault tolerance and trust characteristics. This paper presents a holistic review of blockchain-based recommender systems covering challenges, open issues and solutions. Accordingly, a well-designed taxonomy is introduced to describe the security and privacy challenges, overview existing frameworks and discuss their applications and benefits when using blockchain before indicating opportunities for future research.}

While the recent empirical literature has focused on the relative importance of technical change and globalization as the main drivers of job polarization, the role of within firm organizational changes has remained unexplored. Our study contributes to filling this gap by investigating how technological and organizational changes affect the mix of jobs within the firm. To this end we merge two firm level surveys from Denmark and add registry data to gain detailed knowledge of changes in the firms’ occupational structure. We construct measures of work organization in line with previous research and using a translog model we show that changes in work organization are associated with polarization by substituting and complementing different skill groups, even in the absence of technological change and changes in offshoring. The results show not only that the organizational level is central to understanding possible trends towards job polarization, but also demonstrate that changes in work organization often co-occur with changes in technology and in offshoring behavior, leading to interactions effects between organizational change, and technology and offshoring on job polarization.}

Relevant policies and regulatory provisions were evaluated against the proposed policy solutions and universal energy access programs. This research context was chosen to expound upon the potential benefits of distributed generation using renewable energy, and to link them to the following objectives – to (i) improve health and prospects for self-determined wellbeing at the community level, (ii) re-think the ecological footprint of local and regional energy infrastructure, and (iii) support climate and sustainability agendas primarily at local and regional levels. The energy system design approach speaks to the market gap that currently exists in the deployment of context-specific, culturally and ecologically-informed distributed-energy systems, with opportunities for local involvement in an independent, decentralized energy generation and management.

However, how it affects logistics and production over the past years as well as what should be examined next remain unclear. This paper fills this gap by first discussing the evolution of blockchain (from Blockchain 1.0 to Blockchain 5.0). Then, we examine the related production and logistics management literature and highlight the current states of knowledge in the field. We review in more details the analytical and empirical studies and uncover the research methods, topics, insights and implications. After that, with references to both the examined literature and observed industrial practices, we identify various important research gaps one by one. We build the intra-inter-organizational (IIO) operational framework to highlight the importance of both internal (i.e., intra-organizational level) and inter-organizational considerations in order to adopt blockchain successfully in production and logistics systems. Critical factors for implementing blockchain under the IIO framework are uncovered. Finally, based on the IIO framework, a future research agenda, which relates to the different stages of blockchain development as well as different topical areas, is established.}

Order picking is still performed manually by human operators in most companies; however, there are also increasingly more technologies available to automate order picking processes or to support human order pickers. One concept that has not attracted much research attention so far is hybrid order picking where autonomous robots and human order pickers work together in warehouses within a shared workspace for a joint target. This study presents a simulation model that considers various system characteristics and parameters of hybrid order picking systems, such as picker blocking, to evaluate the performance of such systems. Our results show that hybrid order picking is generally capable of improving pure manual or automated order picking operations in terms of throughput and total costs. Based on the simulation results, promising future research potentials are discussed.}

This dynamic landscape is characterized by a myriad of innovative solutions, ranging from decentralized finance and supply chain management to digital identity and voting systems, each contributing to the ongoing advancement and adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors. Achieving interoperability among these applications and platforms poses a significant challenge due to their use of distinct protocols, and remains a bottleneck hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. Addressing this challenge requires designing a universal interoperability protocol while ensuring compliance with the security and privacy constraints specific to each blockchain, thus adding complexity. We propose an agnostic interoperability protocol designed for seamless asset movement across independent private blockchain networks, regardless of their individual protocols. This protocol leverages incentive-driven smart contract and Zero-Knowledge Proofs to establish a decentralized, secure, and privacy-focused framework for interoperability. We conduct a security analysis using game theory and provide both theoretical and empirical evaluations of the protocol end-to-end delay. Through a comprehensive use case, we demonstrate the secure deployment of the proposed protocol for asset movement between two private blockchains. We also discuss the trade-offs between cost and delay in cross-blockchain transactions. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing interoperability schemes showcases the proposed interoperability scheme superiority in terms of robustness, privacy preservation, and verifiability.}

Then, the implementations of blockchain technology in power systems are divided into various categories, such as demand response (DR), EVs, decentralized energy management, energy trading and distributed renewable energy. A detailed literature analysis is conducted by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in a systematic approach using credible and reliable database systems such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Scopus to highlight current advancements in blockchain technology uses in electric energy systems particularly in DR, as well as future potential and existing problems. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part lists the important publications that have delved into the implementation of Blockchain in demand response. Trends of Blockchain applications in other electric energy system areas are detailed in the second section. The final part highlights the evolution and advancement of blockchain-based electric energy systems including favourable attributes of structures and designs, as well as the challenges and future trends.}

First introduced in 2008 as the technology behind the digital currency Bitcoin, blockchain has now found use in a wide range of sectors. Modern agriculture supply networks have emerged to accommodate intricate interactions between regional actors and the agricultural environment. Interactions between various participants in the supply chain, including those involved in manufacturing, processing, and delivery. One of the main reasons fraud happens so often in agriculture is the lack of transparency in the supply chain. Businesses that aren’t transparent run the risk of losing money, alienating their customers, and seeing their brands decline in value. To encourage the growth of an efficient and trustworthy trading environment, several fundamental adjustments to the current supply chain architecture are necessary. The potential for blockchain technology to enhance food and agricultural supply chain transparency is well acknowledged. Companies utilize IoT and blockchain to create more equitable, sustainable, and customer-friendly food manufacturing systems. In this current work, a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp), ‘ASBlock’, is developed for agricultural-based supply chain management. The primary focus of this developed application is to bring transparency and security to all participating users of the application; the users of this application include farmers or producers, suppliers or retailers, hotels, and end users. The performance analysis shows that the average gas utilization of the proposed ASBlock dApp is ∼ 2.8 ⋆ 104. The average smart contract execution time for all use cases is ∼ 112sec.}

To fulfill the demand for edge computing, the requirement for intelligent high-end embedded systems, together with an operating system, for future production has grown. After a series of recent publications describing the basic principles of the necessary information technology networking of biological and technical systems, we introduce the concept of a biointelligent, embedded system, discuss its need for an operating system and place it in a larger system context. By comparing the use of embedded operating systems in digital product systems, necessities of an operating system in biointelligent systems are derived, e.g. managing resources, guaranteeing real-time processing, mastering complexity, ensuring usability and increasing security. Upon the evaluation of the fulfillment of existing embedded operating systems to these necessities, we derive white spots for future research.}

Interestingly, future power systems will only be considerably affected by these Giga Trends, but also play a key role to further the mentioned Giga Trends. We believe that the 5D Giga Trends will result in some new characteristics for the future power systems in such a way that the existing approaches will not be sufficient to tackle the upcoming issues. As a result, understanding the power system transformation strongly depends on investigating the impacts of the 5D Giga Trends. It is anticipated that a tsunami of disruptions will happen in the future power systems due to these 5D Giga Trends along with the introduction of innovative technologies. This chapter addresses the role of the aforementioned global trends in the future power system, investigates the challenges faced by the existing power systems, and the opportunities due to the emergence of the Giga Trends in power systems are highlighted.}

abstract = {In order to increase the level of global competitiveness and improve the performance of production system, a large number of manufacturing companies have implemented world class manufacturing (WCM) approach, which has developed based on the third industrial revolution and the need for mass production. The evolution in production equipment and communication technologies, and the demand of markets for personalized mass production, have forced manufacturing companies to transform their production systems and prepare for a revolution. This revolution, known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0), or the digital transformation, has been introduced as a new type of organization of manufacturing systems that is more flexible and agile, and is based on using large amounts of information and data in the decision-making process. One of the main characteristics of this concept is decentralization, which allows different subsystems to make decisions autonomously in order to have self-organization systems. There are some important differences between the principles of WCM and I4.0. World class manufacturing is mainly based on continuous improvement and cost reduction, without a global vision for profit optimization. Industry 4.0 is mainly based on using all accessible information and data of systems and making decentralized decisions, but it also involves a global vision and a systemic approach to global profit optimization. However, achieving these objectives takes a very long time, and the challenges are numerous. As with all projects, for a transformation project to succeed, it is very important to define the transition phase and the way to change and introduce these new principles. This paper presents part of our research project, in collaboration with the Fiat Powertrain Technologies company, concerning the transformation of their production system toward the factory of the future. We highlight the design principles of I4.0 and the potential of the WCM system for transformation and achieving development of the characteristics of I4.0. We focus on five of the principal technical pillars of WCM and the steps in their development, and present some modifications in adoption of the design principles of I4.0. An example of change in the professional maintenance pillar of WCM is also presented.}
