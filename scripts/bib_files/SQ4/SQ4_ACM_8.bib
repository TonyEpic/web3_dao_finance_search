abstract = {Decentralised learning is attracting more and more interest because it embodies the principles of data minimisation and focused data collection, while favouring the transparency of purpose specification (i.e., the objective for which a model is built). Cloud-centric-only processing and deep learning are no longer strict necessities to train high-fidelity models; edge devices can actively participate in the decentralised learning process by exchanging meta-level information in place of raw data, thus paving the way for better privacy guarantees. In addition, these new possibilities can relieve the network backbone from unnecessary data transfer and allow it to meet strict low-latency requirements by leveraging on-device model inference. This survey provides a detailed and up-to-date overview of the most recent contributions available in the state-of-the-art decentralised learning literature. In particular, it originally provides the reader audience with a clear presentation of the peculiarities of federated settings, with a novel taxonomy of decentralised learning approaches, and with a detailed description of the most relevant and specific system-level contributions of the surveyed solutions for privacy, communication efficiency, non-IIDness, device heterogeneity, and poisoning defense.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the concept of blockchain soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their implementation in Ethereum-based blockchains. Soulbound tokens add an important piece to blockchain technology, as they could be the key to building Web3 and a trustworthy decentralized society. Issued and strictly linked to an account, representing the soul of a user, the soulbound token makes it possible to represent a property that only the user can have and that cannot be transferred, but only removed, which enhances security. To evaluate their impact on blockchain development, we first examine the concept of soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their effective adoption. The application sectors include the creation of digital identity certificates, ownership certificates, reputational certificates, governance, and the healthcare sector. We then report and describe relevant blockchain token standards, including soulbound token standards, provided in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Finally, to study the efficacy of the implementation of soulbound tokens, we propose a case study that includes the design and development of a decentralized vaccine certification prototype based on soulbound tokens. In our system, the vaccination data produced by the health authority is fully decentralized and implemented as the issuance of soulbound tokens for the benefit of a citizen's soul account. As a result, the citizen is the only owner of the vaccination data.},

abstract = {Agriculture is the lifeline of Indian economy which contributes to 22\% of the GDP, provides 58\% employment, and sustains 69\% of the population. However, agricultural production comes with various risk factors beyond human control. Farmers are highly exposed to risk and it is aggravated by the limited span of risk mitigation instruments such as insurance where there is a lack of participation from the private sector and the claim payout procedure is very lengthy, due to which the farmer cannot initiate new cropping activity or it is delayed. There is no proper and adequate provision of security for crops grown by Indian farmers and despite increasing vulnerability, they have not yet fully developed the capacity to mitigate risk effectively. There is a need to design innovative insurance products to balance the interests of the insurer as well as the insured. With the Prime Minister's call to be "self sufficient" or "aatmanirbhar", in this paper we present a decentralised peer-to-peer crop insurance framework which enables to overcome the current disadvantages by securing farmers' interests, eliminating intermediaries and providing a secure, standardized, and transparent system that does not hinder any information from stakeholders. Through blockchain technology, the system promotes trust in a trust less environment wherein the farmers and the private investors go into a contract. The investors pool their investments and provide cover for the farmers, thus help the nation become self sufficient and help the farmers prosper.},

This will raise the need to coordinate their movements in order to properly handle both access to shared resources (e.g., intersections and parking slots) and the execution of mobility tasks (e.g., platooning and ramp merging). The aim of this article is to provide a global view of the coordination issues and the related solutions in the field of autonomous vehicles. To this end, we firstly introduce the general problems associated with coordination of autonomous vehicles by identifying and framing the key classes of coordination problems. Then, we overview the different approaches that can be adopted to deal with such problems by classifying them in terms of the degree of autonomy in decision making that is left to autonomous vehicles during the coordination process. Finally, we overview some further research challenges to address before autonomous coordinated vehicles can safely hit our streets.},

abstract = {The non-fungible token (NFT) market has experienced significant growth in recent years. Similar to real estate and artwork, NFT is illiquid and it does not have a market price. Thus, there arises a need for a comprehensive scoring system to analyze the value of NFTs. Using a single score is often inadequate, as NFT value is influenced by numerous factors and is assessed based on personal objectives. Addressing the issue, this study explores critical factors influencing NFT value and develops three scores to rank NFTs including rarity, return on investment (ROI), and reputation score. The scores serve to evaluate both NFTs and NFT collections. (i) The rarity score evaluates the level of scarcity, and it applies to NFTs within a collection. (ii) The reputation score evaluates the interest of communities in NFT projects, considering the number of followers and the interaction rate; the score is for NFT collections. (iii) The ROI score assesses the profit generated by NFTs; it applies to both NFTs and NFT collections. Our empirical results show that a well-distributed rarity score of NFTs enhances their demand and profit; high-rarity NFTs are typically associated with a low number of sale transactions. NFT collections with high ROI and high reputation generally draw more attention and yield a positive return. In addition to the three scores, this paper presents a system to collect and process a huge amount of blockchain and social network data for NFT evaluation.},

abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

The article presents two alternative schemes for camera scheduling: Grid-Based Grouping (GBG) and Elevator-Based Planning (EBP). The camera control works with realistic 3D environments and considers many factors, including the direction of the subject’s movement and its location, distances from the cameras, occlusion, overall recognition probability so far, and the expected time to leave the site, as well as the movements of cameras and their capabilities and limitations. In addition, the article utilizes clustering to group subjects, thereby enabling the system to focus on the areas that are more densely populated. Moreover, it proposes a dynamic mechanism for controlling the pre-recording time spent on running the solution. Furthermore, it develops a parallel algorithm, allowing the most time-consuming phases to be parallelized, and thus run efficiently by the centralized parallel processing subsystem. We analyze through simulation the effectiveness of the overall solution, including the clustering approach, scheduling alternatives, dynamic mechanism, and parallel implementation in terms of overall recognition probability and the running time of the solution, considering the impacts of numerous parameters.},

Keeping in view the catastrophic destruction of this devastating virus, there is a must-need situation to maximize the use of existing healthcare technologies such as the healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT). In healthcare, patient wearable devices are widely recognized as a dormant technology with enormous capabilities to assess and combat various diseases, e.g., cough, seizure, temperature, heartbeat, and so on. As we know, in the H-IoT, patient-wearable devices are dispersed in an infrastructure-free environment that exposes them to several private and public coercion while accumulating and transmitting high sensitive data over the wireless communication channel. Therefore, security is the main concern of these applications, and thus, the primary focus of this article to outline the limitations and challenges in the present literature from 2019 to 2021, to identify the requirements of H-IoT applications used in the context of COVID-19. Following this, we will move one step ahead to explore the current security techniques adopted in these applications. Consequently, we will identify the network architectural, cryptographic, protocols, and operational security challenges during our study to recommend viable research directions and opportunities, which could be helpful and capable to minimize the network architecture, deployment, and maintenance cost with more productive outcomes.},

abstract = {This paper examines a method of clustering within a fully decentralized multi-agent system. Our goal is to group agents with similar objectives or data, as is done in traditional clustering. However, we add the additional constraint that agents must remain in place on a network, instead of first being collected into a centralized database. To do this we connect agents in a random network and have them search in a peer-to-peer fashion for other similar agents. We thus aim to tackle the basic clustering problem on an Internet scale and create a method by which agents themselves can be grouped, forming coalitions. In order to investigate the feasibility of a decentralized approach, this paper presents a number of simulation experiments involving agents representing two-dimensional points. A comparison between our method's clustering ability and that of the k-means clustering algorithm is presented. Generated data sets containing 2,500 to 160,000 points (agents) grouped in 25 to 1,600 clusters are examined. Results show that our decentralized agent method produces a better clustering than the centralized k-means algorithm, quickly placing 95\% to 99\% of points correctly. The the time required to find a clustering depends on the quality of solution required; a fairly good solution is quickly converged on, and then slowly improved. Overall, our experiments indicate that the time to find a particular quality of solution increases less than linearly with the number of agents.},

abstract = {As one of the most complex parts in manufacturing systems, scheduling plays an important role in the efficient allocation of resources to meet individual customization requirements. However, due to the uncertain disruptions (e.g., task arrival time, service breakdown duration) of manufacturing processes, how to respond to various dynamics in manufacturing to keep the scheduling process moving forward smoothly and efficiently is becoming a major challenge in dynamic manufacturing scheduling. To solve such a problem, a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to (1) accurately construct dynamic scheduling models that can represent both personalized customer needs and uncertain provider capabilities and (2) efficiently obtain a qualified schedule within a limited time. From these two perspectives, this article systemically makes a state-of-the-art literature survey on the application of these artificial intelligence techniques in dynamic manufacturing modeling and scheduling. It first introduces two types of dynamic scheduling problems that consider service- and task-related disruptions in the manufacturing process, respectively, followed by a bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence techniques for dynamic manufacturing scheduling. Next, various kinds of artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers for solving dynamic scheduling problems including both directed heuristics and autonomous learning methods are reviewed, which strive not only to quickly obtain optimized solutions but also to effectively achieve the adaption to dynamics. Finally, this article further elaborates on the future opportunities and challenges of using artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers to solve complex dynamic scheduling problems. In summary, this survey aims to present a thorough and organized overview of artificial-intelligence-enabled dynamic manufacturing scheduling and shed light on some related research directions that are worth studying in the future.},

In a joint R&amp;D project, Egemin and the AgentWise research group are developing an innovative version of the E'GVs control system aimed to cope with new and future system requirements such as flexibility and openness.In this project, we exploit principles and mechanisms known from situated multi-agent systems for modelling and implementing a decentralized control system. Instead of a centralistic approach, where one computer system is in charge of numerous complex and time-consuming tasks (such as routing, collision avoidance, deadlock avoidance, etc.), we aim to provide the E'GVs with a considerable amount of autonomy. This allows to obtain a system that is far more flexible than the current software - the E'GVs adapt themselves to the current situation in their direct vicinity, order assignment is dynamic, the system can cope with E'GVs leaving the system (e.g. for maintenance) or adding new E'GVs, and so on.In this paper, we describe the architecture that is employed for implementing the control of the E'GV system.

abstract = {In this paper we describe and evaluate a fully distributed P2P evolutionary algorithm (EA) with adaptive autonomous selection. Autonomous selection means that decisions regarding survival and reproduction are taken by the individuals themselves independently, without any central control.This allows for a fully distributed EA, where not only reproduction (crossover and mutation) but also selection is performed at local level. An unwanted consequence of adding and removing individuals in a non-synchronized manner is that the population size gets out of control too. This problem is resolved by addingan adaptation mechanism allowing individuals to regulate their own selection pressure. The key tothis is a gossiping algorithm that enables individuals to maintain estimates on the size andthe fitness of the population. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated on a test problem to show the viability of the idea and to gain insight into the run-time dynamics of such an algorithm. The results convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of a fully decentralized EA in which the population size can be kept stable.},

These drivers are creating changes in all parts of the IT organization: structure and roles, application development, technology architectures, and skills and knowledge of IT practitioners. According to CIOs, their virtual, global IT organizations need to move even closer towards the strategic centre of the company, requiring increased business knowledge, improved ability to influence and negotiate, and a renewed focus on standardized architectures, metrics, and value creation.},

abstract = {IoT systems grow quickly and are massively present in urban areas. Their successful deployment requires autonomy that can be built on automated learning technologies such as Deep Learning. The IoT applications require important computational resources, rarely available on devices. Autonomous IoT systems require the computation power available on the edge and cloud servers in order to offload some tasks related to the supported applications and the underlying platforms. Task offloading constitutes a big challenge in autonomous IoT systems due to the huge number of IoT devices for scenarios of the family of smart cities. Managing task offloading in such contexts requires adaptive strategies capable of taking into consideration the rapid evolution of available resources and proposing efficient offloading solutions to all received requests. In this paper we use a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach capable of handling large state spaces, and resolve the optimization problem in this context, where other techniques can not scale efficiently. Our solution is based on a DRL agent that was developed in the ns3-gym framework and was tested on IoT system scenario implemented in the NS3 simulator. The results obtained show that the DRL agent can adapt quickly to resource evolution in the IoT system and can handle big number of demands fulfilling scalabilty requirements of autonomous IoT systems.},

abstract = {The Decentralised Web (DW) has recently seen a renewed momentum, with a number of DW platforms like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Hubzilla gaining increasing traction. These offer alternatives to traditional social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, by enabling the operation of web infrastructure and services without centralised ownership or control. Although their services differ greatly, modern DW platforms mostly rely on two key innovations: first, their open source software allows anybody to setup independent servers ("instances") that people can sign-up to and use within a local community; and second, they build on top of federation protocols so that instances can mesh together, in a peer-to-peer fashion, to offer a globally integrated platform.In this paper, we present a measurement-driven exploration of these two innovations, using a popular DW microblogging platform (Mastodon) as a case study. We focus on identifying key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to decentralise the web, and empirically highlight a number of properties that are creating natural pressures towards re-centralisation. Finally, our measurements shed light on the behaviour of both administrators (i.e., people setting up instances) and regular users who sign-up to the platforms, also discussing a few techniques that may address some of the issues observed.},

Data Theft, Flooding, Fuzzing, Hijacking, Malware Spoofing and Advanced Persistent Threats have been immensely growing attack that leads to end-user conflict by abolishing trust on autonomous vehicle. Looking after those sensitive data that contributes to measure the localisation factors of the vehicle, conventional centralised techniques can be misused to update the legitimate vehicular status maliciously. As investigated, the existing centralized false data detection approach based on state and likelihood estimation has a reprehensible trade-off in terms of accuracy, trust, cost, and efficiency. Blockchain with Fuzzy-logic Intelligence has shown its potential to solve localisation issues, trust and false data detection challenges encountered by today’s autonomous vehicular system. The proposed Blockchain-based fuzzy solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and reputation preservation technique. The illustrated proposed model filters false and anomalous data based on the vehicles’ rules and behaviours. Besides improving the detection accuracy and eliminating the single point of failure, the contributions include appropriating fuzzy AI functions within the Road-side Unit node before authorizing status data by a Blockchain network. Finally, thorough experimental evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.},

abstract = {Resource pools are collections of computational resources (e.g., servers) which can be used by different applications in a shared way. A crucial aspect in these pools is to allocate resources so as to ensure their proper usage, taking into account workload and specific requirements of each application. An interesting approach, in this context, is to allocate the resources in the best possible way, aiming at optimal resource usage. Workload, however, varies over time, and in turn, resource demands will vary too. To ensure that optimal resource usage is always in place, resource shares should be defined dynamically and over time. It has been claimed that utility functions are the main tool for enabling such self-optimizing behavior. Whereas many solutions with this characteristic have been proposed to date, none of them presents true decentralization within the context of shared pools. In this article, we then propose a decentralized model for optimal resource usage in shared resource pools, providing practical and theoretical evidence of its feasibility.},

Clustering analysis can be used to find patterns and trends in system operational data, as well as highlight deviations from these patterns. Such analysis can be essential for verifying the correctness and efficiency of the operation of the system, as well as for discovering specific situations of interest, such as anomalies or faults, that require appropriate management actions.This work analyzes the automated application of clustering for online system management, from the point of view of the suitability of different clustering approaches for the online analysis of system data in a distributed environment, with minimal prior knowledge and within a timeframe that allows the timely interpretation of and response to clustering results. For this purpose, we evaluate DOC (Decentralized Online Clustering), a clustering algorithm designed to support data analysis for autonomic management, and compare it to existing and widely used clustering algorithms. The comparative evaluations will show that DOC achieves a good balance in the trade-offs inherent in the challenges for this type of online management.},

abstract = {Information systems are nowadays developed and implemented in organizations flavored by changes in their environment and work practices. For information systems (IS) developers this is reflected in terms of changes in the information needs of users during the development phase, increased requests for adaptive maintenance and sometimes in abandonment of a systems as “useless for the current situation”. These issues are often not considered to be the responsibility of IS developers, or simply seen as unfortunate facts of life. This paper takes a different view. If the analyst is able to provoke discussion concerning changes in the user organization, s/he may not only be able to avoid the aforementioned difficulties, but may also be able to bring added value to the  organization by supporting desired changes through IS design. This type of thinking has already been adopted in many of the methods used in strategic IS planning. The method presented in this paper is meant to be used in the process of analyzing user requirements in an individual IS project. It also provides rough guidelines for choosing between alternative design options during systems development. The method is illustrated in use by descriptions of three action research projects. In each project the role of IS in relation to changes in the user organization was analyzed, and advice was given on the client's specific IS problems. The advice was both understood and accepted by decision makers in each client organization.},

abstract = {The proliferation of semiconductor-based nonlinear devices in power systems has caused serious concern over power quality issue. This paper proposes a decentralized control strategy for multiple active front-ends (AFEs) so that harmonic currents as well as reactive power generated by the nonlinear load can be compensated. Under the proposed control strategy, each active front-end autonomously decides its share in power quality improvement task, which is bounded by converter power rating and dynamically adjusted by the machine loading condition. The harmonic currents and reactive power uncompensated by an active front-end will be left for other units on its source side to compensate. In this way, the overall power quality improvement task can be automatically distributed to multiple active front-ends without communications. In order to verify the proposed control strategy, theoretical analysis is fully carried out and detailed simulation studies using switching-level converter models are performed.},

abstract = {Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to enable reliable, efficient, and intelligent transportation systems. Most motion-planning algorithms for multi-agent systems implicitly assume that all vehicles/agents will execute the expected plan with a small error and evaluate their safety constraints based on this fact. This assumption, however, is hard to keep for CAVs since they may have to change their plan (e.g., to yield to another vehicle) or are forced to stop (e.g., a CAV may break down). While it is desired that a CAV never gets involved in an accident, it may be hit by other vehicles and, sometimes, preventing the accident is impossible (e.g., getting hit from behind while waiting at a red light). Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) is a set of safety rules that defines the objective of CAVs to blame, instead of safety. Thus, instead of developing a CAV algorithm that will avoid any accident, it ensures that the ego vehicle will not be blamed for any accident it is a part of. Original RSS rules, however, are hard to evaluate for merge, intersection, and unstructured road scenarios, plus RSS rules do not prevent deadlock situations among vehicles. In this article, we propose a new formulation for RSS rules that can be applied to any driving scenario. We integrate the proposed RSS rules with the CAV’s motion planning algorithm to enable cooperative driving of CAVs. We use Control Barrier Functions to enforce safety constraints and compute the energy optimal trajectory for the ego CAV. Finally, to ensure liveness, our approach detects and resolves deadlocks in a decentralized manner. We have conducted different experiments to verify that the ego CAV does not cause an accident no matter when other CAVs slow down or stop. We also showcase our deadlock detection and resolution mechanism using our simulator. Finally, we compare the average velocity and fuel consumption of vehicles when they drive autonomously with the case that they are autonomous and connected.},

abstract = {This study examines software metrics in decentralized applications (dApps) to analyze their structural and behavioral characteristics as they grow in complexity. Sixty dApps were categorized into Small (3 to 29 contracts), Medium (30 to 46 contracts), and Large (47 to 206 contracts) based on their contract count. Initial analysis showed a non-normal data distribution, leading to the use of Spearman's correlation method. Findings revealed that Medium dApps have strong correlations between metrics like 'Average Local Variables' and 'Maximum Local Variables', while Large dApps show higher correlations between 'Number of Functions' and 'State Variable Count', indicating more complex contract structures. The higher Coupling Between Objects (CBO) in large dApps suggests increased interactions with other contracts or libraries, potentially elevating security risks. These insights are valuable for developers and stakeholders in the blockchain and IoT sectors, aiding in understanding how dApps evolve with increasing complexity and the implications on software metric relationships.},

The value, legitimacy, and utility of NFTs is disputed: proponents highlight revolutionary economic and cultural potentials of an open, secure, and immutable ownership database, while opponents are displeased by the environmental issues and abundant wrongdoing in the ecosystem. Nevertheless, the phenomenon is relevant to HCI, and signifies important developments for future interactive products. To better understand the NFT phenomenon, and to inform future HCI research and design, we investigated the stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem and relations between them. Based on open data we mined from the social news website Hacker News, we contribute the first data-backed model of stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem. The model reveals a nuanced account of the outlooks of creators, owners, and technologists; identifies investment firms and auction houses as arbiters of knowledge and value; and presents implications for future research.},

Meanwhile, the cooperation between teammates will improve efficiency. However, for current cooperative MARL methods, the cooperation team is constructed through either heuristics or end-to-end blackbox optimization. In order to improve the efficiency of cooperation and exploration, we propose a structured diversification emergence MARL framework named Rochico based on reinforced organization control and hierarchical consensus learning. Rochico first learns an adaptive grouping policy through the organization control module, which is established by independent multi-agent reinforcement learning. Further, the hierarchical consensus module based on the hierarchical intentions with consensus constraint is introduced after team formation. Simultaneously, utilizing the hierarchical consensus module and a self-supervised intrinsic reward enhanced decision module, the proposed cooperative MARL algorithm Rochico can output the final diversified multi-agent cooperative policy.},

The concept of blockchain involves linking a series of transaction blocks together in a chain, with each block being encrypted and inaccessible to anyone who lacks unanimous agreement. BC is comprised of five core stages, but the focus of this paper is on BC 2.0, specifically smart contracts. Smart contracts are utilized to ensure appropriate access controls and the enforcement of contracts. Digital signatures are essential for transactions in smart contracts, and various signature algorithms are employed, including ECDSA and EdDSA. The research problem is to compare and contrast the levels of security offered by two digital signature algorithms, ECDSA and EdDSA, which are employed in smart contracts. The primary objective of this study is to determine which digital signature algorithm performs better in terms of security.},

abstract = {In a decentralized storage system, agents replicate each other’s data to increase availability. Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners’ availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents’ availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents’ matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running.We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an “adoption” mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents.},

Though scholarly works on the metaverse have exponentially increased in the past two years, a systematic investigation of the governance issue of the metaverse is still lacking. As an effort to contribute to this line of research, this paper conducts a comprehensive literature review of the pertinent literature on metaverse governance. Specifically, this paper reviews the scholarly insights on the importance of and difficulties in governing the metaverse, recaps researchers’ debate on the governance mode of the metaverse, and discusses five key issues in the metaverse governance, including increased surveillance risks, regulatory and legal issues, data management, ethical concerns, and implications for individuals. Based on insights gained from the literature review, this paper further summarizes the features of extant research on metaverse governance, identifies research gaps, and proposes future research directions.},
