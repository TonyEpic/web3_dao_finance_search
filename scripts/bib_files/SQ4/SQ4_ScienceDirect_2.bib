abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reshaping society's production methods and productivity, and also changing the paradigm of scientific research. Among them, the AI language model represented by ChatGPT has made great progress. Such large language models (LLMs) serve people in the form of AI-generated content (AIGC) and are widely used in consulting, healthcare, and education. However, it is difficult to guarantee the authenticity and reliability of AIGC learning data. In addition, there are also hidden dangers of privacy disclosure in distributed AI training. Moreover, the content generated by LLMs is difficult to identify and trace, and it is difficult to cross-platform mutual recognition. The above information security issues in the coming era of AI powered by LLMs will be infinitely amplified and affect everyone's life. Therefore, we consider empowering LLMs using blockchain technology with superior security features to propose a vision for trusted AI. This survey mainly introduces the motivation and technical route of blockchain for LLM (BC4LLM), including reliable learning corpus, secure training process, and identifiable generated content. Meanwhile, this survey also reviews the potential applications and future challenges, especially in the frontier communication networks field, including network resource allocation, dynamic spectrum sharing, and semantic communication. Based on the above work combined with the prospect of blockchain and LLMs, it is expected to help the early realization of trusted AI and provide guidance for the academic community.}

However, on the one hand, the inability to reach mutual trust between unfamiliar entities limits the collaboration of entities, and on the other hand, most of the profits in the industrial chain are grabbed by the dominant enterprises. In this paper, an information system for collaboration among business entities is developed based on blockchain, based on which a business model called Decentralized Industry Alliance (DIA) is proposed. Transactions and profit distribution in the DIA are executed by smart contracts, which enables unfamiliar entities to trust each other without relying on a third party. Any entity that voluntarily complies with the smart contracts automatically becomes a member of the DIA, thereby promoting the expansion of the industry scale. The smart contracts distribute profits according to each entity’s contribution to the alliance, so as to ensure the fairness of value distribution. A case about the alliance of elderly care industry is carried out, which shows that the DIA achieves rapid expansion on the premise of ensuring fairness. As a general business model in the web 3.0 era, the DIA can be referenced by other industries.}

Classical approaches configure WSNs statically which makes altering and re-configuring them dynamically a challenging task. To address this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could be integrated into WSNs. The utilization of AI systems holds the potential to enhance the efficient management of energy consumption, thereby preventing wastage and ensuring prolonged usage in WSN. This research investigates the application of AI, encompassing intelligent computing techniques such as Machine Learning, to promote sustainable energy practices, with a particular focus on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We explores various methodologies employed in AI, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning, within the context of existing practices. The primary objective is to provide insights for researchers seeking to comprehend recent advancements in employing AI for sustainable energy of WSNs. Additionally, the article addresses persistent challenges and issues that require attention and optimal solutions in this domain. As such, we provide an in-depth analysis of various recently proposed AI strategies (2007 to 2023) that have been applied to WSNs. The examined articles have been systematically arranged to enhance follow-through, clarity, and readability. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the (AI) techniques employed in WSNs.

Nevertheless, such efforts do not address construction applications. This research introduces a novel tailorable decentralized AI system that utilizes BT as a computing-oriented technology. The proposed system is developed as an inference engine while having a number of interesting features. First, the system validates and audits the decision-making process while sharing and recording the input data and the computed outcomes in a synchronized trusted manner. Second, the system allows the formation of distributed AI repository that can absorb and manage concurrent use-cases while targeting different scopes and covering diverse AI branches. Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data. A case study of estimating the construction cost for road projects is provided to illustrate the system’s workability and demonstrate its performance.}

Exogenous events such as cyber-attacks and their media coverage can strongly affect their supply and demand, adoption and usage, efficiency, and infrastructural development, thus influencing their price stability and market valuation. Given the great technical complexity of blockchains, we believe that a pure economic analysis of risks associated with cryptocurrencies is simply not sufficient to convey the relationships between attacks and the disruptive effects that these can bring on the operation of cryptocurrencies. On these grounds, we survey the most common types of attacks for Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies and evaluate their impact on the returns of a number of real-world cryptocurrencies for which market data are available. Due to data availability, our event study analysis focuses on instances of 51% attacks, hard forks, and wallet attacks. The main goal of our analysis is to understand the relationship between technical events (cyber-attacks and coordinated user/miner behavior) and the economic impacts surrounding them. We aim to develop a deeper understanding of these systems that are objects of great research interest in separate disciplines, supporting policymakers in their regulatory decisions concerning crypto-assets and associated cyber-related financial risks.}

Toolkits are an organizational design solution to an innovation problem with sticky and local information. Our aim is to explore how toolkits theory applies to Web3 innovation, proposing that Web3 innovation is being organized through toolkits (e.g., blockchains, token standards, DAO frameworks) that enable efficient organization of sticky information to facilitate innovation. The contribution of this paper is the first application of toolkits theory to Web3, reframing its development as a problem of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of distributed information. We provide implications for the role of developers as user innovators, the economic problem of emergent toolkit stacking, and the design of toolkit business models.}

abstract = {Wogonin (WOG) has been demonstrated to have anti-cancer activity, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, new targets of WOG were predicted for lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colon cancer by using bioinformatics methods. WOG might primarily suppress cancers via regulating arachidonic acid, Ras, MAPK, linoleic acid, PI3K-Akt, and folate biosynthesis pathways. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay showed that WOG inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) results indicated that anti-lung cancer effect of WOG was achieved by regulating the expression of 18 target genes, including AKR1B10, AKR1C3, BDNF, CAV1, CXCL2, CYP2B6, CYP4F3, DAO, EGF, ENO3, IL6, PLA2G1B, PLA2G2F, PLA2G4A, PTGES, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and TFAP2A. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves further confirmed that DAO, PLA2G1B, SLCO1B3 and TFAP2A were essential targets via which WOG affected lung cancer survival. Moreover, BDNF, FGF2, and PTGS1 were predicted to be the targets via which WOG alleviated cancer proliferation and invasion in bladder cancer. As for colon cancer, WOG might induce autophagy and inhibit proliferation by down-regulating NTF4 and TH. The study will provide clue for using WOG as a promising antineoplastic agent in basic and translational research, and bring light to the application of herbs containing WOG as food supplements.}

Therefore, the possibilities of using blockchain for providing scalable management, efficient access, and accountability for the massive numbers of extant and emerging IoT devices merits investigation. In this study, we implement a blockchain-enabled IoT auditing management system complying with ISO/IEC 15408-2 requirements. The implemented system is operated with a stable data retrieval time, i.e. 25.74 to 26.77 microseconds, and a stable compressing and uploading time, i.e. 32.51 and 39.9 microseconds when handling and accessing below 100 logs. With more logs, the processing time raises in a proportional manner. The introduced auditing system represents an evolutionary paradigm not only possessing the advantageous characteristics of blockchain technology, i.e. de-centralization, robustness and tamper-resistance, but also fulfilling the critical requirements from ISO/IEC 15408-2 with respect to auditing perspective. Moreover, the scalability is guaranteed, as our proposed IoT auditing management system is suitable for versatile IoT-oriented application services (even on heterogeneous platforms).}

However, the quantification of several capabilities for smart manufacturing systems, such as decentralization, customization, interoperability, etc., is a matter of concern. The current research makes an attempt in this direction by questioning the need for this "multiplicity" of definitions and employs a methodical methodology to quantify the decentralization components to produce a coherent "blueprint" that justifies and integrates all of these many points of view. Further, a conceptual analysis of the model is made to discuss the alterations in the intelligence offerings with the enhancing implementation level of smart manufacturing systems. Based on the graphical analysis, the various level of organizational maturity with the enhancing smart manufacturing implementation is deliberated. The research provides significant directions to the managers to effectively plan, design, and execute the decentralization aspects with the increasing deployment level of smart manufacturing systems at a limited investment.}

This study has several contributions. It is among the first to investigate blockchain adoption in online advertising, and from a communication perspective. It extends the application of the ICTAM to a whole ecosystem perspective and identifies which factors are essential for successful blockchain adoption in online advertising. The study concludes that while blockchain technology is a promising solution to challenges afflicting online advertising, more education about blockchain’s potential, favourable regulation, and ready-to-use applications are needed before wide-scale adoption can be realised.}

The role of AI in industrial design, which is the practice of improving the function, value and aesthetics of products to optimise customer satisfaction, has not yet been extensively explored. To effectively synthesise the existing literature, an unsupervised learning-enabled review methodology is proposed in this study. Important journals and articles are identified by using k-means clustering, and the relevant articles are analysed by using co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrence analyses. Six clusters of the body of knowledge are then extracted, and naming of the clusters is assisted by using document summarisation and evaluation. Consequently, six intellectual cores related to AI in industrial design are formulated: (i) supply chain perspectives on product design and innovation, (ii) manufacturability and performance of new product development, (iii) intelligent tools and systems for industrial design and engineering, (iv) applied intelligence for product and service innovation, (v) industry 4.0 technologies for design and manufacturing, and (vi) blockchain-enabled artificial intelligence in industry 4.0.

abstract = {The metaverse is an emerging convergence of technologies (e.g., virtual reality and blockchains) that enables users to experience mixed/extended realities for various legitimate purposes (e.g., gaming, tourism, manufacturing and education). Unfortunately, the crime and security implications of emerging technologies are often overlooked. To anticipate crimes that the metaverse might facilitate, we report the findings of a nominal group technique (NGT) study, which involved a state-of-the-art scoping review of the existing literature and elicitation exercises with two groups of experts (one a diverse group from the UK and Europe, the other representing international law enforcement) with a wide range of expertise. A total of 30 crime threats were identified in the literature or by participants. The elicitation exercises also explored how harmful, frequent, achievable and defeatable participants anticipated that the crimes identified would be. Ratings for these aspects were largely consistent across the two samples, with crimes of a sexual nature (e.g., child sexual abuse material), and crimes against the person (e.g., hate crime) being rated as presenting the highest future risks (i.e. being high harm and high frequency) and being the most difficult to address. The findings illuminate understanding of the most (and least) harmful and likely crime threats the metaverse could facilitate and consequently help stakeholders to prioritise which offences to focus on. In discussing how the crime threats might be addressed, we consider roles and responsibilities and how theory about the management of physical places might inform crime prevention in the metaverse(s).}

We investigate business ventures leveraging blockchain technology to manage the intellectual property life cycle, in other words how intellectual properties are created, protected, managed and monetized. Our research method is a multiple case study examining a total of 120 use cases. across all primary types of intellectual properties including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, industrial design and geographical indications. The empirical validation is based on an in-depth within-case analysis of 26 applications which were selected from the initial 120 cases based on business maturity and popularity criteria. Our goal is to understand which intellectual property challenges distributed ledger technology is trying to solve and how. We also investigate which blockchain benefits, in terms of technological security, immutability, decentralization, tokenization or disintermediation are promoted by these applications. We triangulate our case study results using a PESTEL coding framework to better understand how the blockchain ecosystem manages the intellectual property life cycle and to provide scholarly researchers and practitioners with insights on how enterprises can use distributed ledger technology to enhance the management of the intellectual property value chain. Moreover, we validate theoretical findings through the evidence collected from our multiple case study analysis, and finally we provide strategic guidance in investigating the current and anticipated challenges of blockchain entrepreneurs to drive further distributed ledger innovation.}

This paper develops a taxonomy based on a comprehensive literature analysis to systematically structure this emerging field. The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.}

In this article, we demonstrate that contemporary financial reporting systems have the capacity to contribute significantly to the generation of innovation-relevant competitive intelligence. This potential arises because, as part of its regular work, the financial reporting system compiles, collects, analyzes, and synthesizes strategically relevant information about (i) complex internal technical processes related to inventions, discoveries, product development, process innovations, and the like; (ii) detailed sales, cost, and profit forecasts; (iii) consumer trends and innovative developments in the firm’s markets; (iv) actual and potential competitor actions in the market; and (v) regulatory changes, macro-economic trends, and information about the likely impact of government policies. We argue that this competitive intelligence can, if properly harnessed, lead to better informed discourses and decisions around innovation. Consequently, we highlight the potential—from both academic research and practical perspectives—of financial reporting as an enabler of innovation-relevant competitive intelligence embeddedness within firms.}

Open access eliminates the walled-garden approach; instead, it commoditizes communications network capacity while decentralizing access to a transparent wholesale market. It ensures that scarce capacity is put to its best use by providing a platform for efficient trade. The market operates without friction using flow trading. It allows participants to bid persistent piecewise-linear downward-sloping demand curves for portfolios of products, gradually adjusting positions toward targeted needs. Flow trading allows fine granularity of products in time and location, creating complete markets. Liquidity and computational feasibility are maintained despite trading millions of interrelated forward and real-time products. Participants manage risk and adverse price impact through trade-to-target strategies. The market operator clears the market every hour, finding unique prices and quantities that maximize as-bid social welfare. Prices, aggregate quantities, and the slope of the aggregate net demand are public. The market operator observes positions, enabling it to optimize collateral requirements to minimize default risk. Priority pricing is used to manage real-time imbalances. An application of the model is developed for intersatellite wholesale communications with optical (laser-beamed) mesh networks in space, showing several efficiency gains.}

Proximity Radio Access Network (P-RAN), which was proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), expands the cellular structure from base station to intelligent terminal equipment through device to device (D2D) technology, which provides a cost-effective deployment solution for the 5G and 6G. The extensive deployment of P-RAN solution should be based on the active participation of a large number of distributed intelligent equipment users. Fair, reasonable and credible incentive solution is the key to realize the sustainable operation of this distributed system. This paper introduces a technical solution that applying blockchain technology to design P-RAN operating and incentive mechanism. Through blockchain technology, the current centralized P-RAN operation and incentive can be achieved in point-to-point way. By utilizing blockchain-based identity authentication and asymmetric key pairs, user and relay can confirm and sign the network usage information in sequence to reduce disputes. The abstract of all transactions related to P-RAN services can be recorded on blockchain immutably as the calculation basis of relay rewards. Through smart contracts and P-RAN incentive policy, relays that provide more and higher quality P-RAN service will be rewarded more, which can help to create positive feedback in this decentralized system. The tokens awarded to relays will be able to exchange through the blockchain network for the increase of the whole ecosystem utility. Blockchain-based P-RAN operation and incentive solution pioneer a way to the future heterogeneous network resource sharing and collaboration for supporting Web3.0 and Metaverse.}

The underwater monitoring of the oceans and their surroundings is highly crucial from several perspectives, e.g., to unearth the hidden minerals/oils, to monitor the life of underwater species, military and rescue applications, surveillance of maritime borders, and predict tidal wave behaviors among others. The exploration and inspection activities of the underwater environment are mainly performed remotely by unmanned underwater vehicles or robots because human direct involvement in such a complex environment might not be a feasible option. Moreover, the recent maturity in digital automation and underwater drone technology along with the emergence and improvements in wireless, communication, and sensing technologies had already encouraged the research community to drive deep into this domain. Among several disruptive enabling technologies, Blockchain has emerged as a vital enabling technology to fulfil key requirements for secure data sharing, storage, process tracking, collaboration, and resource management. This study presents a comprehensive review of the utilization of Blockchain in different underwater applications, discussing various use cases along with detailing blockchain-based architectures, potential challenges, solutions, and future research directions. Potential challenges of underwater applications addressed by Blockchain have been detailed. This work identifies knowledge gaps between theoretical research and real-time Blockchain integration in realistic underwater drone applications.

abstract = {Drought stress is a major factor limiting agricultural development, and exogenous polyamines (PAs) can increase plant drought resistance by enhancing antioxidant activity, but few studies have examined whether endogenous PAs enhance the plant antioxidant system. Here, to investigate the effects of endogenous PAs on the antioxidant system of alfalfa under drought stress and the underlying mechanisms, two alfalfa cultivars, Longzhong (drought resistant) and Gannong No. 3 (drought sensitive), were used as test materials, and their seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) for 8 days at −1.2 MPa to simulate drought stress. The levels of free PAs [putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm)], hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), key PA metabolism enzyme [arginine decarboxylase (ADC), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), polyamine oxidase (PAO), and diamine oxidase (DAO)] activities, and antioxidant enzyme [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD)] activities were measured. These physiological indicators were used for correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between PA metabolism and the antioxidant enzyme system. The results showed that PA synthesis in alfalfa under drought stress was dominated by the ADC pathway. Spd and Spm played an important role in improving drought tolerance. The high levels of ADC and SAMDC activities were facilitated by the conversion of Put to Spd and Spm. H2O2 generation by oxidative decomposition of PAs was mainly dependent on the oxidative decomposition of DAO but not PAO. Low DAO activity favored low H2O2 production. Spd, Spm, ADC, ODC and SAMDC were positively correlated with the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and POD in both cultivars under drought. Therefore, we concluded that high ADC and SAMDC activities in alfalfa promoted the conversion of Put to Spd and Spm, leading to high accumulation of Spd and Spm and low Put accumulation. Low Put levels led to low H2O2 production through low DAO activity, and low H2O2 levels induced the expression of antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes to improve antioxidant enzyme activity and reduce MDA accumulation and thereby enhanced drought resistance in alfalfa.}

In this work, we concentrate on Decentraland and Sandbox, two well-known Metaverse applications in Web 3.0. Our experiments analyze, for the first time, the personal privacy data exposed by Metaverse applications and services from a combined perspective of network traffic and privacy policy. We develop a lightweight traffic processing approach suitable for the Web 3.0 environment, which doesn't rely on complex decryption or reverse engineering techniques. We propose a smart contract interaction traffic analysis method capable of retrieving user interactions with Metaverse applications and blockchain smart contracts. This method provides a new approach to de-anonymizing users' identities through Metaverse applications. Our system, METAseen, analyzes and compares network traffic with the privacy policies of Metaverse applications to identify controversial data collection practices. The consistency check experiment reveals that the data types exposed by Metaverse applications include Personal Identifiable Information (PII), device information, and Metaverse-related data. By comparing the data flows observed in the network traffic with assertions made in the privacy regulations of the Metaverse service provider, we discovered that far more than 49% of the Metaverse data flows needed to be disclosed appropriately.}

In this study, the accumulation effect of PE-MPs in the intestine of large-scale loach (Paramisgurnus dabryanus) was explored by adding different concentrations of PE-MPs to the water, the destination of PE-MPs after breaking the intestinal barrier and the effects caused. The collected data showed that PE-MPs accumulation for 21d altered the histomorphology and antioxidant enzyme activity of the intestine, induced dysbiosis of the intestinal flora. 10 mg/L of PE-MPs induced a significant increase in the transcript levels of intestinal immunity factors in loach after 21d of exposure. Moreover, the levels of diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactic acid (D-Lac) in the gut and serum of loach were significantly increased after exposure to PE-MPs at all concentrations (1, 5, 10 mg/L). Subsequently, the presence of PE-MPs was detected in the blood, suggesting that the disruption of the intestinal multilayer barrier allowed PE-MPs to spill into the circulation. The accumulation of PE-MPs (1,5,10 mg/L) in the blood led to massive apoptosis and necrosis of blood cells and activated phagocytosis in response to PE-MPs invasion. To alleviate the damage, this study further exposure the effect of probiotics on PE-MPs treated loach by adding Leuconostoc mesenteroides DH (109 CFU/g) to the feed. The results showed that DH significantly increased the intestinal index and reduced the levels of DAO and D-Lac. To investigate the reason, we followed the PE-MPs in the intestine and blood of the loach and found that the number of PE-MPs particles was significantly reduced in the probiotic group, while the PE-MPs content in the feces was elevated. Thus, we concluded that DH reducing the accumulation of PE-MPs in the intestinal by increases fecal PE-MPs, which in turn mitigates the damage to the intestinal barrier caused by PE-MPs, and reduces the amount of PE-MPs in the blood. This work offers a robust analysis to understand the mechanisms of damage to the intestinal barrier by MPs and the fate of MPs after escaping the intestinal barrier and provide a new perspective on the application of probiotics in mitigating PE-MPs toxicity.}

We evaluated the effect of recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (rh-HGF) on intestinal adaptation in a rat model of short-bowel syndrome (SBS).
Methods
Sprague–Dawley rats underwent jugular vein catheterization for continuous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and 90 % small bowel resection. The animals were divided into 3 groups: TPN/SBS (control group, n = 7), TPN/SBS/intravenous recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (0.3 mg/kg/day) (HGF group, n = 7), and TPN/SBS/intravenous c-Met inhibitor (0.3 mg/kg/day) (anti-HGF group, n = 5). On day 7, rats were euthanized and histologically evaluated. Serum diamine oxidase (S-DAO) levels were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The nutrient transporter and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) receptor expression were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results
The jejunal and ileal villus heights were higher and the S-DAO concentrations significantly higher (p = 0.04) in the HGF group than in the control and anti-HGF groups. The sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 expression in the HGF group was significantly higher than in the control group and significantly suppressed in the anti-HGF group (p < 0.01). The peptide transporter 1 expression in the jejunum was higher in the HGF group than in the other groups and significantly suppressed in the anti-HGF group (p < 0.01). The GLP-2 receptor expression in the jejunum was higher in the HGF group than the other groups, and it was significantly suppressed in the anti-HGF group (p < 0.01). These jejunal results regarding nutrient transporter an GLP-2 receptor were not found in the ileum.
Conclusions
The administration of rh-HGF appears to be more effective in the jejunum than in the ileum.

The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel ‘Blockchain Agency Theory’ that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike.}

I first identify the main characteristics of NFTs, then define NFTE and discuss the related assumptions, and finally propose a conceptual framework for NFTE and investigate its enablers. I conclude by proposing NFTE as a novel domain of entrepreneurship theory and practice with extensive new research opportunities, and the plausibility of using NFT as an alternative mode of knowledge production in which scholars become “NFT creators.”}

However, the precise pathways by which they can reach such ambitious goals have yet to be identified. As costs of photovoltaics (PV), batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to keep falling, they can jointly play a key role for deep decarbonization. Here, we conduct a techno-economic analysis of a city-scale energy system with roof-top PV, batteries, and EVs for Kyoto City, Japan. We find that aggressive EV adoption and the use of EVs for electricity storage could help roof-top PV penetration in the city with substantially lower costs than just deploying PV and batteries alone or allowing EV to charge only. CO2 emissions from vehicle and electricity usage in the city could be reduced by 60–74% if the entire current car fleet is replaced by EVs while also reducing energy costs by 22–37% by 2030. The largest challenge of a city-wide “PV + EV” system (named as “Solar-EV city”) is its implementation. We explore how it could be realized in Kyoto through peer-to-peer (P2P) power trading/blockchain technology initially on a community scale as smart microgrids, then gradually expanding/converging into a city-wide. For the transition to decentralized power systems, citizen’s decision-making process is one of the keys to overcome social, institutional, and regulatory barriers.}

The wisdom of the crowd has been used to gather insights, ideas, and problems by using responses from large numbers of people. In this work, 189 different ANN architectures will be used instead of human agents, thus creating an ANN Crowd. This research explores the question “should every agent in the crowd has the same voice?” To answer this, this research aims to broadly understand the sensitivity of influencing factors (training set selection, nodes, layers, and architecture) in the performance of the ANN Crowd. This will then support refinement to achieve generalizability for the ANN Crowds. The specific focus of this paper is to explore the effect of the training set selection on prediction accuracy. To do this, four different scenarios are explored (2 inputs x 2 outputs). ANN Crowds are created for these scenarios with different product training configurations to test how the training set influences the predictions (k-fold = 10). Results show that training set selection has a statistical and practical influence on prediction accuracy. Analyzing the presence of edge cases in training sets and the effects of training targets suggests further influence of training set selection. Future work includes a deeper exploration of the influence of edge cases within the training sets. Building on this foundation, the members of the ANN Crowd (different architectures) will be studied for their influence on prediction performance.}

Oligodendrocyte dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, so understanding oligodendrocyte activation states would shed light on disease processes. We identify three distinct activation states of oligodendrocytes from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS): DA1 (disease-associated1, associated with immunogenic genes), DA2 (disease-associated2, associated with genes influencing survival), and IFN (associated with interferon response genes). Spatial analysis of disease-associated oligodendrocytes (DAOs) in the cuprizone model reveals that DA1 and DA2 are established outside of the lesion area during demyelination and that DA1 repopulates the lesion during remyelination. Independent meta-analysis of human single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets reveals that the transcriptional responses of MS oligodendrocytes share features with mouse models. In contrast, the oligodendrocyte activation signature observed in human AD is largely distinct from those observed in mice. This catalog of oligodendrocyte activation states (http://research-pub.gene.com/OligoLandscape/) will be important to understand disease progression and develop therapeutic interventions.}

Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition.}

abstract = {Producing CO2-foams in saline environments can be a great challenge in many industrial applications, since fast gas diffusion and reduction of electrical double layer promote fast coarsening and coalescence of bubbles. Amine oxides are zwitterionic surfactants that have been shown to improve foam stability by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, but have not been investigated for CO2-foams yet. This paper reports a study on the use of commercial alkyldimethylamine oxides (CxDAO) as foaming agents in brine for CO2-foams, based on the interactions present at the low pH imposed by the dissolution of the CO2 and the presence of salts. Despite the presence of salt and CO2 increased the protonation degree of amine oxide molecules, favoring hydrogen bonding, a significant improvement in foam stability was only observed when using the long chain surfactant (C14DAO). This behavior was attributed to the synergy between increased attractive hydrophobic interactions of alkyl chains and reduced repulsion among ionic surfactant heads, which led to formation of large surfactant aggregates in bulk, as demonstrated by the significant increase in viscosity of the aqueous phase. There was also a decrease in foam drainage and coarsening rates for the foams using C14DAO in brine, compared to results in deionized water, suggesting that formation of hydrogen bonds is not enough to arrest the destabilization in CO2-foams. Moreover, the linear rate of bubble growth obtained for these foams (∝ t) was higher than that reported for N2– or air-foams (∝ t1/2), likely due to the high solubility of CO2 in the aqueous phase, which accelerated the coarsening phenomena. The results of this work offer insight on the future design of foaming formulations for stabilizing CO2-foams in applications that require the use of high salinity brines, such as carbon sequestration and oil recovery.}

abstract = {Background
Shenfu (SF) injection, a traditional Chinese medication, would improve microcirculation in cardiogenic shock and infectious shock. This study was aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of the SF injection in gut ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury after severe hemorrhagic shock (SHS) and resuscitation. Furthermore, we also investigated the optimal adm？ inistration timing.
Methods
Twenty-four male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham group (sham, n = 6), Control group (n = 6), SF injection group (SF, n = 6), and Delayed Shenfu injection administration group (SF-delay, n = 6). In SHS and resuscitation model, rats were induced by blood draw to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 ± 5 mmHg within 1 h and then maintained for 40 min; HR, MAP ‘were recorded, microcirculation index [De Backer score, perfused small vessel density (PSVD), total vessel density (TVD), microcirculation flow index score (MFI), flow heterogeneity index (HI)] were analyzed. The blood gas index was detected, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), diamine oxidase (DAO), malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by ELISA; ZO-1, and claudin-1 were measured by Western blotting. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and periodic acid schiff (PAS) staining pathological sections of the intestinal mucosal tissues were also performed.
Results
SF injection increased the MAP, relieved the metabolic acidosis degree associated with the hypoperfusion, and improved the intestinal microcirculatory density and perfusion quality after I/R injury. The expression of DAO, MDA in intestinal tissue, and plasma IL-6, TNF-α significantly decreased in the SF injection group compared to the control group. The concentration of ZO-1 and claudin-1 is also higher in the SF injection group. In addition, the HE and PAS staining results also showed that SF injection could decrease mucosal damage and maintain the structure. In the SF-delay group, the degree of intestinal tissue damage was intermediate between that of the control group and SF injection group.
Conclusions
SF injection protect the intestine from I/R injury induced by SHS and resuscitation, the mechanism of which might be through improving intestinal microcirculation, reducing the excessive release of inflammatory factors and increasing intestinal mucosal permeability. Furthermore, the protection effect is more pronounced if administration during the initial resuscitation phase.}

Furthermore, the nanomedicines action mechanism in alleviating the disease process, reducing inflammation, and repairing mucosa has been determined. Zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) have been identified as valuable metallic nanoparticles that exhibit significant anti-inflammatory effects. In this particular experiment, green-formulated ZnNPs were created using sodium lignosulfonate. The characterization of these nanoparticles was conducted using various techniques such as Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). For the in vivo part of the study, adult Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups. The animals were administered ZnNPs (50 µg/kg) or salazosulfapyridine (175 mg/kg) before 5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solutions (0.75 g/kg) intragastric administration. The treatments were conducted for 1 week. Measurements were taken for macroscopic changes in the colon tissue, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratios, disease activity index (DAI), and food intake in 24 h. The levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in the serum were analyzed at 7 or 1 days. Additionally, the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), diamine oxidase (DAO), malonaldehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the colon tissue were measured at 7 days. Furthermore, the activation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in colon tissue was examined using Western blot and RT-PCR. In rats with acute enteritis, the administration of ZnNPs resulted in a significant reduction in DAI at 1 week after DSS treatment. Additionally, it led to an increase in body weight and food intake within 1 day at 3 or 6 days, as well as a decrease in the colon weight-to-dry weight ratio. ZnNPs also exhibited a reduction in IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in the serum, while increasing IL-10 levels at 7 days. Moreover, it reduced GSH-Px, DAO, MDA, and MPO efficacies in the colon. More investigations revealed that ZnNPs prevented significantly ICAM-1 and NF-κB levels in colon tissue. This research provides evidence that ZnNPs possess high protective efficacies on DSS-induced acute enteritis in animals by their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.}

abstract = {Scattered light damage (splash) is one of the common defects that can be observed from the stealth dicing process, and it is mainly due to the interaction of the pulsed laser beam with the micro-crack and modified layer formed. This might cause thermal damage on the active layer of the die and degrade the reliability and yield of the device. The development of new technology node for memory devices aims to reduce scribe width, thereby increasing the number of dies per wafer. The ongoing trend towards scribe width reduction from 120 μm to current sub-60 μm, results in increased throughput and decreased cost per die. Furthermore, this reduction allows for greater functionality integration within a confined space, thereby enhancing overall device performance. Hence, the elimination of splash during the SD process is imperative to enable further shrinking of scribe width. This paper focuses on the impact of pulse pitch and distance from 1st focal depth to silicon (Si) frontside on the maximum splash distance. Lower pulse pitch and lower distance from 1st focal depth to Si frontside will introduce higher splash distance. An empirical model for splash elimination was established to determine the critical distance from 1st focal depth to Si frontside as a function of pulse pitch.}

A total of 50 Holstein calves were enrolled. Thirty-six of the 50 calves presented diarrhea and were sub-classified by severity based on fecal status (0: firm, 1: pasty, 2: loose, and 3: watery) and blood pH (acidemia: blood pH <7.25) as follows: Seventeen calves exhibiting watery diarrhea and/or fall into acidemia were sub-categorized into the severe group. The other nineteen calves exhibiting pasty or loose diarrhea and not fall into acidemia were sub-categorized into the moderate group. The remaining 14 calves without diarrhea were assigned to the control group. The plasma DAO activity was significantly lower (p < .01) in the calves with severe or moderate diarrhea than in the control group. In addition, the plasma DAO activity was significantly lower (p < .05) in the severe group than in the moderate group. The relationship between plasma DAO activity and fecal score (r = −0.55, p < .01) in calves with diarrhea were found to have significantly and negatively correlated by Spearman's rank test in this study. Our results suggested that plasma DAO activity reflect the degree of intestinal mucosal disorder due to diarrhea.}

Yet the approach based on the ontological primacy of stable and often hierarchical structures is still prevalent in theoretical and, most importantly, practical thinking about social systems. We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing social system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it follows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of individuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive processes in the evolution of a system. The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system – an ecology of interacting social subsystems – each of which is also a living cognitive system. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work. We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research – distributed social governance – which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on stable structures within global society.}

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.}

In the form of Initial Coin Offerings and Token Sales, cryptoassets have had large impacts in start-up financing, competing with Venture Capital. Beyond cryptoassets, the range of use cases expanded dramatically through smart contracts, and blockchain technologies are currently used in managing identity, personal data, elections, supply chains, energy grids, property registries, and Internet of Things. Blockchain's novelty and design pose regulatory challenges about data protection, illicit uses, geographic delimitation of competent jurisdictions, and how to enforce judicial decision on ostensibly immutable ledgers. Blockchain technologies offer a fertile ground to explore issues of trust, power, identity, ownership, and value. Geographic research can unpack blockchain's potentialities and ambiguities for disintermediation and reintermediation, decentralization and control, co-production and capitalization.

A public and auditable record of the environmental impact of each supply chain stage can be made using blockchain technology. A more streamlined and effective supply chain is made possible by blockchain's decentralized structure. Delays, mistakes, and the need for middlemen are decreased by real-time access to a shared ledger. IIoT devices like sensors and RFID tags can provide real-time data on the location, condition, and environmental parameters of goods. Blockchain can then be used to record and incentivize sustainable practices, such as reducing energy consumption or minimizing waste. The integration of blockchain with IIoT can develop the supply chain management for enabling real-time tracking of goods, optimizing inventory management, and ensuring compliance with sustainability standards. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the key challenges facing traditional supply chains and how the combined use of Blockchains and IIoT technologies. The review also evaluates the environmental, social, and economic implications of adopting Blockchain-enabled IIoT solutions in supply chain operations. Furthermore, the review assesses the current state of research and development, identifying gaps in existing literature and proposing avenues for future exploration. As a results, by highlighting the synergies between these technologies, it seeks to inspire further innovation and adoption, ultimately fostering a more resilient, transparent, and environmentally conscious industrial ecosystem.}

abstract = {In this paper, organic-inorganic coordination polymers of the CdBr2(H2N-(CH2)n-NH2) general formula, where n = 4 – 10 and 12, were studied. All the materials were synthesized as very fine powders from metal salt and diamine solutions following an analogous simple procedure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and recorded powder X-ray diffraction patterns (PXRD) allowed for the assessment of the purity and crystallinity of the products. Based on the collected diffraction data, lattice parameters and symmetry were determined. For five of the synthesized compounds (n = 4, 6, 7, 8, and 12) that were of relatively high purity and sufficient crystallinity, crystal structure models were determined and refined. It was found that the structure symmetry depends on the parity of the number of carbon atoms in the diamine molecules. Structures of the investigated compounds belonging to the even series are centrosymmetric while the ones from the odd series are not (P21 space group). Structures’ symmetry of compounds based on even diamines decreases from P2/m to P1¯ with increasing length of the organic molecules. Diamine molecules are aligned parallel to the diagonals of the (010) faces of the unit cell and there is an almost perfectly linear correlation between the value of a lattice parameter and the number of C atoms. There are, however, separate trends for even or odd series. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and non-ambient PXRD measurements provided information about the thermal decomposition of the materials. The temperature of decomposition decreases with the growing length of diamine molecules and achieves the lowest value (176 °C, 449 K) for the compound with 1,12-diaminododecane (the longest diamine among the studied ones) while the sample with 1,4-diaminobutane is the most stable one (up to around 284 °C, 557 K). The studied compounds also show odd-even separate trends concerning the decomposition temperature. The compounds with even diamines start to decompose at relatively higher temperatures than the ones belonging to the odd series.}

Riding on the magnanimous promises of the blockchain secure validation mechanism and decentralized mass collaboration, cryptocurrencies are the newest asset class being introduced to investors worldwide and are being used by companies to raise capital to further their development of the advancement of blockchain technology via ICOs. The substantial inflow of unregulated capital into a transactional and transnational industry has aroused interest from not just investors but also national securities and monetary regulatory agencies. In this chapter, we explore the potential for blockchain to exacerbate the already decentralized economy. We review the Securities and Exchange Commission’s initial statements on ICOs to illustrate the potential problems with applying a dated legal framework to an ever-evolving ecosystem. Recognizing the inability of enforcement within existing regulatory frameworks, we argue for the regulation of the crypto asset class and internal collaboration between government agencies and developers in the establishment of an ecosystem that integrates investor protection and investment.}

Our results showed that economic governance is based on metaverse tokens that cannot be defined as reliable virtual currencies due to their explosive behaviour, negative performance, and higher volatility compared to traditional alternatives. Paradoxically, fiat currencies and stablecoins could be more appropriate candidates for the payment infrastructure. Moreover, we also observed that NFT prices are affected by the cryptocurrency market, which highlights the risk of metaverse commerce.

abstract = {Summary
Background
A comprehensive understanding of temporal trends in the disease burden in Australia is lacking, and these trends are required to inform health service planning and improve population health. We explored the burden and trends of diseases and their risk factors in Australia from 1990 to 2019 through a comprehensive analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019.
Methods
In this systematic analysis for GBD 2019, we estimated all-cause mortality using the standardised GBD methodology. Data sources included primarily vital registration systems with additional data from sample registrations, censuses, surveys, surveillance, registries, and verbal autopsies. A composite measure of health loss caused by fatal and non-fatal disease burden (disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs]) was calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs). Comparisons between Australia and 14 other high-income countries were made.
Findings
Life expectancy at birth in Australia improved from 77·0 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 76·9–77·1) in 1990 to 82·9 years (82·7–83·1) in 2019. Between 1990 and 2019, the age-standardised death rate decreased from 637·7 deaths (95% UI 634·1–641·3) to 389·2 deaths (381·4–397·6) per 100 000 population. In 2019, non-communicable diseases remained the major cause of mortality in Australia, accounting for 90·9% (95% UI 90·4–91·9) of total deaths, followed by injuries (5·7%, 5·3–6·1) and communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (3·3%, 2·9–3·7). Ischaemic heart disease, self-harm, tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer, stroke, and colorectal cancer were the leading causes of YLLs. The leading causes of YLDs were low back pain, depressive disorders, other musculoskeletal diseases, falls, and anxiety disorders. The leading risk factors for DALYs were high BMI, smoking, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, and drug use. Between 1990 and 2019, all-cause DALYs decreased by 24·6% (95% UI 21·5–28·1). Relative to similar countries, Australia's ranking improved for age-standardised death rates and life expectancy at birth but not for YLDs and YLLs between 1990 and 2019.
Interpretation
An important challenge for Australia is to address the health needs of people with non-communicable diseases. The health systems must be prepared to address the increasing demands of non-communicable diseases and ageing.

The paper outlines two core problems, which were inspired by recent legislative activities in Belarus and Russia. The first is a possible displacement of existing legal regimes of objects of civil rights by the legal regime of the token. Secondly, the problem of definition of the nature of rights to tokens arises (in rem versus ad personam) as well as remedies for their violations. Provisions of the Belarus Decree “On the development of digital economy” of 21 December 2017 and drafts of the laws on blockchain and ICO, discussed in Russian Parliament and Government are taken to illustrate these problems.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology has gained considerable attention for different types of stakeholders due to its stable implementation in the field of digital currency like Bitcoin. Some users use Bitcoin for payment exchanges against any business while others use the Bitcoin network for earning Bitcoins itself, and there is also another type of user who called hackers those flood different types of attacks to illegally earn some Bitcoins or collapsing overall network. There are also numerous uses of blockchain technology, e.g. health, automation industry, energy sector, security and authentication in smart grids. In this study, we have elaborated on different critical aspects of Blockchain technology like its style of working mechanism, possible improvement suggestions by using Proof-of-Stake, and other custom variations, attempting seven types of challenges by different novel techniques. Moreover, we have also explained the current state-of-the-artwork in blockchain’s non-financial applications like Healthcare in which contribution of four-layered custom blockchain models related to precision medicine and the clinical trial was notable. Moreover, a mobile app model called HDG for the automation of medical records without compromising privacy was also a prominent contribution.}

Motivated by the challenges presented during pandemics such as COVID-19, this article aims to enhance healthcare transparency and expedite treatment processes. The existing centralized medical data management system scatters patient records across disparate hospitals and pharmacies, prompting the necessity for a patient-centric data repository. The integration of blockchain emerges as a viable solution, giving patients control over their information and facilitating seamless sharing with relevant institutions—be it hospitals, pharmacies, or insurance firms. This article outlines a strategic framework for securing medical data based on comprehensive literature review and proposes measures derived from previous studies. Furthermore, the study explores blockchain's application in tracing medicinal supplies, crucial for detecting counterfeit medications within the supply chain. Detailed elucidation of IBM Research's proposed model highlights the potential of blockchain in this domain. Additionally, an extensive comparative analysis of existing models underscores their strengths and limitations in these healthcare applications. Challenges persist in deploying blockchain in developing countries, primarily due to resource limitations, signalling the need for tailored solutions conducive to such environments. This study serves as an exploration, emphasising the need for continued research and innovation in harnessing blockchain's potential for healthcare transformation.}

We study intraorganizational blockchains from an agency perspective to understand how the distributed, sequenced, and consensus-based nature of blockchains mitigates information asymmetries and affects organizational structures. First, we explain how blockchains differ from conventional relational, contractual, and system-based mechanisms to address three pertinent information challenges—concentration, continuity, and conflict. Subsequently, we address the consequences of introducing such blockchains, arguing that they create both direct and sequenced information channels among principals and agents, which elicit an organizational reconfiguration via vertical disintermediation and lateral reintermediation. Finally, we theorize the implications of blockchain-based organizing for agency theory regarding the chain of command, the unity of direction, and the span of control. Overall, we show how blockchains for intraorganizational governance can mitigate principal-agent problems and impact organizational design in profound ways.}

Among the most well-known BOSMs, the introduction of blockchain is geared towards providing a decentralised social platform, together with an auditable and transparent rewarding system. While some current BOSMs have gathered a large set of dedicated users, they can hardly fight against the hegemony of the most well known centralised platforms, such as Twitter or Facebook. Yup tries to overcome this issue by proposing a rewarding system that can integrate with existing platforms. Its rewarding system keeps track of any piece of content uniquely identified by an URL, so its usage is not restricted to OSNs only. Given its unique approach, its rewarding system represents an important case study that, to the best of our knowledge, is not covered in the literature. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting the rewarding system provided by Yup and understanding its implications on the social activity of the users. Our analyses uncover that the voting activity favours the creation of echo chambers, and that the rewarding system is unfair. Additionally, we identify some limitations that can help design new rewarding systems.}

Using a simple model, we show that the number of miners could be negatively (positively) related to the expected rewards if miners with low-operating costs also have less (more) severe financing constraints. We characterize the possibility of miners with low-operating (high-operating) costs facing less (more) severe financing constraints as large-size (small-size) miners. The empirical evidence supports the model's large- and small-size miner characterization prediction. The negative association between the number of miners and expected rewards is attributable to Bitcoin's exchange rate. Collectively, our evidence suggests that even though the Bitcoin system is designed as an egalitarian system, it is likely to evolve into a near-centralized system because of economic forces.}

abstract = {In the context of the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and the extensive proliferation of the global Internet, the authenticity of data has become a focal point of societal demand. It plays a decisive role in enhancing the quality of decision-making and operational efficiency. However, the storage and authenticity verification of large-scale IoT real-time data present unprecedented technical challenges. Faced with the inherent data security risks of traditional centralized cloud storage, blockchain technology reveals its unique potential for solutions with its inherent immutability and decentralization. Nevertheless, current blockchain-based data storage solutions are still restricted by high costs and inefficiency. To address these challenges, this paper innovatively proposes the BI-TSFID framework, which leverages the benefits of Ethereum and IPFS and optimizes the Merkle Tree structure and verification mechanisms. The BI-TSFID framework adopts a strategy of on-chain data summary storage and off-chain computation. This approach provides IoT with efficient and reliable data storage, reduces operational costs, and simplifies the verification process. This research has improved the data computation efficiency by refining the structure of the Merkle Tree and analyzed its optimal branch number. Additionally, the study introduces a sampling-based data integrity verification method that significantly reduces resource consumption during the verification process. Experimental results show that the solutions proposed in this paper effectively enhance the efficiency and security of IoT data management and provide valuable guidance for the theory and practice of real-time data storage and verification, further promoting the development and innovation in the related technological fields.}

Blockchain Technologies promised to bring about decentralized trust having the potential to disrupt digital ecosystems by providing alternatives to centralized storage and management of data.

However, Blockchain Technology is designed to provide other Value Propositions beyond decentralized storage, such as innovative crypto economic and investment models and radical new forms of decentralized participative governance models that could lead to the evolution of new generation of Digital Platforms and multi stakeholder business interactions. In this paper, through a systematic literature review, we present a set of key Blockchain Value Propositions and a discussion on how it can complement to the evolution of Digital Platforms and the Collaborative Economy. We also argue that while some of the value propositions are easier to integrate with existing Digital Platforms, more disruptive value propositions such as Business Automation, Economic and Governance Models present greater challenges but could lead to not just innovation at the technological level, but also metamorphosis of the existing social, economic and governance models.}

abstract = {Diamine oxidase (DAO) is one of the key enzymes involved in the degradation of dietary histamine. An imbalance of histamine scavenging systems leads to histamine intolerance, a diet-related disorder that may be tackled by following a low-histamine diet. Recently, the supplementation with exogenous DAO enzyme of animal origin has received the green light as a novel food to enhance intestinal degradation of histamine. This work performed a screening for histamine-degrading capacity of Leguminosae species in order to explore its potential suitability as plant-derived active ingredient of enzymatic supplements. In vitro DAO activity was determined both in raw pulses and lyophilised sprouts by an enzymatic assay coupled to UHPLC-FLD and several germination and storage conditions were assessed. The sprouts of edible legumes showed an in vitro histamine-degrading capacity ranging from 36.0 to 408.3 mU g−1, much higher than that found for the non-germinated seeds (0.14–1.95 mU g−1). The germination of legume seeds for 6 days in darkness provided the maximum DAO activity. Only the freezing storage of the lyophilised sprouts kept the enzymatic activity intact for at least 12 months. These results demonstrate that certain edible legumes could be suitable for the formulation of DAO supplements for the treatment of histamine intolerance.}

More specifically, the microcarbon residue (MCR) content, the colloidal instability index (CII), the stability index (SI), and the Heithaus parameter (P value) were employed. The catalytic hydrocracking of heavy oils was carried out in a slurry-phase semi-batch reactor at 410 °C under 110 bar of hydrogen and in the presence of a Mo-octoate precursor (1000 wppm). The correlation between the feedstock properties (i.e., the MCR content and the CII) and the reaction performance in the upgrading process was established. It was found that feedstocks with higher MCR contents also contained greater numbers of aromatic components and shorter alkyl side chains, resulting in a higher tendency for coke formation and a lower yield of de-asphalted oil (DAO). Stability evaluation showed that stable feedstocks tended to produce less coke, greater DAO yields, and lower amounts of impurities compared to unstable feedstocks. In addition, it was revealed that the CII was sensitive to the reaction performance, suggesting that improving the stabilities of asphaltenes by means of the solvency effect is the key to obtaining high product quality.}

Because of the rapid growth in their popularity, ICOs have become a prominent research topic. However, the lack of knowledge about the nature of this kind of financial operation inevitably raises several important unanswered questions. This study starts by providing a comprehensive description of the characteristics, benefits, and risks associated with ICOs. Then, using a panel data set comprising daily information for 125 ICOs (44,217 observations gathered from December 2017 to December 2018), this study explores the influence of the ICO presale period, ICO category, Bitcoin spot returns, Bitcoin futures returns, and sentiment extracted from social media on ICO returns. The results suggest that while Bitcoin spot and Bitcoin futures returns exert a positive influence on ICO returns, the existence of a presale period exerts a negative influence, and ICO category seems to be non-significant. Sentiment extracted from social networks positively influences ICO returns. Further conclusions of this study are presented in the last section.}

abstract = {Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a ‘block’, the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.}

Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.}

At the same time, scientists and developers are searching for innovative methods to better understand how the fundamental shifts caused by digital change will affect the future of humanity over the coming decades. Interdisciplinary governance research at the intersection of technological and environmental foresight is urgently needed to minimize the risks of technological change and explore how digitalization may support, hinder or re-shape sustainability transformations. In this article, we focus on the case of ‘blockchain’ or distributed-ledger technology (DLT) to investigate how recent digital technologies may support the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. Our investigation is centered on areas of public administration and governance which will most likely see an adoption of DLT over the next two decades, such as digital identity, social service provision, and innovative climate finance. To allow for a meaningful comparison of various use cases, we propose four guiding questions that can help researchers, decision-makers and practitioners to determine whether DLT might be an appropriate choice for the sustainability-related task at hand. Moreover, we illustrate how the initial design and subsequent implementation of DLTs may support more centralized or networked modes of governance.}

Due to the innovative characteristics of decentralization, transparency, immutability, and anonymity, blockchain applications break new ground for users' decision-making in an operations environment. There is a lack of evidence regarding herding in blockchain technology in general and its potential effect on blockchain application platforms in particular. In response to this new technological phenomenon, we studied whether and how herding behaviors take place in the context of blockchain applications for operations in this research. We propose two new variables related to the operation of the blockchain application (i.e., technical assurance and decentralized management efforts) and a new variable related to user identity (i.e., identifiability). We found evidence of the existence of herding by utilizing the objective data of approximately 0.1 million transactions on a leading blockchain application platform providing self-service and collateral-based lending services. Our empirical findings also reveal that technical assurance and decentralized management efforts reduce users' herding tendencies. Moreover, we found that the higher the identifiability, the lower the users' herding tendency, and the less they are affected by technical assurance and decentralized management efforts.}

Despite this enthusiasm, empirical research examining the practical feasibility and critical assessment of blockchain's potential within the circular economy remains limited. This study engages with eleven distinguished blockchain experts to critically analyze the prospects of technology integration across various facets of the circular economy, aiming to predict potential outcomes. Utilizing the Delphi method, this research seeks to attain a consensus on the experts' visions and opinions. The findings suggest a nuanced perspective: while certain integrations in the circular economy may face challenges and are unlikely to succeed, others could prove effective in the long term, provided specific conditions are met. When appropriately designed Tokenomics are in place, and the necessary level of digitalization is achieved, blockchain technology can significantly incentivize circular economy practices. However, the complete disintermediation of circular practices through blockchain is viewed as less feasible, owing to its reliance on external data providers.}

According to the findings, there is a significant positive correlation between price volatility values of Bitcoin and Litecoin. Besides, the volatility values of Ethereum have a positive correlation with both Ripple and Stellar. There is also a positive correlation between the volatility values of Ripple and Dash. These findings are robust to consider different correlation networks. The evidence implies that Bitcoin is mainly related to Litecoin, but Ethereum is associated with other cryptocurrencies.}

abstract = {As emphasized by the challenging sustainable development agenda, countries are facing a complicated combination of environmental stress and social challenges, leading the Earth system towards an unsustainable path. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately assess past fluctuations contributing to current situations and apprehend plausible future implications. This study integrates safe and just operating space (SJOS) with Sustainable Development Goals to depict multiple “windows” of environmental and social evolution in different historical periods, with 31 provinces in China as a case study. Then, we track the spatiotemporal evolution trajectory of environmental performance and social well-being in each province from 2012 to 2021. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is utilized to capture the temporal relationships between various indicators and to forecast the spatial trends of SJOS in the provinces from 2022 to 2030. Research findings indicate that: (1) over the 2012–2021 period, the environmental performance of the majority of provinces far exceeds the warning thresholds, with no province falling within all threshold boundaries simultaneously. The phosphorus cycle is the most challenging boundary, with only 6.8% of provinces within the safe boundary over the past 10 years. In comparison, freshwater use performs the best, with 80% of provinces staying within the threshold. (2) Social well-being generally improves across all provinces from 2012 to 2021, but the spatial and temporal trajectories are more varied. All provinces meet the thresholds for the food security and employment indicators. However, none of the provinces meet the standard for the social equity indicator. (3) Over the 2022–2030 projection period, environmental performance and social well-being trend in opposite directions across provinces. This culminates in no province being entirely within the safe and just space by 2030. Sanitation shows the most significant change compared to other indicators. Xinjiang had the largest improvement at 59.12%, while Tianjin had the most significant downward trend at 53.88%. Adjustments in national policies and priorities are essential if China wants to accomplish the sufficiency of biophysical resources whilst ensuring social equity in the access and exploitation of these resources.}

The IoT, or “Internet of Things,” is a system of interconnected electronic devices that can communicate with one another and be remotely monitored and handled. This paper reviews the most recent findings in the field of blockchain and Internet of Things with the goal of examining blockchain as a possible answer to secure IoT data management within supply networks. There is a dearth of literature in the early stages of both blockchain and IoT study because they are such novel topics. The study's findings suggest that in order to improve their leadership quality to intentionally impact employee performance, industry managers should pay attention to human resource management indicators like collaboration, involvement, actualization, perception, and teamwork. This is primarily because of the inherent limitations of IoT devices and the distributed ledger architecture of the blockchain technology. There is potential for IoT to provide many advantages if blockchain capabilities can be optimized for it.}
