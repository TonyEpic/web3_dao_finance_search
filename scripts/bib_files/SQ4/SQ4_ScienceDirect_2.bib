abstract = {Blockchain technology has been receiving much public attention recently, promising to disintermediate transactions through decentralized governance and distributed data-infrastructures. However, the majority of the previous studies have focused on the technical aspects, and overlooked blockchain investigation from a managerial perspective. In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions—transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement—, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.}

Debate on decentralization and good governance is twofold: administrative and political. Conditioned by international aid, decentralization discourses in Jordan emphasize an administrative reform to achieve economic development and social justice. In urban heritage governance, confining decentralization discourses to economic dimensions undermines the impact of the ‘political culture’ of governance. The study analyzes the political culture of decentralization as it evolved in Jordan in two phases: archeological governance and urban heritage governance. Based on both primary and secondary data, the study traces the totalitarian lineage that has marked the former centralized political culture of archeological governance during colonialism. Political cultural lineage is challenging the flux of democratic and decentralization discourses in contemporary urban heritage governance; leading alternatively to democracy crisis that features the re-introduction of colonialism in the form of ‘internal colonialism’. The study recommends a political cultural reform that liberates decentralized urban governance among its multi-layered governmental system from the traditional ethos of external and internal colonialism.}

One possible solution was to develop and implement a case progression decision support system (DSS) for decision making support. This paper describes a field experiment undertaken to determine the effectiveness of using a decentralized DSS compared with a centralized one, as well as comparing the decentralized DSS with no formalized decision support system. The field experiment evaluated the investigators' attitudes toward the availability of information, accuracy of information, support in problem identification, perceived usefulness of the system, and its overall effectiveness. Results indicated that there is a significant difference between the participants' attitudes toward availability of information and support in identifying problems. Furthermore, the study showed that either the centralized or the decentralized DSS is considerably more effective than the current approach of not using a DSS at all.}

We explored the links between software as a service (SaaS) and organizational agility by conducting two stages of interviews with key informants in large organizations, and by employing affordance and inertia-theoretical lenses. Two basic affordances emerged from the retroductive data analysis – implementing quickly and sourcing independently – which in turn yielded two higher-level affordances: trialing alternatives and self-organizing business teams. We developed a model that explains how and why these four affordances enhance agility by accelerating the sensing-to-acting process of organizations. We also describe how five categories of organizational inertia in IT units hinder agility. Our main contribution is how adopting SaaS applications enables organizational agility while highlighting the role of IT unit inertia in SaaS affordance actualization processes.}

The estimation results indicate that higher income inequality has a significant negative impact on public health performance. Interestingly, fiscal decentralization has negative direct and indirect effects on public health. Therefore, the empirical results suggest that China’s provincial governments, which have gained significant fiscal power through increased fiscal decentralization, should take the problem of income inequality more seriously, because fiscal decentralization and income equality may both have the potential to benefit public health.}

The paper argues that governments in regions that rely heavily on intergovernmental transfers and natural resource rents face serious distortions in their incentive structure. As a result, such regions tend to have more fiscally centralized governments than the regional characteristics would suggest. Data on Russian regions in the late 1990s—early 2000s support this hypothesis. Advancing intraregional fiscal decentralization in rentier regions could reduce policy distortions, and make the subnational environment more supportive of economic development.}

Claims of autochthony, or claims to have settled a given place first, have become increasingly common in Africa, but they clash with efforts to introduce notions of national citizenship under the democratization and decentralization reforms that have been adopted across the continent in the last three decades. This paper analyses this tension through the empirical case of autochthony claims that emerged in the context of the creation of a “municipal forest” under the forest decentralization reform in Burkina Faso, which draws on community-based governance. It argues that in this case, autochthony is a claim for the rights to have rights, for citizenship, that takes shape within a wider politics of framing what “the community” is, and what it is good for on the ground. It draws on the work of Tania Li’s work on indigeneity to illuminate the role of some of the contradictions underlying this framing – namely the lack of actual devolution and the reification of “the customary” – that help understand why autochthony becomes a powerful positioning to claim the right to have rights. So, while autochthony first appears as a breakdown of (national) community, because it clashes with the juridico-legal ideal of citizenship, if we look at the politics of decentralizing forest management in practice, it rather seems to be an integral part of claiming the rights to have rights within a globalised “community-based” form of rule.}

Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field.

abstract = {Weak institutions have been identified as a principal cause of the poor developmental outcomes of many resource-rich states. Research has largely focused on national-level institutions and governance, whereas their subnational equivalents remain understudied. Subnational governments, partially empowered by decentralization reforms, have increasingly sought to use existing institutions to influence mineral resource governance although they have no formal authority over such resources. This article examines the implementation of land-use zoning and planning in three Peruvian regions (2007–2016). It focuses on how and when subnational governments seek to influence mineral governance and under what conditions they succeed in strengthening institutions for inclusive and sustainable development. Theoretically, the article draws on the literature on decentralized forest governance and empirically it is based on extensive ethnographic research carried out in the three regions, written primary sources and 139 semi-structured interviews. Our analysis suggests that, whereas regional governments have strong incentives to use land-use zoning to influence mineral governance, they often lack capacity, accountable representation, and support from the central government. Still, land-use zoning has provided regional governments with information about natural resources that has been used in negotiations with mining companies, but also to improve regional planning. To have durable impacts on development, profound state reform to achieve sectoral integration and political decentralization is, however, needed. Our findings add to debates about extractive governance by showing how subnational governments, without having formal authority over mineral resources, still play an important role in shaping the developmental outcomes of resource extraction. Our paper also provokes important questions regarding how subnational governments could be included in extractive governance and which mechanisms for reconciling different interests are likely to be most effective. All told, a better understanding of how inclusive subnational institutions are effectively enforced and gain stability is crucial for transforming resource wealth into sustainable development.}

However, these new architectures have motivated researchers to investigate new privacy solutions that allow DOSN’s users to protect their contents by taking into account the decentralized nature of the DOSNs platform. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the privacy solutions adopted by currently available DOSNs, and we compare them by exploiting several criteria. After presenting the differences that existing DOSNs present in terms of provided services and architecture, we identify, for each of them, the privacy model used to define the privacy policies and the mechanisms for their management (i.e., initialization and modification of the privacy policy). In addition, we evaluate the overhead introduced by the security mechanisms adopted for privacy policy management and enforcement by discussing their advantages and drawbacks.}

Analyzing design principles and supply chain sustainability are critical for organizational success in today's competitive marketplace. The process of evaluating an organization's supply chain design principles and manufacturing sustainability entails incorporating various sources of information, which are typically uncertain, incomplete, and subjective in nature. Particularly when various organizations are confronted with significant principles such as a lack of interoperability, decentralization, virtualization, real-time and capabilities, service orientation, and so on. Using graph theory and a matrix approach (GTMA), this article attempts to analyze the interaction between design principles-related factors with a focus on operational excellence, growth and sustainability in supply chains by considering the business of Industry 4.0. We have considered electrical equipment manufacturing Industry 4.0 as test ground. Based on a literature review and expert opinions, we identified several key principles, and then explored the most significant one using graph theory and a matrix approach. The findings indicate that autonomy has been evaluated as the most significant challenge to manage design principles most effectively for sustainable manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 context. Therefore, organizations must enhance autonomous systems capable of operating and making decisions alone, without relying on external instructions or support, in order to achieve sustainability. This and the other identified principles to achieving corporate supply chain sustainability are ranked in this paper. These findings will be useful for managers and policymakers managing the interaction between people and processes, as well as corporate sustainability management in Industry 4.0-based supply chain organizations. The unique contributions of this paper can aid in the improvement of design principles and the sustainability of emerging economies' Industry 4.0 perspectives.}

Pakistan, home of the world’s most extensive irrigation system, has followed a global trend in irrigation to devolve management from government to farmers and farmer organizations. We implement the most extensive survey of irrigation management ever conducted in Pakistan to examine variation in farmer participation in managing local irrigation systems under the new governance regime. Building on and adding to previous work in Pakistan and elsewhere, we examine the effects of privately accessed groundwater, groundwater quality, surface water, and other factors along 5 different community management responsibilities, including roles that existed prior to decentralization (maintenance of the watercourse and dispute resolution) and new roles that were created after (voting to elect representative at the higher level, collection of water charges, and holding internal meetings). Each responsibility represents a collection action problem for the community. We find that while group leader education is important in successful execution of the roles, voting has in general been taken up enthusiastically while water charge collection remains, not surprisingly, low. We find a previously unreported inverse-U shaped relationship between groundwater availability and farmer participation, and that availability of high groundwater quality (less-saline) groundwater significantly reduces participation, as does high variation in canal water supply within a growing season. We also find, contrary to expectation, that communities in the tail reaches of the system, known to receive worse canal water service, more actively participate in managing their local irrigation systems. The findings have important implications for the continued push for decentralized surface irrigation management in South Asia and elsewhere as groundwater irrigation continues to expand and equitable access to surface water remains a policy concern.}

However, a prevalent issue is the ad hoc adoption of SIPs without a cohesive strategy, resulting in isolated solutions that do not effectively enhance core organisational functions. Our research fills this critical gap by identifying and combining the capabilities and barriers posed by SIPs. Our findings allow us to propose a framework comprising the stages each main organisational function needs to develop to move from a traditional to a completely autonomous decision-making function. This evolutional path requires that each organisational function acquires selected capabilities and overcomes specific barriers. Our approach encompasses a multi-method methodology, commencing with a systematic literature review (SLR) encompassing 44 papers, leading to the identification of 20 capabilities and 23 barriers. Subsequently, through rigorous content analyses and expert interviews, we formulate the framework. This paper contributes to academia by providing a framework with an evolutional path that main organisational functions may follow according to the capability they acquire from the SIP and which barriers should be surpassed at each level. For managers in practice, the proposed framework enables a better understanding of the stage of their operations and which capabilities will take their main organisational function from traditional (level 0) to autonomous (level 3) stages.}

A twofold object-oriented approach is undertaken for the redesign of production planning and control. To increase the flexibility and adaptability of such systems, this paper first outlines a concept of decentralized production planning and control. This is based on a distribution of production and operations management tasks to interacting autonomous organizational units, structuring manufacturing in an object-oriented manner. The essential feature of each unit is the integration of planning, realization and control tasks, planning being based on time frames. Second, it is shown how the concept can be realized by means of an object-oriented information systems development. A generic information system is designed for the general properties of an organizational unit. Taking advantage of object-oriented technology (e.g. inheritance, reuseability), it serves as a reference and building block for the design of local information systems each supporting an individual organizational unit. The generic information system is customized to the required features of a specific organizational unit according to the level of planning and the organizational structure of the domain. The overall system is set up by a network of such customized local information systems.}

The research was carried out by reviewing published and grey literature, as well as national and regional legislation; in addition, 19 experts from hospitals and the industry were interviewed. In both countries, there has been a shift in political power from the national to the regional level. At the same time, the content of public coverage has become more explicit. A major issue in both systems is reimbursement, i.e. the rules about funding the delivery of services included in the benefit baskets. The differences in procurement and funding mechanisms create different incentives that may have an impact on the uptake and diffusion of technologies. These mechanisms, however, can only partially explain organizational and professional behaviour, as the use of technologies in both countries is mainly left to professionals who are exposed to a variety of incentives. There is limited direct and indirect guidance of national and regional authorities over the use of technologies in both countries. It is likely that the difficult search for a balance between introducing innovations, containing costs and assuring equity will require stronger regulatory action in the next future.}

abstract = {Globally, centralised urban water systems are under pressure to respond to environmental and economic pressures. In Australia, high infrastructure costs and variable rainfall have prompted governments, end-users and property developers to begin investing in more decentralised systems that use alternative water sources (rainwater, stormwater and wastewater). This trend is based on a fit-for-purpose principle and is part of a global shift toward sustainable urban water management. These developments suggest that Australia's urban water sector may be in the early stages of transition and represent a multi-decadal shift from centralisation of water supply and sanitation to partial decentralisation based on local conditions. Much of the scholarship on decentralised systems focuses on drivers and barriers to adoption, which implies a static and mechanistic process of change, and overlooks the complex interplay between exogenous pressures, innovation, multiple actors and industry reform. This paper addresses this gap by analysing temporal processes of Australia's urban water sector, using a regionally based case study comprising an historical review and interview study that analyses the multi-level, -decadal and -actor developments at the nexus between water service provision and property development. The analysis revealed emerging tensions between incumbent water utilities, property developers and end-users, and an inherent conflict between neo-liberal and environmental policy agendas. Such tensions and conflicts are missing from urban water policy and research discourse.}

To cope with such threads and vulnerabilities, urban sustainability and resilience oriented plans have been developed. Accordingly, policy makers need to learn how to properly integrate urban sustainability with urban resilience principles and practices in the re-shaping of urban agendas. In order to highlight the future potential of integrating transformative resilience principles into the general sustainability approach, this paper provides a critical review of a recent and successful urban regeneration and development plan, the “Mexico City Green Plan”. This paper also discusses a feasibility study for urban redevelopment and transition towards resilience in Mexico City, in order to illustrate the necessity and potential of urban resilience for the improvement of the life prospects of disadvantaged inhabitant groups. The Valle del Chalco neighborhood in Mexico City is presented as an example, whereby resilient and sustainable urban transformation was achieved through an integrated and sustainable decentralized water management and infrastructure plan. In practice, the terms ‘Sustainability’ and ‘Resilience’ can be exploited to justify conventional, non-sustainable urban development practices. The results discussed in this paper demonstrate the necessity of the integration of transformative resilience principles within sustainable urban redevelopment and regeneration. The main findings are i) Policy makers underestimate the potential of urban resilience in shaping more sustainable urban futures, since they only understand resilience as the flipside of specific vulnerabilities, ii) The building of urban resilience within sustainable urban transitions and redevelopment can effectively foster people empowerment, particularly in combination with the decentralization of resources management systems, and iii) The main challenge for the implementation and execution of transitions processes towards urban resilience and sustainability is the elimination of political barriers.}

In this paper, we build a self-organized decentralized OSN (SDOSN) on the overlay network of an IoT infrastructure resembling real life social graph. A user model based on homophily features is proposed considering social relationships and user interests and focuses on the key OSN functionality of efficient information dissemination.

We expect the technologies that comprise IoT to become smarter; to autonomously reason, act, and communicate with other entities in the environment; and to achieve shared goals. To realize the full potential of these systems, we must understand the mechanisms that allow multiple intelligent entities to effectively operate, collaborate, and learn in changing and uncertain environments. The future IoT devices must not only maintain enough intelligence to perceive and act locally, but also possess team-level collaboration and adaptation processes. We posit that such processes embody energy-minimizing mechanisms found in all biological and physical systems, and operate over the objectives and constraints that can be defined and analyzed locally by individual devices without the need for global centralized control. In this chapter, we represent multiple IoT devices as a team of intelligent agents, and postulate that multiagent systems achieve adaptive behaviors by minimizing a team’s free energy, which decomposes into distributed iterative perception (inference) and control (action) processes. First, we discuss instantiation of this mechanism for a joint distributed decision-making problem. Next, we present experimental evidence that energy-based teams outperform utility-based teams. Finally, we discuss different learning processes that support team-level adaptation.}

Future electrical distribution systems, or even transmission structures that combine AC and DC sources and loads are thought to be most promising when it comes to hybrid AC-DC systems. Using a combined operation of both AC and DC microgrids through an interfacing converter, hybrid AC-DC microgrids are advanced and benefitted with the use of both AC and DC topologies. Power management techniques for these microgrids are among the most important operational aspects. This paper provides a systematic review on numerous schemes to control hybrid AC-DC microgrids. Basically, microgrid control strategies are categorized as local control and coordinated control. Coordinated control is further divided in three control strategies as, distributed, centralized, and decentralized control. All these control strategies are employed to satisfy many control objectives, like bus voltage and frequency regulation, power sharing, and management, power quality, stability and reliability improvement, energy management, and economic dispatch. In this paper, various aspects associated with these control objectives and limitations in their control strategies are discussed. Also, future prospects on control of hybrid AC-DC microgrids and an effective and robust control strategy for power management possibly to be employed, are presented in the concluding section of this paper.}

Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading. Moreover, the authentic gas consumption and computational time to the smart contract indicate that this platform is able to achieve an efficient and effective transaction with multi-player participation.}

In this paper, we propose a Blockchain leveraged decentralized eHealth architecture which comprises three layers: (1) The Sensing layer – Body Area Sensor Networks include medical sensors typically on or in a patient body transmitting data to a smartphone. (2) The NEAR processing layer – Edge Networks consist of devices at one hop from data sensing IoT devices. (3) The FAR processing layer – Core Networks comprise Cloud or other high computing servers). A Patient Agent (PA) software replicated on the three layers processes medical data to ensure reliable, secure and private communication. The PA executes a lightweight Blockchain consensus mechanism and utilizes a Blockchain leveraged task-offloading algorithm to ensure patient’s privacy while outsourcing tasks. Performance analysis of the decentralized eHealth architecture has been conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the system in the processing and storage of RPM data.}

Over the past three decades, decentralization and reforms designed to insulate service providers from interference by elected officials (“insulating reforms”), such as corporatization and privatization, swept through the urban water and sanitation sector in developing countries. We argue that their rationales were contradictory; decentralization was intended to increase citizen participation and influence, whereas corporatization and privatization were intended to depoliticize management. We document the widespread promotion and adoption of these reforms, and conclude that decentralization made it difficult to insulate service provision in practice. We argue that studying how institutional reforms interact with one another can help explain reform consequences.}

abstract = {Decentralized drinking-water systems are an important element in the process of reaching the Millennium Development Goals, as centralized systems are often deficient or non-existent in developing and transition countries (DC and TC). Most water-quality problems are due to hygiene factors and pathogens. A range of decentralized systems is available to counter these problems, including thermal and/or UV methods, physical removal and chemical treatment. This review focuses on decentralized systems that treat the potable water (drinking and cooking) of a single household (point-of-use systems) or a community (small-scale systems). For application in DC and TC, important boundary conditions for decentralized systems include low costs, ease of use, sustainability, low maintenance and independence of utilities (energy sources). Although some low-cost systems are available, their application is limited by time-consuming daily operation and maintenance. Other systems are too expensive for the poor populations of DC and TC and in most cases do not fulfill the system requirements described above. Point-of-use systems based on membranes are commercially available and are designed to operate on tap pressure or gravity. Membrane systems are attractive since they provide an absolute barrier for pathogens and remove turbidity, thus increasing the palatability of the water. The costs of membrane have decreased rapidly during the last decades and therefore membrane systems have also become within reach for application in low-cost applications in DC and TC. Some membrane systems rely on gravity as a driving force, thereby avoiding the use of pumps and electricity. On the basis of the present literature data, no small-scale systems could be identified which meet all the requirements for successful implementation. Furthermore, in the available literature the performance of highly fouling water types has not been reported. For such cases, more extensive studies are required and a need for suitable pre-treatment was identified. It can be concluded that there are good prospects for decentralized systems based on membranes, but that a need exists for research and development of systems with low costs and low maintenance, specifically designed for DC and TC.}

Based on a village study in Tanzania, the effects of decentralized forest management on forest conservation, rural livelihoods and good governance are evaluated. Tree growth is estimated to exceed harvest, and forest utilization appears effectively controlled. Forest revenues cover the costs of management and finance local public services, but the underlying taxes and regulations have made the poorest worse off. Governance outcomes are also ambiguous. Revenues are administered transparently, but village leaders are coercive toward forest dependent minorities. The case provides a rare example of how decentralized forest management works in Africa when meaningful powers are devolved to local communities.}

Evolvable control systems face the demands for modularity, decentralization, reconfigurabil-ity and responsiveness pointed out by the Industrie 4.0 initiative. In these systems, the self-organization model assumes a critical issue to ensure the correct evolution of the system structure into different operating configurations. ADACOR holonic manufacturing control architecture introduces an adaptive production control mechanism that balances between two states, combining the optimization provided by hierarchical structures with agility and responsiveness to condition changes offered by decentralized structures. This paper describes the switching mechanism that supports this dynamic balance and particularly the local and global driving forces for the self-organization model. The proposed model was experimentally tested in a small scale production system.}

We review this evolution over four periods noting inevitable trade-offs and tensions in a system of autonomous centers and sovereign donors, in developing common research strategies, appropriate lines of management, and aligning resources around agreed priorities. As a result, organizational changes have not met expectations and funding has continued to fragment around short-term payoffs at the expense of producing global public goods over the long term. The paper concludes with suggestions for building on the lessons of organizational reform to improve the collective action performance of funders and centers to drive and sustain needed changes.}

Recently, however, organizational experiments in radical decentralization have gained mainstream consideration, giving rise to a need for new theory and new research. This paper reviews the literature on less-hierarchical organizing and identifies three categories of research: post-bureaucratic organizations, humanistic management and organizational democracy. Despite this extensive prior work, scholarly understanding of radical decentralization remains limited. Using the term self-managing organizations to capture efforts that radically decentralize authority in a formal and systematic way throughout the organization, we set forth a research agenda to better understand less-hierarchical organizing at its limits.}

Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric’s test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.}

This allows us to achieve properties such as preventing the re-selling of data (e.g., partial data, combined data, and leaked data). We also design five algorithms to automatically guarantee data sharing fairness and proactively protect data copyright, by using smart contracts. In other words, several new security features are introduced to existing transaction schemes, while still achieving feasible performance. The response times for each key step of smart contract in the proposed scheme is between 0.41 s and 0.91 s.}

This paper highlights an aspect which has not surfaced in the organization theory literature on centralization and decentralization — that the pendulous movement between the two is driven, as much as anything else, by an inherent “internal” dynamic between and within the nature of the written terms, and within the nature of human beings.}

In the current study, we examine transitions theory and its implications for the progress of decentralized energy systems in Japan in the period after the Fukushima accident of 2011. Empirical data from a targeted nation-wide survey is used to examine the progress and change in consumer preference and behavior since the disaster, as possible evidence for the potential transition paths likely to be occurring. Importantly, this study utilizes data that examines a spectrum of urban–rural and disaster–non-disaster areas in order to explore whether any differences in response patterns were present. Results indicate that although the desire of stakeholders has been to change the energy system, there are barriers to transformation. Variation between rural and urban sites and between disaster-affected and unaffected areas was examined, indicating that (at least under the chosen classification) there was surprisingly little difference. The results have implications for understanding transitions at a much broader level, and imply that, if the empirical data is a useful indicator, Japan is within a locked-in or reorganization transition. In order to move to a more radical conversion type change a new approach is likely to be required to nurture niche innovations effectively.}

The success of efforts to decentralize governance responsibilities hinges upon the incentives of local politicians. We test this argument by studying the experiences of forestry sector decentralization in Bolivia and Guatemala. We analyze the survey responses of 200 mayors and show that local-level institutional incentives are systematically linked to variations in local politicians’ interest and investment decisions in the forestry sector. Further, we find that a decentralization policy that transfers very limited decision-making powers to local governments stifles local interest in organizing resource governance activities.}

The arbitrary arrival and serving rates of tasks on peers impedes the high throughput in large-scale P2P Grids. We propose a novel autonomous resource allocation scheme, which can maximize the throughput of self-organizing P2P Grid systems. Our design possesses three key features: (1) high adaptability to dynamic environment by proactive and convex-optimal estimation of nodes’ volatile states; (2) minimized task migration conflict probability (upper bound can be limited to 2%) of over-utilized nodes individually shifting surplus loads; (3) a load-status conscious gossip protocol for optimizing distributed resource discovery effect. Based on a real-life user’s workload and capacity distribution, the simulation results show that our approach could get significantly improved throughput with 23.6–47.1% reduction on unprocessed workload compared to other methods. We also observe high scalability of our solution under dynamic peer-churning situations.}

abstract = {The idea of creation of more decentralized power system has been circulating for a while, but started to materialise only during the recent years, when massive introduction of support schemes for RES has started to move more and more generation into the distribution network. Apart from the environmental benefits, this has created several challenges for planning and operation of the conventional power system. Furthermore, the growing recognition of necessity for optimization across different energy carriers for example “ETIP SNET Vision 2050” is also pointing towards more and more decentralized system. This chapter presents an overview of the main architectures and concepts for smart decentralized energy systems, through the critical analysis of recent documents such as Pan-European roadmaps (ETIP-SNET) and scenarios (TYNDP2020), results of R&D projects and regulatory documents (“Clean Energy for all Europeans”). The chapter is organized in four parts and starts with background for decentralization: driving forces, trends, and foreseen benefits as well as potential challenges and pitfalls. The second section starts with an overview of different levels of decentralization. The decentralized architecture combined with new ICT infrastructure (including machine learning), opens possibility for new and more efficient control approaches (balancing and voltage). This issue has been studied for example in ELECTRA IRP project, elaborating a cellular structure with dedicated set of novel controls for the power system. This section will further look at the market alternatives and the areas with several unresolved issues and gaps, which must be explored further and require an immediate attention from the research community. The following section will present views of several key stakeholders on decentralization of the power system. It appears that transformation to partially or fully decentralized power system will require certain changes of the present and creation of new roles and responsibilities among actors on the power market. Some of these modifications has been already introduced and formalised in the most recent recast of “Clean Energy for all Europeans.” The section will further present somewhat different opinions about this among the involved stakeholders, which have been expressed in several position papers. The final section makes conclusions and links the content to other chapters of the book.}

Today most Grids adopt a centralized or hierarchical model for their information system, but this model is characterized by poor scalability, resiliency and load-balancing features. Nowadays the research and development community is heading towards the use of scalable information systems based on distributed models such as the decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) model and the super-peer model. If the former is adopted, each node can act both as a client and a server as it can generate discovery requests and also respond to requests issued by other peers. Requests and responses are forwarded with a hop-by-hop mechanism by ad hoc Grid Services hosted by Grid nodes. The super-peer model is a recently proposed approach that combines features of centralized and P2P models. A super-peer acts as a server for a single Grid organization, and publishes metadata describing the resources provided by the nodes of that organization. At the same time, super-peers connect to each other to form a P2P network at a higher level. This paper analyzes information systems based on three alternative models: the hierarchical, the decentralized P2P, and the super-peer model. A performance evaluation of such models is reported, and afterwards a performance comparison is discussed in order to analyze the pros and cons of each solution.}

In addition, our findings indicate diversity in the effects of fiscal decentralization, in that it appears related to lower deficits in countries with higher levels of corruption but not in less corrupt countries. Our results suggest that bringing the government closer to the people through fiscal decentralization in relatively corrupt countries leads to more responsible fiscal management.}

This paper investigates the hypothesis that a shift towards a higher degree of fiscal autonomy of sub-national governments could improve health outcomes, as measured by infant mortality rates. Italy is used as a case study since responsibilities for healthcare have been decentralized to regions, though the central government still retains a key role in ensuring all citizens uniform access to health services throughout the country. A linear fixed-effects regression model with robust standard errors is employed for a panel of 20 regions over the period 1996–2012 (340 observations in the full sample). Decentralization is proxied by two different indicators, capturing the degree of decision-making autonomy in the allocation of tax revenues and the extent to which regions rely on fiscal transfers from the central government. The results show that a higher proportion of tax revenues raised and/or controlled locally as well as a lower transfer dependency from the central government are consistently associated with lower infant mortality rates, ceteris paribus. The marginal benefit from fiscal decentralization, however, is not constant but depends on the level of regional wealth, favouring poorest regions. In terms of policy implications, this study outlines how the effectiveness of decentralization in improving health outcomes is contingent on the characteristics of the context in which the process takes place.}

abstract = {In many European countries, since the World War II, there has been a trend towards decentralization of health policy to lower levels of governments, while more recently there have been re-centralization processes. Whether re-centralization will be the new paradigm of European health policy or not is difficult to say. In the Italian National Health Service (SSN) decentralization raised two related questions that might be interesting for the international debate on decentralization in health care: (a) what sort of regulatory framework and institutional balances are required to govern decentralization in health care in a heterogeneous country under tough budget constraints? (b) how can it be ensured that the most advanced parts of the country remain committed to solidarity, supporting the weakest ones? To address these questions this article describes the recent trends in SSN funding and expenditure, it reviews the strategy adopted by the Italian government for governing the decentralization process and discusses the findings to draw policy conclusions. The main lessons emerging from this experience are that: (1) when the differences in administrative and policy skills, in socio-economic standards and social capital are wide, decentralization may lead to undesirable divergent evolution paths; (2) even in decentralized systems, the role of the Central government can be very important to contain health expenditure; (3) a strong governance of the Central government may help and not hinder the enforcement of decentralization; and (4) supporting the weakest Regions and maintaining inter-regional solidarity is hard but possible. In Italy, despite an increasing role of the Central government in steering the SSN, the pattern of regional decentralization of health sector decision making does not seem at risk. Nevertheless, the Italian case confirms the complexity of decentralization and re-centralization processes that sometimes can be paradoxically reinforcing each other.}

abstract = {The increased demand and complexity of services operating within open distributed environments has emphasized the need for systems that are adaptive, self-organizing and more robust. In order to address these issues some agent oriented approaches have adopted ideas from natural systems as possible solutions. The introduction of biological properties, especially birth and death of agents as expected events, generates an extremely dynamic environment where it is difficult to maintain the overall connectivity of the overlay network and facilitate efficient discovery processes. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a selective discovery mechanism in a distributed bio-inspired multi-agent community through a simulation study. The primary focus of the study is on the impacts which death and (sexual/asexual) reproduction events have on the effectiveness of the discovery process in different overlay networks.}

Yet, managing such ecosystems in complex inter- and intra-organizational settings requires a profound, yet little understood, shift in the role and capabilities of internal organizational functions. This study aims to investigate the composition of ecosystem management capabilities. We employ an in-depth single case study of a leading global solution provider in the automotive and transport industry, based on 51 interviews across the ecosystem management function, various organizational functions, and ecosystem actors. Our analysis, rooted in the dynamic capabilities perspective, highlights three sets of crucial ecosystem management capabilities: ecosystem foresight, ecosystem integration, and ecosystem governance. We further detail the underlying routines and micro-foundational activities enabling these capabilities. By illuminating the key capabilities, routines, and activities of ecosystem management in a dynamic context, this study makes significant contributions to management and strategy research on ecosystems and ecosystem management in rapidly evolving business landscapes.}

abstract = {Due to the significant environmental impact of power production from fossil fuels and nuclear fission, future energy systems will increasingly rely on distributed and renewable energy sources (RES). The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand–supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets.}

From this fieldwork, we found that most local institutions are not ready to fully receive forest management rights transfer. They face lack of capabilities to formulate their internal regulation and negotiation processes against disputed issues. This condition leads to conflict. Therefore, conflicts are becoming more frequent among people, among local institutions, and between local institution and local government. There is an absence of low-cost conflict resolution. Consequently, households are facing uncertainty in the access to forest resources. The powerful households get higher benefit than the poorer households, indicating a continuation of elite capture, although the decentralization policy was enacted more than a decade ago.}

abstract = {Background
The cell and gene therapy (CGT) field is at a critical juncture. Clinical successes have underpinned the requirement for developing manufacturing capacity suited to patient-specific therapies that can satisfy the eventual demand post-launch. Decentralised or ‘redistributed’ manufacturing divides manufacturing capacity across geographic regions, promising local, responsive manufacturing, customised to the end user, and is an attractive solution to overcome challenges facing the CGT manufacturing chain.
Methods
A study was undertaken building on previous, so far unpublished, semi-structured interviews with key opinion leaders in advanced therapy research, manufacturing and clinical practice. The qualitative findings were applied to construct a cost of goods model that permitted the cost impact of regional siting to be combined with variable and fixed costs of manufacture of a mesenchymal stromal cell product.
Results
Using the United Kingdom as an exemplar, cost disparities between regions were examined. Per patient dose costs of ~£1,800 per 75,000,000 cells were observed. Financial savings from situating the facility outside of London allow 25–41 additional staff or 24–35 extra manufacturing vessels to be employed. Decentralised quality control to mitigate site-to-site variation was examined. Partial decentralisation of quality control was observed to be financially possible and an attractive option for facilitating release ‘at risk’.
Discussion
There are important challenges that obstruct the easy adoption of decentralised manufacturing that have the potential to undermine the market success of otherwise promising products. By using the United Kingdom as an exemplar, the modelled data provide a framework to inform similar regional policy considerations across other global territories.}

However, current efforts have, at most, only addressed the first two problem dimensions concurrently and do not account for the propagative effects that uncertain scheduling outcomes in one dimension can have on another dimension. In addition, existing approaches for airline disruption management include human specialists who decide on necessary corrective actions for airline schedule disruptions on the day of operation. However, human specialists are limited in their ability to process copious amounts of information imperative for making robust decisions that simultaneously address all problem dimensions during disruption management. Therefore, there is a need to augment the decision-making capabilities of a human specialist with quantitative and qualitative tools that can rationalize complex interactions amongst all dimensions in airline disruption management, and provide objective insights to the specialists in the airline operations control center. To that effect, we provide a discussion and demonstration of an agnostic and systematic paradigm for enabling expeditious simultaneously-integrated recovery of all problem dimensions during airline disruption management, through an intelligent multi-agent system that employs principles from artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. Results indicate that our paradigm for simultaneously-integrated recovery executes in polynomial time and is effective when all the flights in the airline route network are disrupted.}

This paper attempts to determine the municipal level impact of the 1994 Law 142 water and sewerage services reforms on child mortality and service coverage. The objective of these reforms was to transfer service provision from the municipalities to specialized companies. These reforms were undertaken within the 1990s decentralization process which established that the provision of water and sewerage services was the responsibility of local governments. The results obtained indicate that municipalities that reformed exhibit a slower reduction of child mortality rates and lower increases in water coverage than the ones that did not reform.}

To avoid an unavailable coordination center of the whole network, a DD-ARO model is firstly proposed based on the parallelizing-distributed (PD) framework, which allocates the task of tie-line power coordination in the virtual center to the neighboring stakeholders. According to the properties of nonlinear ARO, a modified analytical target cascading method is further developed to formulate the consistency constraints on shared tie-lines, thus guaranteeing the optimality and enhancing the solution quality of the DD-ARO model. Finally, an iterative solution algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the resulting multi-level non-convex DD-ARO model. Case studies and computational results illustrate the effectiveness of the DD-ARO approach for an AC/DC hybrid multi-microgrid system under normal and faulty communications.}

Both IMRs and the sex ratio at birth suggest reported data constitute a floor or minimal level of demographic distress across provinces with millions of missing females not fully included in the data. China's one-child policy leads to not only underreporting by families but also reporting abuse by local officials who want to be promoted. The hukou system and unbalanced government development policies exacerbate the issue.}

The next step in this trend is to decentralize ADSs to microgrids (MGs). This paper aims to present a review on the recent advancements in the development of ADSs and MGs. In this respect, the regulatory requirements and economic concepts, by which the traditional passive DNs are evolved into ADSs, are categorized and illustrated first.

abstract = {Smallholder irrigation schemes are largely supply driven such that they exclude the beneficiaries on the management decisions and the choice of the irrigation schemes that would best suit their local needs. It is against this background that the decentralisation framework and the Dublin Principles on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) emphasise the need for a participatory approach to water management. The Zimbabwean government has gone a step further in decentralising the management of irrigation schemes, that is promoting farmer managed irrigation schemes so as to ensure effective management of scarce community based land and water resources. The study set to investigate the way in which the Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme is managed with specific emphasis on the role of the Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), the level of accountability and the powers devolved to the IMC. Merrey’s 2008 critique of IWRM also informs this study which views irrigation as going beyond infrastructure by looking at how institutions and decision making processes play out at various levels including at the irrigation scheme level. The study was positioned on the hypothesis that ‘decentralised or autonomous irrigation management enhances the sustainability and effectiveness of irrigation schemes’. To validate or falsify the stated hypothesis, data was gathered using desk research in the form of reviewing articles, documents from within the scheme and field research in the form of questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and field observation. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to analyse data quantitatively, whilst content analysis was utilised to analyse qualitative data whereby data was analysed thematically. Comparative analysis was carried out as Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme was compared with other smallholder irrigation scheme’s experiences within Zimbabwe and the Sub Saharan African region at large. The findings were that whilst the scheme is a model of a decentralised entity whose importance lies at improving food security and employment creation within the community, it falls short in representing a downwardly accountable decentralised irrigation scheme. The scheme is faced with various challenges which include its operation which is below capacity utilisation, absence of specialised technical human personnel to address infrastructural breakdowns, uneven distribution of water pressure, incapacitated Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), absence of a locally legitimate constitution, compromised beneficiary participation and unclear lines of communication between various institutions involved in water management. Understanding decentralization is important since one of the key tenets of IWRM is stakeholder participation which the decentralization framework interrogates.}

We argue that self-rule (or the authority that subnational units exercise in their own territory) is closely associated with vertical accountability and positively affects voting participation. Moreover, we find that political dimensions of self-rule matter more than fiscal dimensions. Shared-rule (or the authority that subnational units exercise in the country as a whole) has no significant effect on participation since it is more closely related to horizontal accountability. We test our theory in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries using a hierarchical model with 2010 data at the national and individual-level.}

Many countries have emphasized hierarchical control or different exit and voice mechanisms to increase accountability of educational systems. We build a framework for understanding accountability reforms and develop three illustrative Latin American cases representing distinct approaches (Chile, Nicaragua, and Bogotá, Colombia). We highlight the complexity of institutional change and the value of flexible reform models. Using an institutional perspective we examine the components of accountability; their complex interrelationships; and the importance of design details, implementation, and monitoring. We argue for balancing clear and efficient top-down monitoring and enforcement with other, less punitive accountability mechanisms including strong local quality support systems.}

Though easy to implement and control, centralized systems are difficult and expensive to scale in terms of the number of devices and the flow of information. This set of circumstances calls for a decentralized and distributed architecture for realizing such networked systems. However, due to the absence of global information in decentralized systems, one of the primary challenges is to find the best solution for problems distributed across the devices which are part of the CPS. Since the problems are distributed and no participating device has access to the full information, the devices may need to interact and share the information to select the best solution for a problem occurred. In this paper, we present a decentralized and distributed mechanism, which adapts to a stream of varying problems and continuously evolves and learns the best mappings between the problems and their associated solutions. The proposed approach integrates the concepts propounded in the three major Immune theories and can cater to real-world situations. The evolved mappings are shared across the physical network, thereby accelerating the search for the best set of solutions. In order to validate the performance of the proposed mechanism, we present the results obtained from solving a problem of sorting a stream of varying data in an emulated decentralized and distributed manner. To substantiate its working in real-world scenarios, we also describe the results obtained by embodying the system in real robots that discover the best path-following algorithms.}

It was recently shown that building sanitation systems in phases is more cost effective than one robust design. This phasing can take place by building small autonomous decentralised units that operate closer to the actual demand. Research has shown that variability and uncertainty in urban development does affect the cost effectiveness of this approach. Previous studies do not, however, consider the entire sanitation system from collection to treatment. The aim of this study is to assess the economic performance of three sanitation systems with different scales and systems characteristics under a variety of urban development pathways. Three systems are studied: (I) a centralised conventional activated sludge treatment, (II) a community on site source separation grey water and black water treatment and (III) a hybrid with grey water treatment at neighbourhood scale and black water treatment off site. A modelling approach is taken that combines a simulation of greenfield urban growth, a model of the wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure design properties and a model that translates design parameters into discounted asset lifetime costs. Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the economic performance under uncertain development trends. Results show that the conventional system outperforms both of the other systems when total discounted lifetime costs are assessed, because it benefits from economies of scale. However, when population growth is lower than expected, the source-separated system is more cost effective, because of reduced idle capacity. The hybrid system is not competitive under any circumstance due to the costly double piping and treatment.}

In-house efficacy of such systems has been greatly improved due to lean six-sigma methodologies; however, wider scale distribution and supply has undergone little to no transformation over the past century. Research pertaining to distributed manufacture, cloud-manufacture and reconfigurable systems have provided several decentralized models using traditional manufacturing capabilities. Due to practical limitations they have not been fully realized to date. This paper outlines the emerging concept and scope for hybrid manufacturing platforms – systems using a plurality of processes on a single motion platform, to manufacture products in a decentralized network. Necessity of on-machine inspection is highlighted, outlining the potential of generic artifact machine calibration and verification of parts made. A robust experimental method using a novel hybrid manufacturing approach is used to realize the post-process adaptation of subsequent parts and demonstrates significant improvement with adapted features being cut within 15μm of nominal position, compared to the original 300μm error. Social, economic and environmental ramifications of adopting such a system are highlighted. The combination of several key processes will allow users to manufacture parts with minimal intervention. A move to personal fabrication would allow greater customization and convenience for the end user; however, the issues of copyright and loss of economy of scale would inhibit mass uptake in the near-future. Growing interest by enthusiasts and early adopters will continue to make an impact on the way the populace views manufacture.}

It encourages the consideration of cultural framework of meaning; these local cultural references structure the governance modalities of a society, understood in terms of the modalities of exercise of power in a given group (state, company, local authority, etc.). It advocates the necessity to move from a technic-prone approach in the implementation of institutional changes towards a socio-cultural approach that integrates the local expectations of what “good governance” should be and on which depends the legitimacy of institutions and their appropriation by local populations.}

abstract = {The dramatic reduction in the cost of renewable energy production during the 2020s, especially in roof-top solar, followed by a similar cost reduction trajectory with batteries, suggested to many a smooth transition from nuclear and fossil fuels to solar and wind. But centralized and blunt policy and price signals including massive worldwide subsidies for incumbent industries have perpetuated established patterns of much of the generation and distribution system remaining far from where it is consumed, leading to the higher electricity network and grid stabilization costs. To allow renewables to be scaled efficiently, variable renewable energy, such as solar and wind, need to be consumed much closer to where they are produced enabling a much closer link to the consumer. Time and place price signals are needed to make this happen thus creating the need for a transactive electricity system. This change to how the power system works is fundamentally different so resistance to change in the incumbent conventional and centralized energy industry became glaring as renewable power emerged as critical to a climate-stable economy. A Transactive Electricity system challenges the whole centralized power business model and has significant social and security implications but promises multiple benefits. This chapter suggests that the transition is aided by a fundamental overhaul of how the distributed market model can operate and, in particular, how digital systems, including machine learning, AI, and blockchain, potentially support renewables becoming locally dispatchable through transactive energy markets. We provide initial results of trials using the “time and place transactive model”. This model can first leapfrog into places where regulatory push back from traditional grid and supply interests is least intense and then expand across energy markets in a Kuhnian way, creating a new energy paradigm.}

We argue that investment in transport and communication facilitates exchange with outsiders and improves the outside options of community members, thus making it more difficult to sustain intra-community cooperation. Consequently, communities which enjoy a high level of cooperation in collective activities benefit less from investing in transport and communication and are more inclined to invest in social infrastructure.}

Uncertainty on specific actions and strategies remains, leading to a research-implementation gap. For Ecuador, one of the key challenges to local adaptation are the institutional capacities of the decentralized autonomous governments (GAD, Spanish acronym). Therefore, the objective of this study is firstly to apply a capacity development strategy developed by GIZ (2013a) in the context of limited knowledge and resources and secondly gain a deeper understanding of climate action in Ecuador on a provincial level. The case study is based on an experimental participatory workshop in the coastal province of Santa Elena, Ecuador. The applied methodology has three components: firstly, semi-structured expert interviews on climate action in Ecuador; secondly, the participatory workshops with technicians and employees of the provincial government, its analysis together with a pre-, post- and two-months-after the workshop follow-up survey; thirdly, the analysis of the workshop is complemented by a peer validation of the co-facilitators. The analysis of the workshop suggests that in a context of limited institutional capacity, an understanding of climate change terminology, vulnerability and adaptive capacity is crucial to interpret predictions and to motivate action. Additionally, results indicate that pairing the content of the seminar with elements of project management might also strengthen local planning and longevity of rural development measures. Overall, the methodology of GIZ might therefore not be suitable in the local context due to its fast pace and difficult terminology. A more promising approach to foster local climate action is the Design-Thinking (DT) methodology due to its easier accessibility. Based on the insights of the case study a capacity development strategy incorporating DT offers lessons learnt for practitioners aiming to promote local climate action in comparable institutional contexts of limited knowledge and resources. As limited knowledge and resources are often main barriers to climate action, developing capacity building strategies will in turn foster climate action.}

This article thoroughly examines the progress, difficulties, and potential breakthroughs in the integration of AI technology with smart grids to enhance the use of hydrogen energy . The study focuses on utilising AI technologies such as deep learning and machine learning to optimise the processes of generating, distributing, and utilising energy. The discoveries stemming from this investigation facilitate prognostic maintenance, instantaneous decision-making, and effective demand-side management, augmenting the durability and eco-friendliness of energy systems. Nevertheless, this auspicious panorama is surrounded by significant obstacles. Significant issues develop regarding data privacy and security when sensitive information is sent over AI-powered grid systems. Interoperability difficulties necessitate standardising the communication protocols to enable smooth data flow. Additionally, further research is essential to tackle the technological limitations of AI in grid management. This article presents a forward-thinking viewpoint on the incorporation of AI-enhanced smart grid technologies, with a focus on future expectations. Autonomous energy management systems offer improved flexibility, proactive maintenance, and flexible energy distribution. Simultaneously, the combination of Edge AI and decentralisation facilitates the establishment of energy generating and storage facilities at local levels. This helps to make immediate decisions, minimises delays, and improves the durability of the power grid. The report emphasises the pivotal importance of governmental and regulatory factors in directing these advancements. The foundation for a safe and flexible power system is established by data privacy legislation, grid modernisation initiatives, and incentives for hydrogen energy. The essay promotes energy market reforms, technological neutrality, and measures that improve grid resilience as a means of achieving environmental sustainability. The integration of hydrogen energy into smart infrastructure is facilitated by AI, and strategic planning and collaborative design are crucial for achieving a resilient, sustainable, and efficient energy future.

On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.}

These ECUs provide many sophisticated systems such as engine control, antilock braking systems, etc. This fact has increased the automotive embedded networks complexity. Another important issue in this field is the necessity to define a suitable diagnosis strategy to prevent faults propagation. The integration of diagnosis functions into the automotive embedded systems contributes to overload the communication protocols. In this context, solutions for checking latencies entailed by extra-data traffic are urgently needed. Throughout this paper, a novel approach for the automotive diagnosis design, which is based on the Controller Area Network (CAN) analysis, is detailed. The principal contribution of this work consists in developing a decentralized fault diagnosis and studying its data traffic effect on messages deadlines. Our novel method, “CAN real-time analysis based on decentralized fault diagnosis”, is a step ahead to a reliable early phase automotive design. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is applied on a model of an advanced anti-crash system. The proposed design methodology presents several advantages. It optimizes the schedulability of tasks and facilitates the design validation. Moreover, a realistic hardware-in-the-loop simulation is carried out to validate our work.}

abstract = {The European Union (EU) 2020 Energy Strategy calls for reducing the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the share of renewable energy, and achieving significant energy savings. All EU countries must also increase the share of renewable energy in their transport sectors. EU Member States are at various stages of compliance. This chapter analyses the situations in Slovenia. It analyses relevant governance structures in each country and identifies where regulation is conducive to the above goals and where it is acting as a barrier. Given that deregulation and decentralization are part of achieving the EU’s energy strategy, the chapter examines where Slovenia stands on that front and what specific initiatives and projects are underway toward greater deregulation and decentralization. Such initiatives include rollouts of smart metering systems and electric vehicles as well as launching demand response schemes. The chapter also addresses relevant data protection concerns.}

There are a number of different factors that must be considered when developing innovation adoption models for organizations. This paper briefly describes each of the relevant variables and combines them into a discrete choice model for predicting the adoption rate of CATs by a hypothetical sample of transportation organizations. The model incorporates new peer effect modeling techniques to simulate the competition and informal communication network. Preliminary results suggest that organizations which are larger are less likely to change their decisions due to the decisions of other, competing organizations, whereas smaller organizations are more easily influenced by the decisions of larger organizations. The methodology developed in this paper produces reasonable results using a hypothetical dataset, and the methodology has been designed to be transferrable to any number of organizational innovations.}

abstract = {The widespread diffusion of Online Social Networks has given unforeseen opportunities for their users to share contents and mutually interact. However, current platforms offer inadequate guarantees as far as concerns the privacy of their users. To address these issues and leave to the users more control on their data, several recent proposals suggest to decentralize the storage of social data, aiming at leaving their control entirely to their owners. This approach has lead to the definition of Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs), ranging from completely decentralized solutions, i.e. P2P solutions, to hybrid systems integrating external and private resources for storing user data. While DOSNs allow users to have more control over their data, they raise new challenges concerning the management and availability of social data. Guaranteeing data availability in a highly dynamic environment, defining proper algorithms for information diffusion and guaranteeing data privacy in a distributed setting are currently open problems in this area. This survey presents an overview of these challenges and of the main solutions presented in the literature. Existing proposals are classified taking into account the strategies adopted to manage social data, focusing on the data availability and on information diffusion. The survey also presents the new privacy issues arising in DOSNs. Finally, an overview of the main open issues in this research area is presented.}

After analyzing convergence and communication requirement of the algorithm, a set of numerical simulations is provided to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

These improvements emphasize the nature of decentralized property rights, linking the outputs of decentralization with its outcomes and the inclusion of contextual factors. Applying MAPAF to analyze outputs and outcomes from two major decentralized forest policies in Ethiopia, i.e., delegation and devolution, has demonstrated the following strengths of the framework. First, by incorporating vital bundles of property rights into APAF, MAPAF creates a common ground for exploring and comparing the extent of democratization achieved by different decentralizing reforms. Second, the inclusion of social and environmental outcomes in MAPAF makes it possible to link the output of decentralization with local level outcomes. Finally, the addition of contextual factors enhances MAPAF's explanatory power by providing room for investigating exogenous factors other than democratization that contribute to the outcomes of decentralization reforms.}

The global network to eradicate blindness emerged out of the work of Western and South Asian professionals to eradicate smallpox which was endemic in South Asia. The history of the emergence of the global network to eradicate blindness demonstrates a shift from vertical command and control public health programs directed by the WHO, to the decentralized public health services originating in non-profit, non-governmental organizations and coordinated by the WHO. The WHO constitution started with a federal regionalist structure that encouraged collaboration and coordination with NGOs. In South Asia in particular, epidemiologists and general medical practitioners moved from eradicating smallpox through the WHO to creating their own domestic and international NGOs based in various countries with a mission to control blindness in South Asia and Africa. In 1975, pushed by the WHO Director General, these new NGOs in turn joined with individual ophthalmologists and existing blind member associations to form the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. Thus, the WHO was shaped by, and shaping, international NGOs such as the IAPB. The IAPB pushed for the formation of the WHO Prevention of Blindness program. This was the earliest example of how the IAPB facilitates bottom-up agenda-setting in the WHO. In 1980, when the WHO officially closed the smallpox program, the Prevention of Blindness program first received independent funding. Presently, the IAPB acts as a decentralized arm of the WHO.}

Testable predictions about the relations between these characteristics and firms' decentralization decisions are developed and tested. The evidence presented is consistent with our predictions and is robust to different ways of measuring variables.}

In authoritarian regimes, the highest-priority political task is that of restraining political competition and securing power in the hands of the incumbent. This task incentivizes politicians to restrict political decentralization (or at least block reforms promoting such decentralization). At the same time, external economic pressures (e.g. globalization) place the task of national competitiveness in the global markets on the agenda, and increase incentives for fiscal and administrative decentralization. Thus, political and economic pressures create contradicting incentives, and in weighing costs and benefits, politicians in different authoritarian regimes make different choices that lead to variation in the form, degree and success of decentralization/centralization policies. In this article we compare authoritarian decentralization in Russia and Kazakhstan.}

abstract = {There is widespread agreement in policy and academic circles that energy systems in many jurisdictions are becoming more decentralized. Energy decentralization may be occurring among US and European municipal governments as they establish energy companies to serve customers and promote energy sector decarbonization. This paper reviews different forms of energy decentralization identified in the literature. It then reviews and compares municipal energy company development and activity in three jurisdictions with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Differences in institutional context, we argue, explain much of the variation in municipal energy business models and, by extension, the ways in which energy decentralization is occurring. Specifically, we show that the opportunity to take on monopoly functions where municipal companies are not competing with other market players, and thereby face fewer financial and operational risks, enable municipal energy companies to promote energy decentralization in business activities. On the contrary, these opportunities are limited where municipal energy companies must compete in markets with other players. The findings confirm that public policy institutions play a critical role in energy decentralization and demonstrate how studying commercial activities through a business model lens can help reveal decentralization dynamics. The results are also intended for cities considering new municipal ventures, especially where cities are trying to learn lessons from international examples. They suggest an explicit consideration of differences in policy and regulatory contexts.}

The worldwide trend towards the devolution of state authority to sub-national administrations that has accompanied globalization has been strongest in Asia and Africa, where political reforms have had profound implications for the efficient and equitable distribution of resources. In times of disaster in particular, decentralisation is often portrayed as the preferred means for bringing government closer to the people, and is tied to an expectation that people and their communities will become more empowered to politically articulate their needs and priorities through public decision-making. Decentralised decision-making is also expected to more quickly respond to environmental disasters due to proximity to events and better ability to mobilize social resources and local knowledge in planning for, responding to and gaining resilience for future catastrophic events. However, decentralisation defined as the devolution of political power and financial capacities to autonomously govern local constituencies remains uneven, and such issues as political repression and corruption are a concern at local levels just as they are at national scales. As environmental disasters impact urbanising populations at multiple scales, the need differentiate different modes and contexts of decentralisation to better understand connections between national and local governance regimes is integral to the pursuit of more inclusive and effective policy choices in dealing with the myriad causes and far-reaching consequences of disasters in Asia's rapidly urbanising societies.}

To cope with critically deficient water services, a local NGO supported by different donors has promoted decentralized water systems (DWS) that have spread in the city outskirts, based on a model with original features compared to other African experiences. Here, we intend to provide an empirically grounded and analytically sound inquiry into the relevance, efficiency and sustainability of these DWSs in the context of the megacity of Kinshasa. First, we analyze water provision data from the national water utility and compare these to the detailed operational results of the DWSs to estimate the magnitude and efficiency of this alternative mechanism. Second, the principles identified by Elinor Ostrom as being crucial for institutions to successfully manage commons provide us with a fruitful analytic framework to assess DWS performance and sustainability. We show that some of these criteria are broadly met, but the fulfillment of other criteria is still uncertain. We conclude with a balanced assessment of the efficiency and sustainability of this approach and identify the key challenges.}
