abstract = {The growing popularity of online social media (OSM) has led to the creation of a wide amount of social media platforms. In this context, the increasing competition among platforms and the emergence of decentralized alternatives such as Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM), have led to more frequent user migrations: individuals tend to switch platforms in search of improved features, content, or communities. Therefore there has been increasing interest in user migration studies modeling and predicting user migration. However, user migration, especially in blockchain-based platforms remains an understudied problem. Existing methods rely on user activity to derive interaction graphs and then address the user migration prediction problem as a node classification task, where user decisions are encoded as node labels. While the performance look promising, there are currently two important research gaps: i) there is no work using graph neural networks, the state-of-the-art in machine learning on graphs; and ii) there is a lack of methods designed to improve prediction performance in the case of class imbalance, i.e. the presence of dominant behavior among the ones to predict. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict user migration in BOSM. We model the data as a directed temporal multilayer graph, capturing social and monetary interactions among users. To address the problem of class imbalance in node classification, we introduce a data-level balancing technique following an undersampling approach. The evaluation, conducted on data describing user migration across blockchain online social media platforms, shows that graph neural networks are a suitable machine learning approach to perform user migration prediction. Furthermore, the proposed undersampling approach improves predictive power on severely imbalanced data. These results highlight how graph neural networks are effective in predicting user migration, without the need for manual feature engineering and in the absence of user information. Our methodology holds potential for applications beyond user migration, such as fraud detection and bot detection, and opens up venues for further research in other prediction tasks in online social networks and blockchain-based systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a crypto Non Fungible Token (NFT) for real estate information. Current issues with real estate are the lack of asset information availability, and once data is retrieved, its veracity. Moreover, data can be out of data or artificially manipulated for an economic benefit. An example could be the fire alarm inspection logs. On the other hand, the main benefits of tokenisation are 1) decentralisation from a single source of authority, 2) encryption of data that avoids tampering, and 3) digital proof of ownership. The NFT registers real estate static and dynamic information to be traded in the data marketplace between the different users and stakeholders such as investors, occupiers, insurers and property managers. The information registered in the NFT contains real estate deeds, transactions and relevant parameters that change over time. The infrastructure of the proposed real estate NFT consists of a private token in a private blockchain entirely developed for this application rather than ERC-1155 or ERC-721; therefore, a new crypto token is created. Furthermore, the consensus protocol is a mixture between the proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms by choosing random validators with staked Cryptocurrency already, such as Ethereum. Experimental results show that the increment of the NFT at every transaction does not produce an equal increment of mining time or mining nonce, making the NFT predictable for higher complex models.},

abstract = {The integration of bots in Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) fosters efficiency and automation. However, their use is also associated with predatory trading and market manipulation, and can pose threats to system integrity. It is therefore essential to understand the extent of bot deployment in DLTs; despite this, current detection systems are predominantly rule-based and lack flexibility. In this study, we present a novel approach that utilizes machine learning for the detection of financial bots on the Ethereum platform. First, we systematize existing scientific literature and collect anecdotal evidence to establish a taxonomy for financial bots, comprising 7 categories and 24 subcategories. Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human and 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The highest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an average cluster purity of 82.6\%, while the highest-performing model for binary classification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83\%. Our machine learning-based detection mechanism contributes to understanding the Ethereum ecosystem dynamics by providing additional insights into the current bot landscape.},

abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) or blockchains have been steadily emerging and providing innovation in the past decade for several use cases, ranging from financial networks, to notarization, or trustworthy execution via smart contracts. DLTs are enticing due to their properties of decentralization, non-repudiation, and auditability (transparency). These properties are of high potential to access control systems that can be implemented on-chain, and are executed without infringement and full transparency.While it remains uncertain which use cases will truly turn out to be viable, many use cases such as financial transactions can benefit from integrating certain restrictions via access control on the blockchain. In addition, smart contracts may in the future present security risks that are currently yet unknown. As a solution, access control policies can provide flexibility in the execution flow when adopted by smart contracts.In this paper, we present our DEDACS architecture which provides decentralized and dynamic access control for smart contracts in a policy-based manner. Our access control is expressive as it features policies, and dynamic as the environment or users can be changed, or alternative policies can be assigned to smart contracts. DEDACS ensures that our access control preserves the desired properties of decentralization and transparency, while aiming to keep the costs involved as minimal as possible. We have evaluated DEDACS in the context of a Uniswap token-exchange platform, in which we evaluated the costs related to (i) the introduced overhead at deployment time and (ii) the operational overhead cost. DEDACS introduces a relative overhead of on average 52\% at deployment time, and an operational overhead between 52\% and 80\% depending on the chosen policy and its complexity.},

Through interviews with 24 users, we explore reasons for selecting wallets in different contexts. Participants opt for smart contract wallets to simplify key management, leveraging social interactions. However, they prefer personal devices over individuals as guardians to avoid social cybersecurity concerns in managing guardian relationships. When engaging in high-stakes or complex transactions, they often choose browser-based wallets, leveraging third-party security extensions. For simpler transactions, they prefer the convenience of mobile wallets. Many participants avoid hardware wallets due to usability issues and security concerns with respect to key recovery service provided by manufacturer and phishing attacks. Social networks play a dual role: participants seek security advice from friends, but also express security concerns in soliciting this help. We offer novel insights into how and why users adopt specific wallets. We also discuss design recommendations for future wallet technologies based on our findings.},

We overcome the challenges posed by the informal and ungrammatical nature of tweets to analyze a corpus of 306,835 relevant tweets collected over the four-month period, preceding the November 2015 Ohio Marijuana Legalization ballot and the four months after the election for all states in the US. Our analysis revealed two key insights: (i) the people in states that have legalized recreational marijuana express greater positive sentiments about marijuana than the people in states that have either legalized medicinal marijuana or have not legalized marijuana at all; (ii) the states that have a high percentage of positive sentiment about marijuana is more inclined to authorize (e.g., by allowing medical marijuana) or broaden its legal usage (e.g., by allowing recreational marijuana in addition to medical marijuana). Our analysis shows that social media can provide reliable information and can serve as an alternative to traditional polling of public opinion on drug use and epidemiology research.},

abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are decentralized digital tokens to represent the unique ownership of items. Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

abstract = {Recent advancements of blockchain technologies ensure security and trustability of Community Currency Systems (CCSs), enabling their increasingly widespread adoption. These systems aim at empowering the local economies by virtue of a medium of exchange whose governance and circulation are local. Smart contracts enable the enforcement of token economy policies, which facilitate the experimentation of radically new economic models. Recent studies investigated blockchain-based CCSs. Still, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing a CCS providing a token-based Universal Basic Income (UBI). We evaluate the Circles UBI decentralised application utility in delivering an unconditional income to its users, focusing on its main pilot project running in Berlin. We analyse the structural changes in the network, especially in relation to a subsidy program, involving local businesses. We also identify prominent users based on centrality measures, and investigate how the UBI was effectively spent. We adopt a method agnostic to the economic context to identify optimal aggregation windows for the temporal network of CCS transactions based on the Causal Fidelity (CF) index. This aims to provide static representations as accurate as possible in terms of sequential order of edges, which aspect was not considered in previous research on CCSs. Our findings suggest that the pilot project sustained the expansion of the economic network and the system facilitated trade in urban communities in Berlin. Future research is needed to identify methods to ensure sustainability of self-organised CCSs adopting a UBI issuance scheme and to further decentralise their governance.},

abstract = {The security and usability of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications depend on the secure management of cryptographic keys. However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work we first revisit the problem of threshold ECDSA by considering the commonly admissible 'server-aided' model, namely, the presence of a semi-honest and non-colluding service provider. Then, we leverage that model and consider cases where that 'server' is distributed, introducing the novel concept of unstoppable wallets; hence eliminating any single point of failure. Unstoppable wallets are programmable threshold ECDSA wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We construct highly efficient threshold ECDSA protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security in the server-aided model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority among the signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold ECDSA key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead.We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these protocols, written in a smart contract language, deployed on the Secret Network - a blockchain that plays the role of the server. Using that deployment, we showcase the protocols' applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.},

abstract = {User migration, i.e. the movement of large sets of users from one online social platform to another one, is one of the main phenomena occurring in modern online social networks and even involves the most recent alternative paradigms of online social networks, such as blockchain online social networks (BOSNs). In these platforms, user migration mainly occurs through hard forks of the supporting blockchain, i.e. a split of the original blockchain and the creation of an alternative blockchain, to which users may decide to migrate. However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

However, the transparency of blockchain networks and the open mechanism of DeFi applications also cause new security issues. In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.},

abstract = {In 1971, social critic Ivan Illich published Deschooling Society, a controversial work that critiqued mainstream education systems and proposed a radical alternative. While his work remains controversial, re-examining his ideas might advance efforts to design for learning at scale. First, we examine three design principles that emerge from Illich's writing on learning webs: (1) a holistic perspective that incorporates multidisciplinary thinking (in Illich's case, blending philosophy, politics, sociology, economics, theology, and cybernetics), (2) learning webs as a framework for thinking about learning beyond the limitations of school, and (3) broadening our view of what should be scaled (e.g., scaling opportunities rather than content). Second, we discuss three tensions in Illich's work that relate to scaling learning: (1) decentralization vs. centralization, (2) place-based vs. online learning at scale, and (3) serving the advantaged vs. the disadvantaged. In discussing these ideas and tensions, we discuss contemporary technologies and models, which may be seen as similar to learning webs. Finally, we suggest that Illich's work offers an opportunity to further connect work that sits across two related research communities: Learning @ Scale and connected learning.},

abstract = {Blockchain and smart contracts are one of the key technologies promoting Web 3.0. However, due to security considerations and consistency requirements, smart contracts currently only support simple and deterministic programs, which significantly hinders their deployment in intelligent Web 3.0 applications. To enhance smart contracts intelligence on the blockchain, we propose SMART, a plug-in smart contract framework that supports efficient AI model inference while being compatible with existing blockchains. To handle the high complexity of model inference, we propose an on-chain and off-chain joint execution model, which separates the SMART contract into two parts: the deterministic code still runs inside an on-chain virtual machine, while the complex model inference is offloaded to off-chain compute nodes. To solve the non-determinism brought by model inference, we leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to endorse the integrity and correctness of the off-chain execution. We also design distributed attestation and secret key provisioning schemes to further enhance the system security and model privacy. We implement a SMART prototype and evaluate it on a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchain. Theoretical analysis and prototype evaluation show that SMART not only achieves the security goals of correctness, liveness, and model privacy, but also has approximately 5 orders of magnitude faster inference efficiency than existing on-chain solutions.},

abstract = {IT artifacts and systems increasingly act autonomously and interact non-deterministically, and we have not yet learned how to deal with this empowerment of machine agency in digital government. Following the sociomateriality discourse, this research unfolds a perspective from which digital government research can understand the intertwinement of human action and technology performance while designing and shaping the upcoming digitalization of government operations. This perspective assumes an intended primacy of the people in the citizen−government relationship and perceives the marginalization of humans as a significant threat to applying social values in governance, especially when situated action is required. Using Mintzberg's models of managing government, we identify a variety of ‘monster’ challenges, point to opportunities for decomposition of human and machine agency and advocate the alignment and composition of both agencies as a long-term learning process that involves both citizens and technology and requires safeguarding by multiple stakeholders.},

abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

abstract = {Threshold signatures protect the signing key by sharing it among a group of signers so that an adversary must corrupt a threshold number of signers to be able to forge signatures. Existing threshold signatures with succinct signatures and constant verification times do not work if signers have different weights. Such weighted settings are seeing increasing importance in decentralized systems, especially in the Proof-of-Stake blockchains. This paper presents a new paradigm for threshold signatures for pairing and discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems. Our scheme has a compact verification key consisting of only 7 group elements, and a signature consisting of 8 group elements. Verifying the signature requires 8 exponentiations and 8 bilinear pairings. Our scheme supports arbitrary weight distributions among signers and arbitrary thresholds. It requires non-interactive preprocessing after a universal powers-of-tau setup. We prove the security of our scheme in the Algebraic Group Model and implement it using Golang. Our evaluation shows that our scheme achieves a comparable signature size and verification time to a standard (unweighted) threshold signature. Compared to existing multisignature schemes, our scheme has a much smaller public verification key.},

We propose a comprehensive method to detect and predict potential collisions within the ego-vehicle's safe zone, utilizing a combination of machine learning techniques including DeepHough, YOLOv8, and LSTM. Furthermore, we introduce heuristic rules to handle sudden changes in object behavior and enhance object detection accuracy under challenging conditions like low visibility. Our approach identifies common near-miss accident patterns and achieves a prediction accuracy of 96.01\% with support from hard brake detection. Comparative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of our method against existing benchmarks. Moreover, our lightweight model is designed for deployment on edge clients, ensuring real-time assistance to drivers.

abstract = {Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been leveraged for defining decentralized economies for the (commercial or private) trade of virtual and physical assets, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formalize proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, unlike existing non-consensus solutions, which are prone to be more compute-time and audit-time intensive, we present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive, through a stochastic game analysis, block proposal strategies under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that when a majority of the consensus protocol participants are licensed by the regulator to propose legal transactions, there exists a fair consensus execution policy to maximize the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, human daily life has become deeply bound to the Internet. To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some technical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the revolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings. Finally, we explore several challenges and issues in this promising area.},

abstract = {Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Online Social Media (OSM) are among the most popular web services. Traditional OSM are known to be affected by serious issues including misinformation, fake news, censorship, and privacy violations, to the point that a pressing demand for new paradigms is raised by users all over the world. Among such paradigms, the concepts around the Web 3.0 are fueling a new revolution of online sociality, pushing towards the adoption of innovative and groundbreaking technologies. In particular, the decentralization of social services through the blockchain technology is representing the most valid alternative to current OSM, enabling the development of rewarding strategies for value redistribution, and fake news detection. However, the so-called Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSMs) are far from being mature, with different platforms that continually try to redefine their services in order to attract larger audiences, thus causing blockchain forks and massive user migrations, with the latter dominating the dynamics of the current OSM landscape, too. In this paper, we deal with the evolution of BOSMs from the perspective of user migration across platforms as a consequence of a fork event. We propose a general user migration model applicable to BOSMs to represent the evolution patterns of fork-based migrations, the multi-interaction structural complexity of BOSMs, and their growth characteristics. Within this framework, we also cope with the task of predicting how users will behave in the case of a fork, i.e. they will remain on the original blockchain or they will migrate to the new one. We apply our framework to the case study of the Steem-Hive fork event, and show the importance of considering both social and economic information, regardless of the learning algorithm considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on blockchain fork and its related user migration.},

However, these technologies still have some unanswered issues, mostly related to data lookup and discovery. In this paper, first, we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system that efficiently manages decentralized keyword-based queries executed on data stored in DFS. Through a hypercube logical layout, queries are efficiently routed among the network, where each node is responsible for a specific keywords set and the related contents. Second, we provide a framework for the governance of the above network, based on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implementation. We show how the use of smart contracts enables organizational decision making and rewards for nodes that have actively contributed to the DHT. Finally, we provide experimental validation of an implementation of our proposal, where the execution of the same protocol for different logical nodes of the hypercube allows us to evaluate the efficiency of communication within the network.},

abstract = {Blockchain games introduce unique gameplay and incentive mechanisms by allowing players to be rewarded with in-game assets or tokens through financial activities. However, most blockchain games are not comparable to traditional games in terms of lifespan and player engagement. In this paper, we try to see the big picture in a small way to explore and determine the impact of gameplay and financial factors on player behavior in blockchain games. Taking Aavegotchi as an example, we collect one year of operation data to build player profiles. We perform an in-depth analysis of player behavior from the macroscopic data and apply an unsupervised clustering method to distinguish the attraction of the gameplay and incentives. Our results reveal that the whole game is held up by a small number of players with high-frequent interaction or vast amounts of funds invested. Financial incentives are indispensable for blockchain games for they provide attraction and optional ways for players to engage with the game. However, financial services are tightly linked to the free market. The game will face an irreversible loss of players when the market experiences depression. For blockchain games, well-designed gameplay should be the fundamental basis for the long-lasting retention of players.},

abstract = {Anonymous credentials empower users with strong privacy controls by enabling them to selectively disclose specific attributes from a credential without unveiling other personal details. However, current anonymous credential systems confront two primary challenges: 1) Their designs are not tailored for resource-limited devices due to their dependence on computationally heavy techniques such as generic zero-knowledge or Groth-Sahai proofs at both presentation and verification phases; and 2) They pose complexities in deploying anonymous credentials as-a-service since users must maintain specific key materials and dedicated software. To tackle these challenges, we present SilentProof, a blockchain-backed anonymous authentication protocol, which offloads the responsibility of credential presentation from individual users to the blockchain. By harnessing the combined strengths of zero-knowledge proxy re-identification and blind signatures, SilentProof empowers the blockchain to create zero-knowledge proofs for users, while ensuring clear user consent and eliminating the need for direct access to user-specific attributes. This design broadens the use cases for anonymous credentials, making it ideal for scalable, secure, and privacy-centric authentication, especially for resource-limited clients. Furthermore, SilentProof lays the groundwork for a new era of privacy-preserving identity management as-a-service. We provide rigorous security proofs to validate our approach and have developed a SilentProof prototype, showcasing the protocol's practical efficiency.},

In the blockchain-backed Web3 communities, known for their transparency and security, airdrop serves as a widespread incentive mechanism for allocating capital and power. However, it remains a controversy on how to justify airdrop to incentive and empower the decentralized governance. In this paper, we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role taxonomy methodology through a data-driven study to understand the characteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop. We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters. In conjunction with the results, we discuss from the aspects of interaction, financialization, and system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions for decentralized communities.},

They have a real impact on how systems are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a very powerful technology and can be a potential disrupter and essential enabler. As AI expands into almost every aspect of our lives, people raise serious concerns about AI misbehaving and misuse. To address this concern, international organizations have put forward ethics guidelines for constructing trustworthy AI (TAI), including privacy, transparency, fairness, robustness, accountability, and so on. However, because of the black-box characteristics and complex models of AI systems, it is challenging to translate these guiding principles and aspirations into AI systems. Blockchain, an important decentralized technology, can provide the capabilities of transparency, traceability, immutability, and secure sharing and hence can be used to make AI trustworthy. In this paper, we survey studies on blockchain-based TAI (BTAI) from a software development lifecycle view. We classify the lifecycle of BTAI into four stages: Planning, data collection, model development, and system deployment/use. Particularly, we investigate and summarize the trustworthy issues that blockchain can achieve in the latter three stages, including (1) data transparency, privacy, and accountability; (2) model transparency, privacy, robustness, and fairness; and (3) robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness of system deployment/use. Finally, we present essential open research issues and future work on developing BTAI systems.},

To comprehensively examine blockchain systems, this article presents both a macro-level overview on the most popular blockchain systems, and a micro-level analysis on a general blockchain framework and its crucial components. The macro-level exploration provides a big picture on the endeavors made by blockchain professionals over the years to enhance the blockchain performance while the micro-level investigation details the blockchain building blocks for deep technology comprehension. More specifically, this article introduces a general modular blockchain analytic framework that decomposes a blockchain system into interacting modules and then examines the major modules to cover the essential blockchain components of network, consensus, and distributed ledger at the micro-level. The framework as well as the modular analysis jointly build a foundation for designing scalable, flexible, and application-adaptive blockchains that can meet diverse requirements. Additionally, this article explores popular technologies that can be integrated with blockchain to expand functionality and highlights major challenges. Such a study provides critical insights to overcome the obstacles in designing novel blockchain systems and facilitates the further development of blockchain as a digital infrastructure to service new applications.},

Recognizing that AI reasoning measures cannot be wholly automated, due to factors such as cultural complexity, we conducted an extensive examination of five commercial Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), focusing on their comprehension and interpretation of culturally intricate contexts. Utilizing our novel “Reasoning and Value Alignment Test”, we assessed the GPT models’ ability to reason in complex situations and grasp local cultural subtleties. Our findings have indicated that, although the models have exhibited high levels of human-like reasoning, significant limitations remained, especially concerning the interpretation of cultural contexts. This paper also explored potential applications and use-cases of our Test, underlining its significance in AI training, ethics compliance, sensitivity auditing, and AI-driven cultural consultation. We concluded by emphasizing its broader implications in the AGI domain, highlighting the necessity for interdisciplinary approaches, wider accessibility to various GPT models, and a profound understanding of the interplay between GPT reasoning and cultural sensitivity.},

abstract = {Blockchain Technologies, known as BCT have been praised by most people as a new and revolutionary means of ensuring secure and transparent data sharing and record keeping with potential uses in a number of sectors. The government sector is one of them. The potentials of DLTs are among the motivating reasons why most government agencies are looking to this technology to help make them become more efficient, accountable, cost-effective, and transparent. Some, on the other hand, are looking for ways in which the DLTs can help increase the trust in government agencies as well as various governmental institutions. Despite the endless potentials of the DLTs, they are still in infant stage and at the same time having a number of risks that may deter its future integration and use. This paper proposes a framework towards the integration of DLTs into government organizations of various levels like municipalities and public services that will help in introduction of them in governmental tasks such as digital ID management, secure document handling and voting while keeping them simple for administrators to use and apply in every organization and domain.},

abstract = {Spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) techniques can aid in debugging, but their practicality in industrial settings has been limited due to the large number of tests needed to execute before applying SBFL. Previous research has explored different trigger modes for SBFL and found that applying it immediately after the first test failure is also effective. However, this study only considered single-location bugs, while multi-location bugs are prevalent in real-world scenarios and especially at our company Cvent, which is interested in integrating SBFL to its CI/CD workflow.  

In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of SBFL on multi-location bugs and propose a framework called Instant Fault Localization for Multi-location Bugs (IFLM). We compare and evaluate four trigger modes of IFLM using open-source (Defects4J) and close-source (Cvent) bug datasets.  

Our study showed that it is not necessary to execute all test cases before applying SBFL. However, we also found that that applying SBFL right after the first failed test is less effective than applying it after executing all tests for multi-location bugs, which is contrary to the single-location bug study. We also observe differences in performance between real and artificial bugs. Our contributions include the development of IFLM and CVent bug datasets, analysis of SBFL effectiveness for multi-location bugs, and practical implications for integrating SBFL in industrial environments.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been designed to ensure the correctness and integrity of transaction and process management. A ledger maintains records of data transactions as well as assures the correct execution of processes attached to data. Consistency across processes and parties is achieved by means of consensus building. However, scalability is a major concern when and significant amounts of data need confirmation. When digitalizing existing business processes with serious amounts of data, scalability becomes a pivotal objective. Hence, technical means for information compression become a vital asset. This paper presents a novel approach for data aggregation. On the one hand, data are aggregated in order to merely maintain an audit certificate of the aggregate on the ledger. On the other hand, provenance of raw data aggregated can be traced and proven correctly. Hence, audit services for information exchange in business relationships can scale, while raw data of supplier parties must not be unveiled in detail. We present a novel architecture for efficient data aggregation, while ensuring smart contracts and their main functionality of processing relevant process data. German waterway transportation serves as evaluation scenario. Moreover, decentral identity management is introduced as anchor element of our DLT-enabled ecosystem for business collaboration. Hence, preserving sovereignty and safety of personal data can be assured for M2M economies.},

The framework we built at Netflix standardizes Animation Production Reporting at scale, by employing modern data processing techniques like Apache Spark and incorporating different layers such as parse, transform, and publish. This paper delves into the design of each layer and the abstractions used, making it feasible for animation studios globally to adopt our framework for reporting.

However, since interoperability and scalability, due to high and capped (in particular cases) transaction latency are deep-rooted in the architecture of blockchain technology, they are by default inherited in any blockchain based applications. Lightning Network (LN) is one of the supporting technologies developed to eliminate this impediment of blockchain technology by facilitating instantaneous transfers of cryptos. Since the potentials of LN is still relatively unknown, this paper investigates the current states of development along with possible non-monetary usage of LN, especially in settlement coloured coins such as securities, as well as creation of new business models based on Lightning Applications (LApps) and microchannel payments as well as micro-trades. The legal challenges that may act as impediment to the adoption of LN is also discussed.},

abstract = {The construction industry is a $6 trillion industry worldwide with a prediction to grow towards $10,3 trillion by 2023 and constitutes an essential part of the global economy. Nevertheless, the management of the construction effort is still very manual. The construction process from design, to sourcing of material, contract management, and so on, is a convoluted and intransparent process filled with risks the collaborating parties are exposed to. A need exists for management platforms that streamline and automate collaborative construction processes, establish transparency, traceability, and information symmetry between business parties. This paper presents the Construction Project Management (CoPM) platform that is based on blockchain- and smart-contract technologies for enabling peer-to-peer collaboration between construction parties that enhances the flow of information for reducing cost- and time expenditures while improving the quality of service. The CoPM system is based on diligent up-front requirement studies from which we derive a coherent system architecture and set of cooperation protocols. Thereby, the CoPM system overcomes the currently existing fractured value propositions for construction-management systems.CCS Concepts •Software and its engineering•Software creation and management•Designing software},

abstract = {Widely used Deep Learning (DL) frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet, heavily rely on the NVIDIA cuDNN for performance. However, using cuDNN does not always give the best performance. One reason is that it is hard to handle every case of versatile DNN models and GPU architectures with a library that has a fixed implementation. Another reason is that cuDNN lacks kernel fusion functionality that gives a lot of chances to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a DL optimization framework for versatile GPU workloads, called DeepCuts. It considers both kernel implementation parameters and GPU architectures. It analyzes the DL workload, groups multiple DL operations into a single GPU kernel, and generates optimized GPU kernels considering kernel implementation parameters and GPU architecture parameters. The evaluation result with various DL workloads for inference and training indicates that DeepCuts outperforms cuDNN/cuBLAS-based implementations and the state-of-the-art DL optimization frameworks, such as TVM, TensorFlow XLA, and TensorRT.},

abstract = {Improving driver behaviors through driving education and coaching is well-recognized as being necessary and efficient for driving safely and reducing traffic accidents, as they promise to reduce human factors accounting for most of the crash involvements. Driver education programs are currently widely employed in many countries, ensuring that the necessary procedural driving skills and competencies are imparted during these processes, to make more skilled drivers. However, making people more skilled drivers does not make them safer ones, the effectiveness of driving education is greatly restricted by the limited amount of actual supervised driving involved and the absence of individualized feedback. To this aim, driving coaching emerges as a more practical alternative to develop safely driving by proactively providing coaching feedback to enhance skills and cultivate corrective behaviors, with the recent technological developments in intelligent vehicles and transportation. This paper presents a systematic review of the existing studies for examining the empirical evidences on the various coaching explorations for the development of drivers’ procedural driving skills. In particular, we propose a taxonomy to classify existing driving coaching into four categories, and explore the answers to three questions: what types, when and how the different kinds of driving coaching are provided and delivered. Finally, the challenges and future directions are also presented from three aspects.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enable new forms of business collaboration while the combination with smart contracts allows for an automation of business and collaboration processes. The immutability of DLT secures the execution of business processes. Hence, any process automation or resource management activities are tamper-proof. Yet, a widespread use can only takeoff, if business process experts can directly use this new form of technology, since business process experts are not necessarily programming experts. Thus, we argue for a high-level business process modeling to allow an application-oriented formulation of business collaboration. Hence it is important to research the instantiation and execution of business processes on DLTs, which are formulated in conventional notations.Existing approaches for process implementation on DLTs build-upon state machines that encode the process flow in smart contracts. Thereby every process instantiation requires the creation of a new smart contract with its state machine. In contrast we propose a variant of process implementation that builds-upon an extending kernel. The execution logic is encoded as a core function in the validation routine of DLT nodes. Going down this avenue, the process flow is specified inside transactions and the validation routine will ensure that the process is correctly executed. We validate the implementation of our approach and compare it to alternatives that implement processes by state machines across smart contracts.},

abstract = {Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.},
