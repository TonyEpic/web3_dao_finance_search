abstract = {Blockchain interoperability is emerging as one of the crucial features of blockchain technology, but the knowledge necessary for achieving it is fragmented. This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain’s novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.},

abstract = {The connected car—a vehicle capable of accessing to the Internet, of communicating with smart devices as well as other cars and road infrastructures, and of collecting real-time data from multiple sources—is likely to play a fundamental role in the foreseeable Internet Of Things. In a context ruled by very strong competitive forces, a significant amount of car manufacturers and software and hardware developers have already embraced the challenge of providing innovative solutions for new-generation vehicles. Today’s cars are asked to relieve drivers from the most stressful operations needed for driving, providing them with interesting and updated entertainment functions. In the meantime, they have to comply with the increasingly stringent standards about safety and reliability. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the possibilities offered by connected functionalities on cars and the associated technological issues and problems, as well as to enumerate the currently available hardware and software solutions and their main features.},

abstract = {In a contemporary data center, Linux applications often generate a large quantity of real-time system call traces, which are not suitable for traditional host-based intrusion detection systems deployed on every single host. Training data mining models with system calls on a single host that has static computing and storage capacity is time-consuming, and intermediate datasets are not capable of being efficiently handled. It is cumbersome for the maintenance and updating of host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) installed on every physical or virtual host, and comprehensive system call analysis can hardly be performed to detect complex and distributed attacks among multiple hosts. Considering these limitations of current system-call-based HIDS, in this article, we provide a review of the development of system-call-based HIDS and future research trends. Algorithms and techniques relevant to system-call-based HIDS are investigated, including feature extraction methods and various data mining algorithms. The HIDS dataset issues are discussed, including currently available datasets with system calls and approaches for researchers to generate new datasets. The application of system-call-based HIDS on current embedded systems is studied, and related works are investigated. Finally, future research trends are forecast regarding three aspects, namely, the reduction of the false-positive rate, the improvement of detection efficiency, and the enhancement of collaborative security.},

abstract = {This piece explores algorithmic governance as a strength and a vulnerability in the experience of building participatory communities known as "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations". The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation and built cryptographically secure blockchain-based infrastructure to counter this threat. Now, not just on chain transactions are being tracked but every move of participants in blockchain communities. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if mis-used for social control. This piece analyzes the ways in which decentralization efforts can be a threat to themselves by exploring the question, 'Are "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) the next panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in "autonomous" systems?'. By employing ethnographic methods and case study analysis, this piece provides an important qualitative contribution to the early dynamics of the aspirations and problems of decentralized, autonomous organizations.},

abstract = {The emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represents a paradigm shift in the organizational structure enabled by distributed digital ledger technologies such as blockchain. Exclusively digital web-based entities, DAOs function independently through blockchain-based smart contracts that rely on distributed governance, community coordination, and incentive mechanisms rather than top-down hierarchies. As DAOs continue to foster an environment conducive to a new class of digital participants, they are becoming increasingly prominent in the digital cryptocurrency economy, raising questions regarding their structure, sustainability, and adoption. Being collectively owned and managed by their members, DAOs exhibit characteristics of both non-zero and zero-sum dynamics, thereby posing a challenge to conventional centralized and hierarchical management models. This mixed-methods study examines DAOs within modern information ecosystems through a literature review, blockchain analysis, and comparative organizational analysis. The literature review synthesizes academic discourse on DAOs, highlighting key theories, such as decentralization, digital governance, and distributed decision-making. Blockchain analysis of 10 leading DAOs provides engagement and activity metrics. Comparative analysis considers the DAOs’ advantages and challenges in relation to traditional centralized organizations, focusing on aspects such as governance, efficiency, and adaptability. The findings reveal DAOs' innovative potential and adoption barriers, such as reliance on token incentives and difficulties with coordinated decision-making due to reasons like concentration of voting power and others. Although DAOs possess advantages in terms of decentralization, community alignment, and transparent algorithmic execution, traditional organizations currently maintain superiority in terms of stability and legal standing. This study provides an interdisciplinary academic perspective on the concept and implementation of the DAO by combining conceptual understanding, empirical blockchain evidence, and comparative analysis. It is concluded that realizing the transformative potential of DAOs requires synthesizing multidisciplinary insights and overcoming substantive adoption hurdles. The proposed framework serves as a foundation for further research on the evolution and integration of DAOs into organizations of the future.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has enabled a thriving emergent ecosystem of tools and communities actively using decentralized systems. However, most blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum) requires users to pay some fees to execute their desired actions in these novel online services. To which extent an increase in the price of such fees negatively affects user activity? Would significant price surges deter users from using blockchain-enabled online services? In this work, we study the 2020 surge of transaction fee price in the Ethereum network, and analyze how that affected user activities. Our use cases are the blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from the platforms DAOstack and DAOhaus. Thus, we analyzed 5,580 transactions from 7,825 users grouped in 191 DAO communities, using a VAR model with a daily time series of the average fee value and the DAO operations. Our results show just a minor influence of the fee (gas) price and the activity of DAO users. The insensitivity of the activity to the fee price is an anomaly in a supposedly self-regulated market, and we consider this should be tackled in future implementations.},

However, smart contracts are not yet legally binding nor enforceable; this makes it difficult for businesses to adopt the DAO paradigm. Therefore, this study reviews existing Smart Contract Languages (SCL) and identifies properties that are critical to any future SCL for drafting legally binding contracts. This is achieved by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of white- and grey literature published between 2015 and 2019. Using the SLR methodology, 45 Selected and 28 Supporting Studies detailing 45 state-of-the-art SCLs are selected. Finally, 10 SCL properties that enable legally compliant DAOs are discovered, and specifications for developing SCLs are explored.},

Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

abstract = {Remote voting has become more critical in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. Blockchain technology and its benefits such as decentralization, security, and transparency have given rise to proposals for blockchain-based voting systems. However, the traceability of blockchain transactions violates voter anonymity in existing proposals. Besides, transaction costs also need to be considered. Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89\% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at .},

Recent incidents (e.g., the Mirai botnet) further highlight such security issues.With emerging technologies such as blockchain and software-defined networks (SDNs), new security solutions are possible in the IoT domain. In this paper we will explore future trends in IoT security: (a) the use of blockchains in IoT security, (b) data provenance for sensor information, (c) reliable and secure transport mechanisms using SDNs (d) scalable authentication and remote attestation mechanisms for IoT devices and (e) threat modeling and risk/maturity assessment frameworks for the domain.},

Consequently, a manual orchestration and configuration of network security functions is no more feasible in an environment where cyber attacks can dramatically exploit breaches related to any minimum configuration error. A new frontier is then the introduction of automation in network security configuration, i.e., automatically designing the architecture of security services and the configurations of network security functions, such as firewalls, Virtual Private Networks gateways, and so on. This opportunity has been enabled by modern computer networks technologies, such as virtualization. In view of these considerations, the motivations for the introduction of automation in network security configuration are first introduced, along with the key automation enablers. Then, the current state of the art in this context is surveyed, focusing on both the achieved improvements and the current limitations. Finally, possible future trends in the field are illustrated.},

abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are an emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm, which caters to large-scale and long-term sensory data collection demand. Among the commercialized LPWAN technologies, LoRa (Long Range) attracts much interest from academia and industry due to its open-source physical (PHY) layer and standardized networking stack. In the flourishing LoRa community, many observations and countermeasures have been proposed to understand and improve the performance of LoRa networking in practice. From the perspective of the LoRa networking stack; however, we lack a whole picture to comprehensively understand what has been done or not and reveal what the future trends are.This survey proposes a taxonomy of a two-dimensional (i.e., networking layers, performance metrics) to categorize and compare the cutting-edge LoRa networking techniques. One dimension is the layered structure of the LoRa networking stack. From down to the top, we have the PHY layer, Link layer, Media-access Control (MAC) layer, and Application (App) layer. In each layer, we focus on the three most representative layer-specific research issues for fine-grained categorizing. The other dimension is LoRa networking performance metrics, including range, throughput, energy, and security. We compare different techniques in terms of these metrics and further overview the open issues and challenges, followed by our observed future trends. According to our proposed taxonomy, we aim at clarifying several ways to achieve a more effective LoRa networking stack and find more LoRa applicable scenarios, leading to a brand-new step toward a large-scale and long-term IoT.},

abstract = {Self-organizing multi-agent systems provide a suitable paradigm for developing autonomic computing systems that manage themselves. Towards this goal, we demonstrate a robust, decentralized approach for structural adaptation in explicitly modeled problem solving agent organizations. Based on self-organization principles, our method enables the autonomous agents to modify their structural relations to achieve a better allocation of tasks in a simulated task-solving environment. Specifically, the agents reason about when and how to adapt using only their history of interactions as guidance. We empirically show that, in a wide range of closed, open, static, and dynamic scenarios, the performance of organizations using our method is close (70–90\%) to that of an idealized centralized allocation method and is considerably better (10–60\%) than the current state-of-the-art decentralized approaches.},

abstract = {We study the ability of autonomous vehicles to improve the throughput of a bottleneck using a fully decentralized control scheme in a mixed autonomy setting. We consider the problem of improving the throughput of a scaled model of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge: a two-stage bottleneck where four lanes reduce to two and then reduce to one. Although there is extensive work examining variants of bottleneck control in a centralized setting, there is less study of the challenging multi-agent setting where the large number of interacting AVs leads to significant optimization difficulties for reinforcement learning methods. We apply multi-agent reinforcement algorithms to this problem and demonstrate that significant improvements in bottleneck throughput, from 20\% at a 5\% penetration rate to 33\% at a 40\% penetration rate, can be achieved. We compare our results to a hand-designed feedback controller and demonstrate that our results sharply outperform the feedback controller despite extensive tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RL-based controllers adopt a robust strategy that works across penetration rates whereas the feedback controllers degrade immediately upon penetration rate variation. We investigate the feasibility of both action and observation decentralization and demonstrate that effective strategies are possible using purely local sensing. Finally, we open-source our code at .},

abstract = {In a shift from the current research trend which is mostly geared towards centralizing access control of autonomous vehicles at intersection of the near future, the authors extend their previously presented intersection management model, which is fully decentralized. Even though it is the most efficient, central control requires fully automated connected vehicles, active vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, which introduces inherent security, privacy and feasibility issues. We simulate autonomous intelligent vehicles making local access decisions at isolated intersections, with only sensing and/or beacon information. The simulation proves to be collision-free. The extended management model is now able to account for various vehicle classes, all possible turns at the intersection and safe turning speeds. Compared to a standard signal controller, the proposed and improved model is again proven to be operationally more efficient.},

abstract = {Owing to the advancements in communication and computation technologies, the dream of commercialized connected and autonomous cars is becoming a reality. However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication. To date, a plethora of research work has already been done covering different aspects of carpooling services (ranging from applications to communication and technologies); however, there is still a lack of a holistic, comprehensive survey that can be a one-stop-shop for the researchers in this area to (i) find all the relevant information and (ii) identify the future research directions. To fill these research challenges, this article provides a comprehensive survey on carpooling in autonomous and connected vehicles and covers architecture, components, and solutions, including scheduling, matching, mobility, pricing models of carpooling. We also discuss the current challenges in carpooling and identify future research directions. This survey is aimed to spur further discussion among the research community for the effective realization of carpooling.},

abstract = {UAVs have found their applications in numerous applications from recreational activities to business in addition to military and strategic fields. However, research on UAVs is not going on as quickly as the technology. Especially, when it comes to the security of these devices, the academia is lagging behind the industry. This gap motivates our work in this article as a stepping stone for future research in this area. A comprehensive survey on the security of UAVs and UAV-based systems can help the research community keep pace with, or even lead the industry. Although there are several reviews on UAVs or related areas, there is no recent survey broadly covering various aspects of security. Moreover, none of the existing surveys highlights current and future trends with a focus on the role of an omnipresent technology such as AI. This article endeavors to overcome these shortcomings. We conduct a comprehensive review on security challenges of UAVs as well as the related security controls. Then we develop a future roadmap for research in this area with a focus on the role of AI. The future roadmap is established based on the identified current trends, under-researched topics, and a future look-ahead.},

This survey focuses particularly on studies that adopt high-performance computing techniques to design, implement, and experiment trajectory-based metaheuristics, which pose a great challenge to high-performance computing and represent a large gap in the operations research literature. We outline the contributions from 1987 to the present, and the result is a complete overview of the current state-of-the-art with respect to multi-core and distributed trajectory-based metaheuristics. Basic notions of high-performance computing are introduced, and different taxonomies for multi-core and distributed architectures and metaheuristics are reviewed. A comprehensive list of 127 publications is summarized and classified according to taxonomies and application types.

abstract = {Modern society is increasingly moving toward complex and distributed computing systems. The increase in scale and complexity of these systems challenges O&amp;M teams that perform daily monitoring and repair operations, in contrast with the increasing demand for reliability and scalability of modern applications. For this reason, the study of automated and intelligent monitoring systems has recently sparked much interest across applied IT industry and academia. Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has been proposed to tackle modern IT administration challenges thanks to Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data. However, AIOps as a research topic is still largely unstructured and unexplored, due to missing conventions in categorizing contributions for their data requirements, target goals, and components. In this work, we focus on AIOps for Failure Management (FM), characterizing and describing 5 different categories and 14 subcategories of contributions, based on their time intervention window and the target problem being solved. We review 100 FM solutions, focusing on applicability requirements and the quantitative results achieved, to facilitate an effective application of AIOps solutions. Finally, we discuss current development problems in the areas covered by AIOps and delineate possible future trends for AI-based failure management.},

To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some technical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the revolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings.

abstract = {Today, cloud computation offloading may not be an appropriate solution for delay-sensitive applications due to the long distance between end-devices and remote datacenters. In addition, offloading to a remote cloud can consume bandwidth and dramatically increase costs. However, end-devices such as sensors, cameras, and smartphones have limited computing and storage capacity. Processing tasks on such battery-powered and energy-constrained devices becomes even more complex. To address these challenges, a new paradigm called Edge Computing (EC) emerged nearly a decade ago to bring computing resources closer to end-devices. Here, edge servers located between the end-device and the remote cloud perform user tasks. Recently, several new computing paradigms such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Fog Computing (FC) have emerged to complement Cloud Computing (CC) and EC. Although these paradigms are heterogeneous, they can further reduce energy consumption and task response time, especially for delay-sensitive applications. Computation offloading is a multi-objective, NP-hard optimization problem. A significant part of previous research in this field is devoted to Machine Learning (ML) methods. One of the essential types of ML is Reinforcement Learning (RL), in which an agent learns how to make the best decision using the experiences gained from the environment. This article provides a systematic review of the widely used RL approaches in computation offloading. It covers research in complementary paradigms such as mobile cloud computing, edge computing, fog computing, and the Internet of Things. We explain the reasons for using various RL methods in computation offloading from a technical point of view. This analysis includes both binary offloading and partial offloading techniques. For each method, the essential elements of RL and the characteristics of the environment are discussed regarding the most important criteria. Research challenges and Future trends are also mentioned.},

abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) or blockchains have been steadily emerging and providing innovation in the past decade for several use cases, ranging from financial networks, to notarization, or trustworthy execution via smart contracts. DLTs are enticing due to their properties of decentralization, non-repudiation, and auditability (transparency). These properties are of high potential to access control systems that can be implemented on-chain, and are executed without infringement and full transparency.While it remains uncertain which use cases will truly turn out to be viable, many use cases such as financial transactions can benefit from integrating certain restrictions via access control on the blockchain. In addition, smart contracts may in the future present security risks that are currently yet unknown. As a solution, access control policies can provide flexibility in the execution flow when adopted by smart contracts.In this paper, we present our DEDACS architecture which provides decentralized and dynamic access control for smart contracts in a policy-based manner. Our access control is expressive as it features policies, and dynamic as the environment or users can be changed, or alternative policies can be assigned to smart contracts. DEDACS ensures that our access control preserves the desired properties of decentralization and transparency, while aiming to keep the costs involved as minimal as possible. We have evaluated DEDACS in the context of a Uniswap token-exchange platform, in which we evaluated the costs related to (i) the introduced overhead at deployment time and (ii) the operational overhead cost. DEDACS introduces a relative overhead of on average 52\% at deployment time, and an operational overhead between 52\% and 80\% depending on the chosen policy and its complexity.},

abstract = {The field of research, which address distributed enterprises interoperability implementation with HLA (High Level Architecture), was initiated in the final report on future trends of INTEROP Network of Excellence [1]. This report presents fields of investigation to support large federation oriented enterprise interoperability and state the requirement of interoperability transition from concepts to implementation.In this paper, we present, in a first point, the enterprise modeling and the enterprise interoperability concepts. A unifying three dimensional framework has been proposed in [2] for enterprise interoperability to represent the ability of interactions between enterprise systems. In this approach, the interoperability is considered as significant if the interactions can take place at least at the three different levels of conceptual abstraction and if interoperability barriers can be bridged. Then, an interoperability approach can be proposed considering the degree of integration between the different enterprises.After that, we give a review of ongoing researches using HLA to support enterprise interoperability execution. Indeed, the HLA standard, initially designed for military M&amp;S purpose, can be transposed for enterprise interoperability at the implementation level, reusing the years of experiences in distributed systems.Then, we conclude the state of the art part by presenting MDA (Model Driven Architecture) methodology that assists the transformation of enterprise models from conceptual level to models for execution or simulation and the emerging MDI (Model Driven Interoperability) methodology for considering the interoperability transformation.We have recalled complementary levels of abstraction to describe enterprise models and a methodology to transform them, but there is no completed methodology for distributed Enterprise modeling, addressing interoperability consideration at each level. From that postulate, we propose to rationalize the development lifecycle of distributed enterprise models by merging the HLA FEDEP and the MDA/MDI methodology to a new unified lifecycle that will guide the development of distributed enterprises models from the conceptual level to the implementation of a solution.We finish by illustrating interoperability problem on the complex problem of aerospace international cooperation.},

abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, DeFi, in fact, has to be regulated so as to achieve its main decentralization goal. In addition, DeFi presents a potential possibility for developing a fairly new regulation method: the idea of “integrated regulation”. The paper considers various approaches to regulation, which can be integrated in the DeFi design. It can potentially lead to the decentralization of both finance and its regulation, which eventually expresses RegTech (Regulatory Technology), which is used by financial organizations for being able to meet the requirements of the regulator more easily. The study defines the problems that are encountered in the course of using DeFi and points out the possible ways for dealing with them, including a way for switching to blockchain independently so that the transaction is not charged in ETH for calculation on blockchain; reducing the complexity and costs of use and understanding of DeFi software by most users. A whole lot of risks that decentralized financial protocols are susceptible to is analyzed: vulnerabilities in the code security of smart contracts, their stacking and layout; oracle risk, which is subject to manipulation in the process of data transfer; the financial risk of high volatility, regulatory risk and crisis of the global economy due to the inability to predict in which way the Covid-19 pandemic is going to be resolved.},

abstract = {In the context of large distributed modular robots, self-reconfiguration is the process of having modules, seen as autonomous agents, acting together and moving to transform the morphology of their physical arrangement to produce a desired shape. However, due to motion constraints, the number of modules that can move concurrently is greatly limited, thus making self-reconfiguration a very slow process. In this paper, we propose an approach for accelerating self-reconfiguration to build a porous version of the desired shape, using scaffolding. We expand this idea and propose a method for constructing a parametric scaffolding model that increases the parallelism of the reconfiguration, supports its mechanical stability, and simplifies planning and coordination between agents. Each agent has a set of basic rules using only four states which guarantees that module movements and the construction of the scaffold are deterministic.  Coupled with an underneath reserve of modules that allows the introduction of rotating quasi-spherical modules at various ground locations of the growing porous structure, our method is able to build the scaffolding structure in $O(N^frac2 3 )$ time with N the number of modules composing the structure. Furthermore, we provide simulation results showing that our method uses $O(N^frac4 3 )$ messages with no congestion.},

abstract = {Local government organisations are the first contact between the citizen and state authorities. However, the rapid technological development in the private sector raises questions on how public actors can keep up. Seeking improvement, local governments undergo the process of digital transformation (DT). This encompasses a variety of processes and initiatives, including experimenting with new technological solutions. We focus here on experiments on one of these emerging technologies: blockchain. We report the results of a multi-case study investigating the DT processes that experiment with blockchain technology in three municipalities in Western Europe. We present our theoretical perspective (institutional logics and digital transformation), describe our qualitative comparative case methodology that relies on key-respondent interviews, and discuss our distilled categorisation of three activities (including excerpts from data).},

Agents require a means to find each other and communicate without reliance on a centralized party and participation in the system must be permissionless. We present the Agent Communication Network (ACN), a peer-to-peer lookup system that provides a distributed overlay to the Internet and addresses this problem. The ACN enables agents to find each other and to communicate safely. It achieves this by leveraging a distributed hash table for agent lookup, maintained by participating peers and through the use of public-key cryptography. The paper discusses the properties of the system and its guarantees as well as its integration with a novel multi-agent system. Preliminary benchmark results demonstrate the feasibility of the system, its performance, and its scalability.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a decentralized agent based implementation of an off-line optimization technique applied to the configuration of electrical microgrids with distributed generation. This implementation conforms the ''Agent Based Energy Management System'' (ABEMS). Software agent principles are used to decentralize the microgrid control without having an implicit or explicit control hierarchy. Unlike most approaches, they work as peers. Orders to be sent to the energy micro-generation units are produced off-line by an evolutionary computation method. The orders are encoded into the agents once the micro-grid is started and agents decide when to apply them. The paper includes experiments that show the resulting behavior in several scenarios executed in real time. Results indicate the technique is stable enough and outperforms more simple approaches, a necessary initial step prior to a more comprehensive comparison with other solutions.},

Decentralised initiatives have emerged to address these issues, beginning with decentralised file systems. These systems have gained popularity, with major platforms serving millions of content requests daily. Complementing the file systems are decentralised search engines and name-registry infrastructures, together forming the basis of a decentralised web. This survey article analyses research trends and emerging technologies for content retrieval on the decentralised web, encompassing both academic literature and industrial projects.Several challenges hinder the realisation of a fully decentralised web. Achieving comparable performance to centralised systems without compromising decentralisation is a key challenge. Hybrid infrastructures, blending centralised components with verifiability mechanisms, show promise to improve decentralised initiatives. While decentralised file systems have seen more mature deployments, they still face challenges such as usability, performance, privacy, and content moderation. Integrating these systems with decentralised name-registries offers a potential for improved usability with human-readable and persistent names for content. Further research is needed to address security concerns in decentralised name-registries and enhance governance and crypto-economic incentive mechanisms.},

There is active research on OMOkC, particularly in the design of decentralised algorithms for solving it. We propose a new take on the issue: Rather than classically developing new algorithms, we apply a macro-level paradigm, called aggregate computing, specifically designed to directly program the global behaviour of a whole ensemble of devices at once. To understand the potential of the application of aggregate computing to OMOkC, we extend the Alchemist simulator (supporting aggregate computing natively) with a novel toolchain component supporting the simulation of mobile robots. This way, we build a software engineering toolchain comprising language and simulation tooling for addressing OMOkC. Finally, we exercise our approach and related toolchain by introducing new algorithms for OMOkC; we show that they can be expressed concisely, reuse existing software components and perform better than the current state-of-the-art in terms of coverage over time and number of objects covered overall.},

abstract = {The centenaries of former chapters of the British Music Society (BMS), established in 1918, have prompted their governing bodies to take stock of their histories and build on the cataloguing, documentation and preservation of their archival collections. The InterMusE project aims to support this shared instinct to archive by capturing and, crucially, linking different forms of data regarding the musical events provided by three of these local concert-giving organisations, beginning with the digitisation of their collections and with a view to producing a dynamic, open-access digital archive. This paper outlines our approach to establishing a foundation for developing a new kind of digital archive for musicology that is both valuable for researchers, fulfils the needs of the societies and their communities, and sheds light on community music-making on a national and, ultimately, international scale. By carrying out a series of preliminary scoping exercises, including informal interviews and archival-collection assessments, we can compare current archiving and preservation activities across the societies. These conversations bring emerging themes, issues and challenges into focus, raising pertinent questions that will inform our development of transformative tools and techniques for community digitisation projects.},

Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

The increasing number of vehicles has made the vehicular network diverse, dynamic, and large-scale, making it difficult to meet the 5G network’s demanding requirements. Decentralized systems are interesting and provide attractive services because they are publicly available (transparency), have an append-only ledger (robust integrity protection), remove single points of failure, and enable distributed key management and communication in a peer-to-peer network. Researchers dedicated substantial efforts to advancing vehicle communications, however conventional cryptographic mechanisms are insufficient which enabled us to look at decentralized technologies. Therefore, we revisit decentralized approaches with VANETs. Endpoint devices hold a wallet which may incorporate threshold key management methods like MPC wallets, HD Wallets, or multi-party threshold ECDSA/EdDSA/BLS. We also discuss trust management approaches and demonstrate how decentralization can improve integrity, security, privacy, and resilience to single points of failure. We also conduct a comprehensive review, comparing them with current requirements, and the latest authentication and secure communication architectures, which require the involvement of trusted but non-transparent authorities in certificate issuance/revocation. We highlight the limitations of these schemes from PKI deployment and recommend future research, particularly in the realm of quantum cryptography.},

abstract = {Highly reliable organizations (HROs) are those organizations, which by nature or design, cannot or must not fail; the consequences of failure in such systems are usually catastrophic. Systems that combine the characteristics of highly reliable operations and distributed, virtual organizations are known as highly reliable virtual organizations (HRVOs)—distributed and electronically linked groups of organizations that excel in high-consequence settings. Tsunami warning systems (TWS) are one example of virtual organizations that operate under enormous expectations for reliability. Adaptive structuration theory suggests that, in complex systems, technology and organizational structures co-evolve, and users adapt technology to their needs, creating shared meaning about the role and utility of technology in various settings. In this article, we consider how the shared meaning that develops in the social shaping of technology in one HRVO, tsunami warning systems, contributes to reliability enhancement. Following Poole and DeSanctis [2000], this study is a structuration study in a particular context, exploring how structuration occurs, the conditions that influence it, and its consequences or outcomes. We begin by describing HRVOs and the co-adaptive roles that technology and organizational structures play in such organizations. We then describe a global tsunami warning system as an illustrative case of a globally distributed sociotechnical system for which use of technology and distributed organizational structures should enhance reliability. We describe how social media plays a role in adaptive structuration in tsunami warning systems, and then return to consider the nature of HRVOs and their characteristics, en route to identifying challenges in the co-adaptation of technology and organizational structures in highly reliable tsunami warning systems.},

abstract = {In today’s world, critical infrastructure is often controlled by computing systems. This introduces new risks for cyber attacks, which can compromise the security and disrupt the functionality of these systems. It is therefore necessary to build such systems with strong guarantees of resiliency against cyber attacks. One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal verification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber security properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber security and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM into the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking, and lightweight FM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of terms. We further develop categories based on the type of computing system FM are applied in. Solutions in each class and category are presented, discussed, compared, and summarised. We describe historical highlights and developments and present a state-of-the-art review in the area of FM in cyber security. This review is presented from the point of view of FM practitioners and researchers, commenting on the trends in each of the classes and categories. This is achieved by considering all types of FM, several types of security and safety-critical systems, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article hence provides a comprehensive overview of FM and techniques available to system designers of security-critical systems, simplifying the process of choosing the right tool for the task. The article concludes by summarising the discussion of the review, focusing on best practices, challenges, general future trends, and directions of research within this field.},

Literature in this significant domain is insufficient, and there are many research gaps which demand attention. This paper is a benefit for those who want to understand or contribute to this domain for research point of view or development. This article presents a general overview of blockchain technology its significant components, existing applications and some limitations of this technology.},

abstract = {Policies are a powerful means of expressing high-level, goal oriented parameters to manage the behavior of systems and users, and are thus valuable tools for autonomic management. However, the autonomic management of policies is in itself a challenging problem. Particularly, their applicability is typically limited in situations where management actions depend on dynamic system properties, which require adapting policy application thresholds and parameters without modifying absolute policy definition constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel policy definition framework that enables autonomic policy adaptation and proactive policy application, based on the online analysis and characterization of system operation and feedback events. Our approach is supported by a decentralized clustering mechanism and scalable distributed communication platform that together enable the online analysis of events and the efficient generation and enforcement of dynamic policies among distributed system components. We justify, with the evaluation of illustrative scenarios, the need for online data analysis for policy adaptation and the potential benefits of our approach.},
