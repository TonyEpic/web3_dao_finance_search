abstract = {Mobile devices and platforms have become an established target for modern software developers due to performant hardware and a large and growing user base numbering in the billions. Despite their popularity, the software development process for mobile apps comes with a set of unique, domain-specific challenges rooted in program comprehension. Many of these challenges stem from developer difficulties in reasoning about different representations of a program, a phenomenon we define as a "language dichotomy". In this paper, we reflect upon the various language dichotomies that contribute to open problems in program comprehension and development for mobile apps. Furthermore, to help guide the research community towards effective solutions for these problems, we provide a roadmap of directions for future work.},

Currently, Blockchain operates like information isolated island, they cannot obtain external data or execute transactions on their own.Motivated by recent studies [1-3] on blockchain's multiChain framework, we investigate the cross-chain communication. We introduces blockchain router, which empowers blockchains to connect and communicate cross chains. By establishing an economic model, blockchain router enables different blockchains in the network communicate with each other same like Internet network. In the network of blockchain router, some blockchain plays the role of a router which, according to the communication protocol, analyzes and transmits communication requests, dynamically maintaining a topology structure of the blockchain network.},

abstract = {Today, digital platforms are increasingly mediating our day-to-day work and crowdsourced forms of labour are progressively gaining importance (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk, Universal Human Relevance System, TaskRabbit). In many popular cases of crowdsourcing, a volatile, diverse, and globally distributed crowd of workers compete among themselves to find their next paid task. The logic behind the allocation of these tasks typically operates on a “First-Come, First-Served” basis. This logic generates a competitive dynamic in which workers are constantly forced to check for new tasks. This article draws on findings from ongoing collaborative research in which we co-design, with crowdsourcing workers, three alternative models of task allocation beyond “First-Come, First-Served”, namely (1) round-robin, (2) reputation-based, and (3) content-based. We argue that these models could create fairer and more collaborative forms of crowd labour. We draw on Amara On Demand, a remuneration-based crowdsourcing platform for video subtitling and translation, as the case study for this research. Using a multi-modal qualitative approach that combines data from 10 months of participant observation, 25 semi-structured interviews, two focus groups, and documentary analysis, we observed and co-designed alternative forms of task allocation in Amara on Demand. The identified models help envision alternatives towards more worker-centric crowdsourcing platforms, understanding that platforms depend on their workers, and thus ultimately they should hold power within them.},

Therefore, this ongoing study attempts to analyze current NER models’ performance and limitations on the CORD-19 dataset. By examining three NER models, this study showed that NER performance is improved with the similarity between the testing and pretraining data. When there are little manually annotated resources for COVID-19 NER exist, our analysis suggested that for training purposes, enhancing the dictionary for seed annotation is effective (not necessarily requiring costly human annotation).},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack is one of the most common and costly destructive attacks on the target system. This attack has become a challenge for companies, governments, and organizations’ information security systems. In recent years, methods for detecting and preventing APT attacks that use machine learning or deep learning algorithms to analyze indications and anomalous behaviors in network traffic have become popular. However, due to a lack of typical data from attack campaigns, the APT attack detection approach that uses behavior analysis and evaluation approaches encounter many issues. Network traffic analysis to detect a common APT attack is one of the solutions for dealing with this situation. This paper develops efficient and flexible deep learning models. To analyze huge network traffic, a hybrid deep learning approach that builds two models is used: Stacked Autoencoder with Long Short-Term Memory (SAE-LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM) to detect indications of APT attacks. A reliable dataset ’DAPT2020’ that covers all APT stages is used to evaluate the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid deep learning approach proved to give higher performance than the individual deep learning model in detecting malicious behavior in each APT stage.},

abstract = {Information disorder is one of the most typical challenges in the current era of science and technology. The amount of information on the internet is increasing, but its correctness and authenticity are not always guaranteed, leading to false information, fake news, etc. The mentioned problem negatively affects users' reception and use of information. Unlike deepfake, cheapfake is created using simple techniques and does not rely on AI to produce fake multimedia. Cheapfake is becoming increasingly popular due to its ease of creation. Thus, there is a growing need to develop techniques that can detect cheapfake content. Following previous events, the Grand Challenge on Detecting Cheapfakes at ACM ICMR 2024 continues to seek contributions from researchers on cheapfake detection with the goal of improving effectiveness and creativity in approach, and understanding the limitations of the current dataset. This challenge has accepted 6 new proposed methods from participants with the highest private test accuracies achieved at 72.2\% for Task 1 and 54.84\% for Task 2. The highest public test accuracies for the two tasks are 95.6\% and 93\% respectively. These new methods focus on incorporating new AI models such as Stable Diffusion, LLM. These new findings represent the latest advancements in cheapfake detection research and introduce new potential approaches for future research.},

We proposed a multi-channel sensor network construction method involving hardware, acquisition, and synchronization in the smart home environment and a smart home data fusion method (SHDFM) for multi-modal data (position, gait, voice, pose, facial expression, temperature, and humidity) generated in the smart home environment to address the configuration of a multi-channel sensor network, improve the quality and efficiency of various human activities and environmental data collection, and reduce the difficulty of multi-modal data fusion in the smart home. SHDFM contains 5 levels, with inputs and outputs as criteria to provide recommendations for multi-modal data fusion strategies in the smart home. We built a real experimental environment using the proposed method in this paper. To validate our method, we created a real experimental environment — a physical setup in a home-like scenario where the multi-channel sensor network and data fusion techniques were deployed and evaluated. The acceptance and testing results show that the proposed construction and data fusion methods can be applied to the examples with high robustness, replicability, and scalability. Besides, we discuss how smart homes with multi-channel sensor networks can support digital twins.},

abstract = {The Metaverse, envisioned as the next-generation Internet, will be constructed via twining a practical world in a virtual form, wherein Meterverse service providers (MSPs) are required to collect massive data from Meterverse users (MUs). In this regard, a critical demand exists for MSPs to motivate MUs to contribute computing resources and data while preserving user privacy. Federated learning (FL), as a privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning paradigm, can support distributed intensive computation in the Metaverse. In this work, we first investigate minting the machine learning models into NFT with FL assistance (referred to as FL-NFT), such that MUs as stakeholders can control the ownership and share the economic value of user-generated content (UGC). Specifically, MUs are encouraged to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (i.e., MU-DAO) to aggregate local models and mint FL-NFT. MUs and MSPs optimize the strategies by formulating an imperfect information Stackelberg game to trade off the cost and benefit. We apply the backward induction to derive the equilibrium solution. Then, we construct a privacy-preserving multi-winner sealed-bid auction mechanism (PMS-AM), in which the Hidden Markov Model assists MSPs in choosing rational bidding strategies according to historical bids, and the double auction mechanism determines the winners and price of FL-NFT. Finally, the numerical results based on theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed PMS-AM can increase the quality of FL-NFT and achieve the economic properties of incentive mechanisms such as individual rationality and incentive compatibility.},

abstract = {Ethereum is a blockchain platform that enables the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts will execute a set of instructions without an intermediary party when called upon. The possibility to make calls to another contract or exchange cryptocurrency allows for potential exploits to occur, most notable reentrancy. The Solidity language for coding smart contracts has syntactic constructs created to be safer alternatives, and guards to aid in securing code against exploits. In this paper, we collect a total of 26,799 verified Solidity smart contracts from Etherscan, to analyze the language constructs used in calling another contract or exchanging ether. We also analyze the usage of guards to make the code more secure. For instance, even though call is the unsafest function, it is still used by 50\% of the contracts in our dataset. The safe method transfer is used by approximately one-third of contracts, and send is rarely used. We noticed that contracts using call have a higher average and median size in Lines of Code than normal. We also found an increased percentage of call contracts using more guards. Moreover, 97\% of all contracts are using the require guard, with 23 uses of require on average per contract. This may be an indication that Solidity developers are using more guards to prevent exploits in their contracts},

Drawing on the paradigm of Institutional Analysis and Development, this paper proposes a strategy for addressing this lapse by specifying basic features of a generalizable paradigm for online governance called Modular Politics. Whereas classical governance typologies tend to present a choice among wholesale ideologies, such as democracy or oligarchy, Modular Politics would enable platform operators and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from computational components that are modular and composable, highly versatile in their expressiveness, portable from one context to another, and interoperable across platforms. This kind of approach could implement pre-digital governance systems as well as accelerate innovation in uniquely digital techniques. As diverse communities share and connect their components and data, governance could occur through a ubiquitous network layer. To that end, this paper proposes the development of an open standard for networked governance.},

However, building an optimal DCNN and ameliorating FR performance are still the main challenges for researchers. Thus, we first investigate and analyzes the effect of several novel effective loss functions based on softmax on DCNN with the ResNet architecture. We then propose an ensemble learning, namely EnsFace, by taking advantage of recent novel FR methods based on CosFace, ArcFace, and MagFace. EnsFace elaborates on the voting mechanism that utilizes non-optimal pre-trained models to obtain better discriminative ability for FR. To prove the performance of both the speed and accuracy of EnsFace, we carry out rigorous experiments using several popular benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP, and AgeDB-30, as well as two renovations of LFW: CALFW and CPLFW. The results of our experiments achieve state-of-the-art figures, which show the proposed method’s massive potential to improve FR performance. Ablation studies and overall benchmarks undeniably prove the effectiveness of our EnsFace.},

Given a smart contract P and a type-level transformation, our method automatically synthesizes a new contract P′ that is functionally equivalent to P. Our approach provides a convenient DSL for expressing data type refactorings and employs program synthesis to generate the new version of the contract. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Solidare and demonstrate its capabilities on real-world smart contracts from Etherscan and GasStation. In particular, we show that our approach is effective at automating the desired data layout transformation and that it is useful for reducing gas usage of smart contracts that use rich data structures.},

abstract = {In recent years, cryptocurrencies have increasingly gained interest. The underlying technology, Blockchain, shifts the responsibility for securing assets to the end-user and requires them to manage their (private) keys. Little attention has been given to how cryptocurrency users handle the challenges of key management in practice and how they select the tools to do so. To close this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=10). Our thematic analysis revealed prominent themes surrounding motivation, risk assessment, and coin management tool usage in practice. We found that the choice of tools is driven by how users assess and balance the key risks that can lead to loss: the risk of (1) human error, (2) betrayal, and (3) malicious attacks. We derive a model, explaining how risk assessment and intended usage drive the decision which tools to use. Our work is complemented by discussing design implications for building systems for the crypto economy.},

abstract = {Ethereum is a major blockchain-based platform for smart contracts - Turing complete programs that are executed in a decentralized network and usually manipulate digital units of value. Solidity is the most mature high-level smart contract language. Ethereum is a hostile execution environment, where anonymous attackers exploit bugs for immediate financial gain. Developers have a very limited ability to patch deployed contracts. Hackers steal up to tens of millions of dollars from flawed contracts, a well-known example being "The DAO", broken in June 2016. Advice on secure Ethereum programming practices is spread out across blogs, papers, and tutorials. Many sources are outdated due to a rapid pace of development in this field. Automated vulnerability detection tools, which help detect potentially problematic language constructs, are still underdeveloped in this area.We provide a comprehensive classification of code issues in Solidity and implement SmartCheck - an extensible static analysis tool that detects them1. SmartCheck translates Solidity source code into an XML-based intermediate representation and checks it against XPath patterns. We evaluated our tool on a big dataset of real-world contracts and compared the results with manual audit on three contracts. Our tool reflects the current state of knowledge on Solidity vulnerabilities and shows significant improvements over alternatives. SmartCheck has its limitations, as detection of some bugs requires more sophisticated techniques such as taint analysis or even manual audit. We believe though that a static analyzer should be an essential part of contract developers' toolbox, letting them fix simple bugs fast and allocate more effort to complex issues.},

abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis is a common infectious disease primarily targeting the lungs and of high morality and prevalence. Efficient prediction of tuberculosis is important to counter epidemics and successfully allocate recourse. This study's main objective is to investigate the effectiveness of using web search queries in predicting the incidence of tuberculosis in China. We conduct a comprehensive comparison on data driven methods for predicting the incidence of tuberculosis.Methods: Several data mining models are implemented in our study, including stepwise linear regression and SVM incorporating Baidu index (a recording of search queries on Baidu, the main search engine in China). The two methods are compared with traditional time series methods of autoregressive integrated moving (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA). In addition, to further investigate the reliability of prediction, the effectiveness of integrating the individual models is explored in our study, a hybrid model of SARIMA and SVM and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) are adopted to maximize the predictive utility of the models.Results and Conclusion: The experiment results show that Internet queries provide effective data sources for predicting tuberculosis, with comparable predicting ability to that of traditional time series models. It also shows that combining two or models using BMA or hybrid models can improve the prediction ability, with BMA showing by far the best results in prediction in terms of both MAPE and RSME in the 5 areas studied (Guangdong, Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai). The findings from this study pave the way for developing accurate and timely prediction of tuberculosis cases, which is important for allocating healthcare recourses and developing strategies to counter possible future outbreaks in real practice.},

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has spread and seriously affected the whole world since its first appearance in 2019. In early 2021, after two successful anti-epidemic attempts, Covid-19 broke out again with the relatively big number of Coronavirus infected cases in the community in Vietnam. When the government decided to apply social distancing, Vietnamese Ministry of Education immediately allowed pupils and students to be off school and conduct synchronous e-learning at home. The implementation of this form of Synchronous e-learning this time is not new to both learners and lecturers as well as universities. However, it cannot be said that the form of Synchronous e-learning in Vietnam has been well built or met the needs of learners. There are still a few limitations when the adaptation is temporary in the context of the pandemic. Without major changes in methods and programs, the teaching of skill subjects through the Synchronous e-learning has to face challanges. This causes the students to find it very difficult to learn the subjects and the learning results seem to be not high. The authors choose to study these difficulties to give solutions to the problems.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is known as a degenerative neurological progression that causes the loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex. The cognitive functions are gradually impaired over several to 20 years and no current cure. It is crucial for timely conversion prediction to AD in its earliest phrase. In this study, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) model to obtain biomarkers of brain and clinical diagnosis of each subject from only one to indefinitely forecast the biomarkers and clinical diagnosis at each timepoint in the future. However, unexpected missing observations is a common issue in longitudinal data. Moreover, in recurrent dynamical systems, gates should be closer to 1 to propagate more information from earlier time steps to later ones. Two strategies are explored to handle missing data and improve gating mechanisms in recurrent neural network to boost performance. Empirically, our gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance when longitudinal data is utilized. On the baseline dataset from The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) challenge, our proposal outperforms the conventional recurrent neural network in term of multi-class Area Under Curve (mAUC) which achieving 0.79734 ± 0.01785.},

abstract = {Recently, the spy cameras spotted in private rental places have raised immense privacy concerns. The existing solutions for detecting them require additional support from synchronous external sensing or stimulus hardware such as on/off LED circuits, which require extra obligations from the user. For example, a user needs to carry a smartphone and laboriously perform preset motions (e.g., jumping, waving, and preplanned walking pattern) for synchronous sensing of acceleration signals. These requirements cause considerable discomfort to the user and limit the practicability of prevalent solutions. To cope with this, we propose CSI:DeSpy, an efficient and painless method by leveraging video bitrate fluctuations of the WiFi camera and the passively obtained Channel States Information (CSI) from user motion. CSI:DeSpy includes a self-adaptive feature that makes it robust to detect motion efficiently in multipath-rich environments. We implemented CSI:DeSpy on the Android platform and assessed its performance in diverse real-life scenarios, namely; (1) its reliability with the intensities of physical activities in diverse multipath-rich environments, (2) its practicability with activities of daily living, (3) its unobtrusiveness with passive sensing, and (4) its robustness to different network loads. CSI:DeSpy attained average detection rates of 96.6\%, 96.2\%, 98.5\%, and 93.6\% respectively.},

Therefore, when it comes to privacy and security, clear communication is essential to avoid putting users’ personal data at risk. In this paper, we elicit 32 symbols and metaphors associated with privacy and security through two brainstorming sessions (n = 8, each). Six experts further separated this collection into security and privacy-related symbols and generated clusters based on similarity. Using participants’ clusters, we derived underlying themes. As a result, we present a symbol and metaphor space for privacy and security and discuss their perceived meaning. Our findings can serve researchers, designers, and developers to find suitable symbols or metaphors for a given scenario (e.g., to decide on the interaction metaphor for a tangible security mechanism) and to understand if a symbol is ambiguous or how it may be understood (e.g., is an eye associated with privacy configurations?).

abstract = {With advancements in distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts, tokenized voting rights gained prominence within decentralized finance (DeFi). Voting rights tokens (a.k.a. governance tokens) are fungible tokens that grant individual holders the right to vote upon the fate of a project. The motivation behind these tokens is to achieve decentral control within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Because the initial allocations of these tokens is often undemocratic, the DeFi project and DAO of Yearn Finance experimented with a fair launch allocation where no tokens are pre-mined and all participants have an equal opportunity to receive them. Regardless, research on voting rights tokens highlights the formation of timocracies over time. The consideration is that the tokens’ tradability is the cause of concentration. To examine this proposition, this article uses an agent-based model to simulate and analyze the concentration of voting rights tokens post three fair launch allocation scenarios under different trading modalities. The results show that regardless of the allocation, concentration persistently occurs. It confirms the consideration that the ‘disease’ is endogenous: the cause of concentration is the tokens’ tradability. The findings inform theoretical understandings and practical implications for on-chain governance mediated by tokens.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that are stored and executed on the Blockchain and can receive, manage and transfer money (cryptocurrency units). Two important problems regarding smart contracts are formal analysis and compiler optimization. Formal analysis is extremely important, because smart contracts hold funds worth billions of dollars and their code is immutable after deployment. Hence, an undetected bug can cause significant financial losses. Compiler optimization is also crucial, because every action of a smart contract has to be executed by every node in the Blockchain network. Therefore, optimizations in compiling smart contracts can lead to significant savings in computation, time and energy.Two classical approaches in program analysis and compiler optimization are intraprocedural and interprocedural analysis. In intraprocedural analysis, each function is analyzed separately, while interprocedural analysis considers the entire program. In both cases, the analyses are usually reduced to graph problems over the control flow graph (CFG) of the program. These graph problems are often computationally expensive. Hence, there has been ample research on exploiting structural properties of CFGs for efficient algorithms. One such well-studied property is the treewidth, which is a measure of tree-likeness of graphs. It is known that intraprocedural CFGs of structured programs have treewidth at most 6, whereas the interprocedural treewidth cannot be bounded. This result has been used as a basis for many efficient intraprocedural analyses.In this paper, we explore the idea of exploiting the treewidth of smart contracts for formal analysis and compiler optimization. First, similar to classical programs, we show that the intraprocedural treewidth of structured Solidity and Vyper smart contracts is at most 9. Second, for global analysis, we prove that the interprocedural treewidth of structured smart contracts is bounded by 10 and, in sharp contrast with classical programs, treewidth-based algorithms can be easily applied for interprocedural analysis. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with experiments using a tool we implemented for computing treewidth of smart contracts and show that the treewidth is much lower in practice. We use 36,764 real-world Ethereum smart contracts as benchmarks and find that they have an average treewidth of at most 3.35 for the intraprocedural case and 3.65 for the interprocedural case.},

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing serves as a critical building block for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the sensing devices continuously generate a large amount of data, which consumes much resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, and storage) and may sacrifice the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of applications. Prior work has demonstrated that there is significant redundancy in the content of the sensed data. By judiciously reducing redundant data, data size and load can be significantly reduced, thereby reducing resource cost and facilitating the timely delivery of unique, probably critical information and enhancing QoS. This article presents a survey of existing works on mobile crowdsensing strategies with an emphasis on reducing resource cost and achieving high QoS. We start by introducing the motivation for this survey and present the necessary background of crowdsensing and IoT. We then present various mobile crowdsensing strategies and discuss their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss future research directions for mobile crowdsensing for IoT. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, systems, and applications related to mobile crowdsensing and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyze and compare the strategies proposed in prior works, but also to discuss their applicability toward the IoT and provide guidance on future research directions for mobile crowdsensing.},

abstract = {Live video streaming services have experienced significant growth since the emergence of social networking paradigms in recent years. In this scenario, adaptive bitrate streaming communications transmitted on web protocols provide a convenient and cost-efficient facility to serve various multimedia platforms over the Internet. In these communication models, video content is delivered optimally, possibly transcoded, edited automatically, and cached temporarily by network elements along the path. To this end, the computational capabilities of various network elements are considered as major resources to be optimized for service quality improvements. This article provides a contemporary survey of cutting-edge live video streaming studies from a computation-driven perspective. First, an overview of the global standards, system architectures, and streaming protocols is presented. Next, hierarchical computation-driven models of live video streaming are anatomized, including cloud-, edge-, and peer-to-peer-based solutions. Cutting-edge studies are then reviewed to discover the advances they have made in improving system performance in multiple areas. Finally, open challenges are presented to direct future research in this field.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has attracted the attention of the scientific community and companies, as proven by the exponential growth of publications on this topic in recent years. This growing interest is mainly due to the promise that the use of blockchain enables it to be verified, without including any trusted intermediaries, that the information received from the network is authentic and up-to-date. In this respect, blockchain is a distributed database that can be seen as a ledger that records all transactions that have ever been executed. In this context, smart contracts are pieces of software used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a transaction on a blockchain platform. These pieces of software are implemented by using programming languages, which are sometimes provided by the blockchain platforms themselves. This study aims to (1) identify and categorise the state-of-the-art related to smart contract languages, in terms of the existing languages and their main features, and (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a multivocal mapping study that follows the guidelines proposed by Garousi et&nbsp;al. for conducting multivocal literature reviews, as well as the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for conducting mapping studies. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 4,119 papers were gathered, and 109 of them were selected for extraction. The contributions of this article are twofold: (1) 101 different smart contract languages have been identified and classified according to a variety of criteria; (2) a discussion on the findings and their implications for future research have been outlined. As a conclusion, it could be stated that a rigorous and replicable overview of the state-of-the-art of smart contract languages has been provided that can benefit not only researchers but also practitioners in the field, thanks to its multivocal nature.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology, frequently designated as 'blockchain,' is evolving from its hype phase toward greater maturity and long-term value creation. Although many academic communities were initially slow to grasp the technology's numerous potential implications, meanwhile a substantial amount of research is dedicated to investigating the development and impact of blockchain and related technologies. As undertaken, most research projects take a specific homogenous perspective, such as a technical or business viewpoint. To date, blockchain research studies are largely missing a bridge between and across academic disciplines. Given the manifold implications of blockchain technology, a fruitful crossdisciplinary exchange is therefore needed. In this paper, we bring together researchers with varying expertise to provide a vision into what may be next in terms of concepts, applications, and research agendas. We consider business, economic, societal, legal, technical, and philosophical viewpoints and propose multiple research questions as well as hypotheses arising from these diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, we challenge various academic communities to tackle some of the most crucial issues of current blockchain research and to develop a solid foundation for future exploration.},

School closures were mandated by the Government in an attempt to control the transmission of the virus. Online teaching and learning was then temporarily adopted to ensure students’ continuous learning. However, the effectiveness of this method was far from expectation. Students showed their reluctance to engage in the virtual learning environment. In the meantime, they shared their negative feedback on the traditional teaching and learning method. As a result, lecturers desired to have a more effective approach conducted after the pandemic. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the feasibility of blended learning implementation at some public universities in Vietnam. The results revealed positive feedback from both students and teachers.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that records and verifies transactions across a network of computers and ensures transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. Smart contracts are programs or protocols embedded into the distributed ledgers and are used to automate agreements between parties of a blockchain. Smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks due to their immutable and public nature, thus, it is important to guarantee the correctness of contracts already at design-time in order to avoid catastrophic events and huge loss of money.In this paper, we investigate the usage of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method for the specification, validation and verification of Ethereum smart contracts. We present the ASM model of the Ethereum virtual machine, and we define a set of ASM libraries that simplify smart contracts modeling. We also provide models of malicious contracts in terms of ASM libraries that can be used to check if a given smart contract is vulnerable to a certain attack. As a proof of concept, we show our approach by exploiting the DAO smart contract and its vulnerability to a reentrancy attack.},

abstract = {Social innovation is both the driving force and the goal of participatory design. However, social innovation does not start directly with action but presupposes the creation of meaningful encounters between participants, which requires corresponding commons to allow for various meetings, conversations, and actions that are not circumscribed. Based on literature research and practical experience, this paper argues that trust-building is the key to creating relational commons. This paper reviews literature about trust and participatory design, uncovers a vision of future co-creative communities based on trust and blockchain of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) as a new organizational form, and analyzes in detail the trust mechanisms of participatory design for social innovation, leading to a theoretical framework. This framework argues that shaping trust's cognitive and affective foundations is crucial to building a social innovation network. Subsequent research will enable the integration of blockchain technology with the theoretical framework and verify the model's validity through empirical studies.},

The physical design optimizations commonly improve area, latency (=speed), and power consumption together. This paper is dedicated to improving the physical implementation of FPGA tiles and the configuration storage in SRAM FPGAs. This paper proposes to remap configuration bits and interface wires to implement tightly packed tiles. Using the FABulous FPGA framework, we show that our optimizations are virtually for free but can save over 20\% in area and improve latency at the same time. We will evaluate our approach in different scenarios by changing the available metal layers or the requested channel capacity. Our optimizations consider all tiles and we propose a flow that resolves dependencies between the CLBs and other tiles. Moreover, we will show that frame-based reconfiguration is, in almost all cases, better than shift register configuration.},

abstract = {Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in real-time needs to be done quickly and accurately. During an endoscopic examination, the technical doctor must spend a lot of time classifying anatomical landmarks before proceeding with further work such as lesion detection or abnormal region segmentation. The endoscopist also can ensure the completion of the examination with the help of the anatomical landmarks. In this study, we develop a robust and high-performance neural network classifying ten anatomical landmarks in the Upper Gastrointestinal tract. To this end, the proposed method consists of a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to learn an efficient (dis)similarity metric of a pair of landmarks. We then propose to use the weight that is learned by SNN to a CNN-based structure for the feature extraction. The proposed CNN-based architecture is a lightweight model of Resnet-18 that is designed to achieve the best performance as well as a low cost of computational time. Finally, we utilize an SVM classifier to automatically classify ten anatomical landmarks from the Upper Gastrointestinal endoscopic images. The dataset used in this study is collected in four lighting modes such as (WLI) White-light Imaging, FICE (Flexible spectral imaging color enhancement), BLI (Blue Light Imaging), and LCI (Linked color imaging). The dataset is labeled by endoscopists with more than five years of experience. To enrich the dataset, we also research and evaluate augmentation techniques as effectively as possible. The augmented data includes a combination of the geometrical transforms and the data generated using CycleGAN deep learning networks. The proposed method works well with four lighting modes without depending on a certain lighting mode. It achieved 96.3\% sensitivity, 99.6\% specificity, and 99.3\% accuracy. As a result of the computational time, we achieved approximately 60 FPS (Frame Per Second) using 20W average power with the deep learning framework Pytorch on the Jetson Xavier AGX.},

Supporting this trend, customizable embedded FPGAs are an ingredient in ASIC architectures to provide the advantages of reconfigurable hardware exactly where and how it is most beneficial. To enable this, we are introducing the FABulous embedded open-source FPGA framework. FABulous is designed to fulfill the objectives of ease of use, maximum portability to different process nodes, good control for customization, and delivering good area, power, and performance characteristics of the generated FPGA fabrics. The framework provides templates for logic, arithmetic, memory, and I/O blocks that can be easily stitched together, whilst enabling users to add their own fully customized blocks and primitives. The FABulous ecosystem generates the embedded FPGA fabric for chip fabrication, integrates Yosys, ABC, VPR and nextpnr as FPGA CAD tools, deals with the bitstream generation and after fabrication tests. Additionally, we provide an emulation path for system development. FABulous was demonstrated for an ASIC integrating a RISC-V core with an embedded FPGA fabric for custom instruction set extensions using a TSMC 180nm process and an open-source 45nm process node.},

Our results show that abusive resources are spread in the Alexa ranking, websites particularly generic Top Level Domain (TLD) and their recently registered domains. In addition, websites with malicious resources are mainly located in China while cryptomining is located in USA. We further evaluate possible counter-measures against abusive web resources. We observe that ad or privacy block lists are ineffective to block against malicious resources while coin-blocking lists are powerful enough to mitigate in-browser cryptomining. Our observations shed light on a little studied, yet important, aspect of abusive resources, and can help increase user awareness about the malicious resources and drive-by mining on web browsers.},

abstract = {This paper describes Slither, a static analysis framework designed to provide rich information about Ethereum smart contracts. It works by converting Solidity smart contracts into an intermediate representation called SlithIR. SlithIR uses Static Single Assignment (SSA) form and a reduced instruction set to ease implementation of analyses while preserving semantic information that would be lost in transforming Solidity to bytecode. Slither allows for the application of commonly used program analysis techniques like dataflow and taint tracking. Our framework has four main use cases: (1) automated detection of vulnerabilities, (2) automated detection of code optimization opportunities, (3) improvement of the user's understanding of the contracts, and (4) assistance with code review.In this paper, we present an overview of Slither, detail the design of its intermediate representation, and evaluate its capabilities on real-world contracts. We show that Slither's bug detection is fast, accurate, and outperforms other static analysis tools at finding issues in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of speed, robustness, and balance of detection and false positives. We compared tools using a large dataset of smart contracts and manually reviewed results for 1000 of the most used contracts.},

abstract = {In this paper, we aim to develop a diagnostic assistant system for labelling the stomach anatomical locations in upper GastroIntestinal Endoscopy (UGIE) examination. To address this task, we construct an appropriate manner which utilizes both ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and supportive interactions between machine and doctors. We solve the problem by a two-phase scheme. The first is a coarse-phase to classify seven major anatomical locations including cardiac orifice, gastric body, fundic, antrum, pyloric ring, lesser curvature and greater curvature using advances of a CNN. The constructed CNN network is compact with high performance and appropriate integration into a Graphic User Interface (GUI). In order to classify with 13 further detailed positions, a GUI is developed so that the endoscopists can conveniently specify the anatomical locations from results of the coarse-phase. In this the fine-phase, the doctors will prune the automatic results as well as specify the more detailed positions of each major location. In the experimental results, the developed application is shown as an efficient way in an UGIE diagnosis. It reduces a significant time from averagely 13:03 minutes in a manual procedure to 4:35 minutes by using the developed system when comparing with trainee endoscopists. The results of specifying anatomical locations satisfied accuracy requirements and showed promising research trend for future application as a computer-aided GIE diagnostic system.},

We found that those surveys are basically studying the blockchain-based applications, such as blockchain-assisted Internet of Things (IoT), business applications, security-enabled solutions, and many other applications in diverse fields. However, we think that a comprehensive survey toward the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized for future research directions. We hope this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.},

abstract = {Design-time evaluation is essential to build the initial software architecture to be deployed. However, experts’ assumptions made at design-time are unlikely to remain true indefinitely in systems that are characterized by scale, hyperconnectivity, dynamism, and uncertainty in operations (e.g. IoT). Therefore, experts’ design-time decisions can be challenged at run-time. A continuous architecture evaluation that systematically assesses and intertwines design-time and run-time decisions is thus necessary. This paper proposes the first proactive approach to continuous architecture evaluation of the system leveraging the support of simulation. The approach evaluates software architectures by not only tracking their performance over time, but also forecasting their likely future performance through machine learning of simulated instances of the architecture. This enables architects to make cost-effective informed decisions on potential changes to the architecture. We perform an IoT case study to show how machine learning on simulated instances of architecture can fundamentally guide the continuous evaluation process and influence the outcome of architecture decisions. A series of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach. We also provide the architect with recommendations on how to best benefit from the approach through choice of learners and input parameters, grounded on experimentation and evidence.},
