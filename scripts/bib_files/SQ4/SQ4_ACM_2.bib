abstract = {Chronic patient self-management is crucial for maintaining physical and psychological health, reducing pressure on healthcare systems, and promoting patient empowerment. Digital technologies, particularly chatbots, have emerged as powerful tools for supporting patients in managing their chronic conditions. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown potential in improving chatbot-based systems in healthcare. However, their adoption in clinical practice faces challenges, including reliability, the need for clinical trials, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes a general architecture for developing an LLM-based chatbot system that supports chronic patients while addressing privacy and security concerns. The architecture is designed to be independent of specific technologies and health conditions, focusing on data protection legislation compliance. A prototype of the system has been developed for hypertension management, demonstrating its potential for motivating patients to monitor their blood pressure and adhere to prescriptions.},

abstract = {The security and usability of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications depend on the secure management of cryptographic keys. However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work we first revisit the problem of threshold ECDSA by considering the commonly admissible 'server-aided' model, namely, the presence of a semi-honest and non-colluding service provider. Then, we leverage that model and consider cases where that 'server' is distributed, introducing the novel concept of unstoppable wallets; hence eliminating any single point of failure. Unstoppable wallets are programmable threshold ECDSA wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We construct highly efficient threshold ECDSA protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security in the server-aided model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority among the signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold ECDSA key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead.We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these protocols, written in a smart contract language, deployed on the Secret Network - a blockchain that plays the role of the server. Using that deployment, we showcase the protocols' applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.},

A smart city is a system that connects groups of devices which produce and share a vast amount of information. Because of this large amount of data that travels between devices, there must be an organizational structure to organize and manage this movement. The basic characteristics of this system are transparent, decentralized, autonomy and immutable. All of these properties can be provided by BC Technology.

The proposed framework does not need a global coordinate system, which makes it more practical to be implemented in a physical robotic system. Moreover, an adaptation mechanism is included in the framework so that the self-organization algorithm is robust to changes in the number of robots. Various case studies of multirobot pattern formation and boundary coverage show the effectiveness of the framework.},

Using these metrics, we show that systems with heavy-tailed lifetime distributions are more resilient than those with light-tailed (e.g., exponential) distributions and that for a given average degree, k-regular graphs exhibit the highest level of fault tolerance. As a practical illustration of our results, each user in a system with n = 100 billion peers, 30-minute average lifetime, and 1-minute node-replacement delay can stay connected to the graph with probability 1 - 1/n using only 9 neighbors. This is in contrast to 37 neighbors required under previous modeling efforts. We finish the paper by observing that many P2P networks are almost surely (i.e., with probability 1 -- o(1)) connected if they have no isolated nodes and derive a simple model for the probability that a P2P system partitions under churn.},

abstract = {We address the problem of engineering self-organizing electronic institutions for resource allocation in open, embedded, and resource-constrained systems. In such systems, there is decentralized control, competition for resources and an expectation of both intentional and unintentional errors. The “optimal” distribution of resources is then less important than the endurance of the distribution mechanism. Under these circumstances, we propose to model resource allocation as a common-pool resource management problem, and develop a formal characterization of Elinor Ostrom’s socio-economic principles for self-governing institutions. This article applies a method for sociologically inspired computing to give a complete axiomatization of six of Ostrom’s eight principles in the Event Calculus. A testbed is implemented for experimenting with the axiomatization. The experimental results show that these principles support enduring institutions, in terms of longevity and membership, and also provide insight into calibrating the transaction and running costs associated with implementing the principles against the behavioral profile of the institutional membership. We conclude that it is possible to express Ostrom’s principles in logical form and that they are necessary and sufficient conditions for enduring self-organizing electronic institutions to manage sustainable common-pool resources.},

The security of DNS has always been a hot issue in network security research. Traditional research work mainly improves the security protection capabilities of the DNS system by designing security-enhanced protocols. However, frequent DNS security incidents in recent years have shown that simply improving the DNS protocol cannot completely eliminate the security threats faced by the DNS system. Decentralization of DNS is a novel idea to improve the security capability of DNS system. Unlike traditional solutions, DNS decentralization technology is dedicated to changing the architecture of the DNS system and the domain name resolution process. This article analyzes and summarizes representative research work in the past 20 years for DNS decentralization technology, and discusses the development trend of future research.},

abstract = {This paper studies the decentralized optimization and learning problem where multiple interconnected agents aim to learn an optimal decision function defined over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space by jointly minimizing a global objective function, with access to their own locally observed dataset. As a non-parametric approach, kernel learning faces a major challenge in distributed implementation: the decision variables of local objective functions are data-dependent and thus cannot be optimized under the decentralized consensus framework without any raw data exchange among agents. To circumvent this major challenge, we leverage the random feature (RF) approximation approach to enable consensus on the function modeled in the RF space by data-independent parameters across different agents. We then design an iterative algorithm, termed DKLA, for fast-convergent implementation via ADMM. Based on DKLA, we further develop a communication-censored kernel learning (COKE) algorithm that reduces the communication load of DKLA by preventing an agent from transmitting at every iteration unless its local updates are deemed informative. Theoretical results in terms of linear convergence guarantee and generalization performance analysis of DKLA and COKE are provided. Comprehensive tests on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to verify the communication efficiency and learning effectiveness of COKE.},

Device swarms are smart, mobile, and interconnected devices that operate in large numbers and are likely to be part of emerging applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). Swarm devices process and exchange safety, privacy, and mission-critical information. Thus, it is important to have a good code verification technique that scales to device swarms and establishes trust among collaborating devices. DADS has several advantages over current state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques: It is decentralized, has no single point of failure, and can handle changing topologies after nodes are compromised. DADS assures system resilience to node compromise/failure while guaranteeing only devices that execute genuine code remain part of the group. We conduct performance measurements of communication, computation, memory, and energy using the TrustLite embedded systems architecture in OMNeT++ simulation environment. We show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce communication cost and is very efficient in terms of computation, memory, and energy requirements. We also analyze security and show that DADS is very effective and robust against various attacks.},

In this study, we respond to the empirical gap in the understanding of IT-enabled effectiveness in the government organizations in developing countries. We report the findings of an exploratory case study conducted at the Directorate of Income Tax (DIT) in India. We use RBV and dynamic capabilities perspective of the firm in addition to notions of complementarity and simultaneity as theoretical lenses to analyze the case. Our findings and analysis indicate that the strong capabilities in matching, choosing, assessing, and executing IT opportunities affect IT-enabled value in government organizations. Our study also highlights the significance of complementary and simultaneous development and execution of IT related capabilities.

abstract = {Online Social Networks exploit a lightweight process to identify their users so as to facilitate their fast adoption. However, such convenience comes at the price of making legitimate users subject to different threats created by fake accounts. Therefore, there is a crucial need to empower users with tools helping them in assigning a level of trust to whomever they interact with. To cope with this issue, in this paper we introduce a novel model, DIVa, that leverages on mining techniques to find correlations among user profile attributes. These correlations are discovered not from user population as a whole, but from individual communities, where the correlations are more pronounced. DIVa exploits a decentralized learning approach and ensures privacy preservation as each node in the OSN independently processes its local data and is required to know only its direct neighbors. Extensive experiments using real-world OSN datasets show that DIVa is able to extract fine-grained community-aware correlations among profile attributes with average improvements up to 50\% than the global approach.},

abstract = {This paper suggests a speculative scenario for the Israeli games industry. In this scenario we live in a cosmopolitan age whereby digital games produced in the peripheral countries will attain global acknowledgement by incorporating local attributes first. We propose cosmopolitanism as a strategy for imagining alternative futures for emergent game endeavors around the globe. Cosmopolitanism can be considered as a global identity that transcends cultures and countries and brings together cultural elements from different parts of the world. It is a perspective that emphasizes the search for more inclusive forms of social relations between “global citizens” and a global outlook and openness to difference.By way of example, we chose several nationally acclaimed Israeli games as a case study. This paper will explore an alternative future for these games. By doing so, we hope to open such dialogue and call developers around the globe to adopt a cosmopolitan way of making games.},

abstract = {Blockchain has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries by providing trustlessness. To comprehensively examine blockchain systems, this article presents both a macro-level overview on the most popular blockchain systems, and a micro-level analysis on a general blockchain framework and its crucial components. The macro-level exploration provides a big picture on the endeavors made by blockchain professionals over the years to enhance the blockchain performance while the micro-level investigation details the blockchain building blocks for deep technology comprehension. More specifically, this article introduces a general modular blockchain analytic framework that decomposes a blockchain system into interacting modules and then examines the major modules to cover the essential blockchain components of network, consensus, and distributed ledger at the micro-level. The framework as well as the modular analysis jointly build a foundation for designing scalable, flexible, and application-adaptive blockchains that can meet diverse requirements. Additionally, this article explores popular technologies that can be integrated with blockchain to expand functionality and highlights major challenges. Such a study provides critical insights to overcome the obstacles in designing novel blockchain systems and facilitates the further development of blockchain as a digital infrastructure to service new applications.},

abstract = {The Grid and agent communities both develop concepts and mechanisms for open distributed systems, albeit from different perspectives. The Grid community has historically focused on "brawn": infrastructure, tools, and applications for reliable and secure resource sharing within dynamic and geographically distributed virtual organizations. In contrast, the agents community has focused on "brain": autonomous problem solvers that can act flexibly in uncertain and dynamic environments. Yet as the scale and ambition of both Grid and agent deployments increase, we see a convergence of interests, with agent systems requiring robust infrastructure and Grid systems requiring autonomous, flexible behaviors. Motivated by this convergence of interests, we review the current state of the art in both areas, review the challenges that concern the two communities, and propose research and technology development activities that can allow for mutually supportive efforts.},

We have designed a set of protocols that implement a distributed, decentralized desktop grid via P2P techniques. Incoming jobs having different types of resource requirements are matched with system nodes through proximity in an N-dimensional resource space.In this paper, we address problems that arise from static load balancing mechanisms for assigning jobs to nodes that can arise for various reasons, including the heterogeneity of the available nodes or the jobs to be run, and from stale information in the P2P system. We greatly improve upon our prior work by providing lightweight yet effective dynamic load balancing mechanisms to overcome load imbalances caused by the limitations of the initial static job assignment scheme. Unlike other systems, we can effectively support resource constraints of jobs during the course of redistribution since we simplify the problem of matchmaking through building a multi-dimensional resource space and mapping jobs and nodes to this space. Throughout extensive simulation results, we show that dynamic load balancing makes the overall system more scalable, by improving system throughput and response time with low additional overhead.},

For analyzing properties of complex systems, a mathematical model for these systems may be useful. Whether a model with discrete time or with continuous time fits better, depends on the properties of the system and which analysis should be done in the model. In this paper we give a comparison between discrete and continuous models and we give a formal definition for modeling continuous complex systems.

Recognizing that AI reasoning measures cannot be wholly automated, due to factors such as cultural complexity, we conducted an extensive examination of five commercial Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), focusing on their comprehension and interpretation of culturally intricate contexts. Utilizing our novel “Reasoning and Value Alignment Test”, we assessed the GPT models’ ability to reason in complex situations and grasp local cultural subtleties. Our findings have indicated that, although the models have exhibited high levels of human-like reasoning, significant limitations remained, especially concerning the interpretation of cultural contexts. This paper also explored potential applications and use-cases of our Test, underlining its significance in AI training, ethics compliance, sensitivity auditing, and AI-driven cultural consultation. We concluded by emphasizing its broader implications in the AGI domain, highlighting the necessity for interdisciplinary approaches, wider accessibility to various GPT models, and a profound understanding of the interplay between GPT reasoning and cultural sensitivity.},

abstract = {Social robots, both when acting individually and in groups, need to manage their own energy use effectively. An uneven energy distribution in a swarm of robots performing a mission may prevent completion of the group's mission or reduce its tolerance for adverse events that occur during mission execution. The goal of effectively managing energy use in a swarm is known as collective energy homeostasis. While previous works have mainly focused on achieving this goal by direct energy exchange methods (e.g., using battery charging mechanisms), this paper presents a novel bio-inspired approach for maintaining collective energy homeostasis in social robot swarms. The approach extends Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques for task selection and motion planning for individual robots by making them sensitive to the robot's energy state. The overall effect of this Energy-based PSO (EPSO) algorithm is to shift energy-intensive tasks towards robots in the swarm that have higher energy levels, i.e. energy load-leveling, which improves energy self-sufficiency and its homogeneity across the swarm. This can be considered a form of indirect energy exchange by task shifting. Experimental results show that the EPSO algorithm enables social robot swarms to maintain collective energy homeostasis more effectively than previous approaches, reducing the variance of energy between individuals by 49\%, and extending the number of missions that a swarm can achieve, given a fixed initial energy budget.},

abstract = {We feel that, rather than asking whether biomedical investigators should be supported by centralized or decentralized computers, we should ask how investigators may be given effective access to the various kinds of computing service they require. Optimality of a computer configuration cannot be meaningfully assessed apart from the job-mix priorities it is to serve. It is difficult to think of an area of application wherein requirements would differ more from location to location than in biomedical computing. What is good for control of on-line experiments in a physiological laboratory would tend to be inefficient or altogether inadequate for processing the major statistical computations widely encountered in biology and medicine. Conversely, it would usually be uneconomical to tie up a system well suited to statistical computations for continual monitoring of experiments. Not only do we find a spectrum of biologists whose requirements range from control of experiments to complex modeling and statistical analysis, we also find the entire spectrum represented in the work of a single investigator—often, in fact, in a single study. Thus, after preliminary reduction by the laboratory computer, the neurophysiologist's data may require major statistical analysis. In fact, it is likely that occasional bursts of such major support during the course of an experiment might be desired for more sophisticated guidance of the experiment.},

abstract = {In order to traverse through a complex environment, swarm robotic systems need to self-organize themselves to form different yet suitable shapes dynamically to adapt to unknown environments. Biological morphogenetic networks, such as gene regulatory networks (GRNs), are modular with independent units and often show the reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Inspired by biological morphogenesis and evolution and structure of network motifs in biology, in this paper, we propose an evolving GRN-based approach for self-organizing robotic swarms to autonomously generate dynamic patterns in unknown environments. The basic idea of this GRN-based model is: first, several network motifs are predefined as the basic building blocks for GRNs, then an evolutionary algorithm is applied to evolve parameters and the structures of the GRNs model. Then a previously proposed bio-inspired pattern formation algorithm is applied to move robots to generated patterns automatically in a distributed manner. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed bio-inspired model is effective for complex shape generation and formation and robust to environmental changes in complex unknown environments.},

Therein, the strategic planning process, plan execution, and routine daily tasks are carried out, conceptually, in the same manner. Furthermore, the plans themselves may be reconfigured or modified according to changing organisational and architectural models for IT activities. The work assumes a formal model of time that enables one to track institutional transformations over time.

abstract = {Decentralized cooperation in partially-observable multi-agent systems requires effective communications among agents. To support this effort, this work focuses on the class of problems where global communications are available but may be unreliable, thus precluding differentiable communication learning methods. We introduce FCMNet, a reinforcement learning based approach that allows agents to simultaneously learn a) an effective multi-hop communications protocol and b) a common, decentralized policy that enables team-level decision-making. Specifically, our proposed method utilizes the hidden states of multiple directional recurrent neural networks as communication messages among agents. Using a simple multi-hop topology, we endow each agent with the ability to receive information sequentially encoded by every other agent at each time step, leading to improved global cooperation. We demonstrate FCMNet on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks with shared rewards, as well as a collaborative multi-agent pathfinding task with individual rewards. There, our comparison results show that FCMNet outperforms state-of-the-art communication-based reinforcement learning methods in all StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, and value decomposition methods in certain tasks. We further investigate the robustness of FCMNet under realistic communication disturbances, such as random message loss or binarized messages (i.e., non-differentiable communication channels), to showcase FMCNet's potential applicability to robotic tasks under a variety of real-world conditions.},

This automation enables numerous useful real-life use-cases, such as smart transport, smart living, smart cities, and so on. However, recent industry surveys reflect that data-related challenges are responsible for slower growth of IoT in recent years. For this reason, this article presents a systematic and comprehensive survey on IoT Big Data (IoTBD) with the aim to identify the uncharted challenges for IoTBD. This article analyzes the state-of-the-art academic works in IoT and big data management across various domains and proposes a taxonomy for IoTBD management. Then, the survey explores the IoT portfolio of major cloud vendors and provides a classification of vendor services for the integration of IoT and IoTBD on their cloud platforms. After that, the survey identifies the IoTBD challenges in terms of 13 V’s challenges and envisions IoTBD as “Big Data 2.0.” Then the survey provides comprehensive analysis of recent works that address IoTBD challenges by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses to assess the recent trends and future research directions. Finally, the survey concludes with discussion on open research issues for IoTBD.},

abstract = {Extensive literature exists studying decentralized coordination and consensus, with considerable attention devoted to ensuring robustness to faults and attacks. However, most of the latter literature assumes that non-malicious agents follow simple stylized rules. In reality, decentralized protocols often involve humans, and understanding how people coordinate in adversarial settings is an open problem. We initiate a study of this problem, starting with a human subjects investigation of human coordination on networks in the presence of adversarial agents, and subsequently using the resulting data to bootstrap the development of a credible agent-based model of adversarial decentralized coordination. In human subjects experiments, we observe that while adversarial nodes can successfully prevent consensus, the ability to communicate can significantly improve robustness, with the impact particularly significant in scale-free networks. On the other hand, and contrary to typical stylized models of behavior, we show that the existence of trusted nodes has limited utility. Next, we use the data collected in human subject experiments to develop a data-driven agent-based model of adversarial coordination. We show that this model successfully reproduces observed behavior in experiments, is robust to small errors in individual agent models, and illustrate its utility by using it to explore the impact of optimizing network location of trusted and adversarial nodes.},

abstract = {Humans working with autonomous artificially intelligent systems may not be experts in the inner workings of their machine teammates, but need to understand when to employ, trust, and rely on the system. A critical challenge is to develop machine agents with the capacity to understand their own capabilities and limitations, and the ability to communicate this information to human partners. Self-assessment is an emerging field that tackles this challenge through the development of algorithms that enable autonomous agents to understand and communicate their competency. These methods can engender appropriate trust and align human expectations with autonomous assistant abilities. However, current research in self-assessment is dispersed across many fields, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and human factors. This survey connects work from these disparate areas and reviews state-of-the-art methods for algorithmic self-assessments that enable autonomous agents to estimate, understand, and communicate valuable information pertaining to their competency, with focus on methods that can improve interactions within human-machine teams. To better understand the landscape of self-assessment approaches, we present a framework for categorizing work in self-assessment based on underlying algorithm type: test-based, learning-based, or knowledge-based. We synthesize common features across these approaches and discuss relevant future directions for research in this emerging space.},

The data management layer simultaneously supports multiple update protocols for single logical data-item, allowing different levels of performance and consistency to be offered to different groups of users. How replication is applied is key to maximising system performance. The challenge lies in the fact that the optimal scheme depends on dynamic characteristics of the workload.

The presented work is intended as an investigation and proof of concept into the feasibility of autonomically managing a facet of replication: specifically, the number of replicas. Replica placement and optimality of management decisions is currently considered out of scope and part of future work.},

abstract = {The Web has known a very fast evolution: going from the Web 1.0, known as Web of Documents where users are merely consumers of static information, to the more dynamic Web 2.0, known as social or collaborative Web where users produce and consume information simultaneously, and entering the more sophisticated Web 3.0, known as the Semantic Web by giving information a well-defined meaning so that it becomes more easily accessible by human users and automated processes. Fostering service intelligence and atomicity (the ability of autonomous services to interact automatically), remains one of the most upcoming challenges of the Semantic Web. This promotes the dawn of a new era: the Intelligent Web (Web 4.0), known as the Internet of Things (IoT), an extension of the Semantic Web where (physical/software) objects and services autonomously interact in a multimedia virtual environment, provided with embedded communication capabilities, common semantics and addressing schemes, promoting the concept of Digital Web Ecosystems where every where (human and software) agents collaborate, interact, compete, and evolve autonomously in order to automatically solve complex and dynamic problems. This paper briefly describes the recent evolution of the Web providing an overview of the technological breakthroughs contributing to this evolution, covering: knowledge bases and semantic data description, XML-based data representation and manipulation technologies (i.e., RDF, RDFS, OWL, and SPARQL) as well as the main challenges toward achieving the Intelligent Web: connectivity, semantic heterogeneity, collective knowledge management, collective intelligence, as well as data sustainability and evolution. We also present some of the main application domains characterizing the Intelligent (Semantic) Web, from information retrieval and content analysis, to systems status monitoring and improving business life-cycle through ubiquitous computing.},

abstract = {Adaptiveness in distributed parallel applications is a key feature to provide satisfactory performance results in the face of unexpected events such as workload variations and time-varying user requirements. The adaptation process is based on the ability to change specific characteristics of parallel components (e.g., their parallelism degree) and to guarantee that such modifications of the application configuration are effective and durable. Reconfigurations often incur a cost on the execution (a performance overhead and/or an economic cost). For this reason advanced adaptation strategies have become of paramount importance. Effective strategies must achieve properties like control optimality (making decisions that optimize the global application QoS), reconfiguration stability expressed in terms of the average time between consecutive reconfigurations of the same component, and optimizing the reconfiguration amplitude (number of allocated/deallocated resources). To control such parameters, in this article we propose a method based on a Cooperative Model-based Predictive Control approach in which application controllers cooperate to make optimal reconfigurations and taking account of the durability and amplitude of their control decisions. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the methodology is demonstrated through experiments performed in a simulation environment and by comparing it with other existing techniques.},

abstract = {As autonomous systems are deployed at a large scale in both public and private spaces, robots owned and operated by competing organisations will be required to interact. Interactions in such settings will be inherently non-cooperative. In this paper, we address the problem of non-cooperative multi-agent path finding. We design an auction mechanism that allows a group of agents to reach their goals whilst minimising the total cost of the system. In particular, we aim to design a mechanism such that rational agents are incentivised to participate. Our privileged knowledge auction consists of a modified combinatorial Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction. Our approach limits the initial number of bids in the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction, then uses the privileged knowledge of the auctioneer to identify and solve path conflicts. In order to maintain agent autonomy in the non-cooperative system, individual agents are provided with final say over paths. The mechanism provides a heuristic method to maximise social welfare whilst remaining computationally efficient. We also consider single-agent bid generation and propose a similarity metric to use in dissimilar shortest path generation. We then show this bid generation method increases the success likelihood of both the limited-bid VCG auction and our novel approach on synthetic data. Our experiments with synthetic data outperform existing work on the non-cooperative problem.},

Our main contribution is to design the PastryGrid protocol (based on Pastry) for DG in order to decentralise the execution of a distributed application with precedence between tasks. Comparing to a centralised system, we evaluate our approach over 205 machines executing 2500 tasks. The results show that our decentralised system runs better than the same system configured as a master/slave because it gives less overhead.},

Thus, two critical points are identified in making the above goal a reality; effective representation as well as effective retrieval and exploitation of multimedia content. For accomplishing the above goal researchers have started to use ontologies in the field of multimedia in order to construct machine-understandable, descriptive versions of the multimedia content based on multimedia ontologies.

Although tests and simulations give us an excellent overview of the protocol behaviour, the formal verification is needed to prove the correctness of a system. We formally specify and verify the properties of our proposal by the use of PROMELA/SPIN model checker.
