 abstract = {Media production and consumption behaviors are changing in response to new technologies and demands, giving birth to a new generation of social applications. Among them, crowd journalism represents a novel way of constructing democratic and trustworthy news relying on ordinary citizens arriving at breaking news locations and capturing relevant videos using their smartphones. The ARTICONF project [1] proposes a trustworthy, resilient, and globally sustainable toolset for developing decentralized applications (DApps). Leveraging the ARTICONF tools, we introduce a new DApp for crowd journalism called MOGPlay. MOGPlay collects and manages audio-visual content generated by citizens and provides a secure blockchain platform that rewards all stakeholders involved in professional news production. Besides live streaming, MOGPlay offers a marketplace for audio-visual content trading among citizens and free journalists with an internal token ecosystem. We discuss the functionality and implementation of the MOGPlay DApp and illustrate three pilot crowd journalism live scenarios that validate the prototype.},

 abstract = {The democratization of Internet of Things and ubiquitous computing equips citizens with phenomenal new ways for online participation and decision-making in application domains of smart grids and smart cities. When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing. The contribution of an I-EPOS open source software suite implemented as a paradigmatic artifact for community aspires to settle a knowledge exchange for the design of new algorithms and application scenarios of sharing economies towards highly participatory and sustainable digital societies.},

 abstract = {Managing the privileges of occupants and visitors of large commercial buildings to access different building areas, control systems and equipment therein is a challenging task. The best practice today involves giving long-term building occupants, for example employees working in the building, access privileges to their organization areas and requiring visitors to be escorted by them. This approach is conservative and inflexible. Ideally, an automated solution is needed to manage access delegations; however, traditional role-based access control models are unwieldy in that they require the specification of all roles and their relative authority, which is a challenge in large buildings home of multiple organizations and numerous visitors. In this paper, we present a methodology based on blockchain smart contracts to describe, grant, and revoke fine-grained permissions for building users in a decentralized fashion. This method supports access control using resource description framework (RDF) graphs and implements two APIs for client applications. Leveraging the metadata of a real building, we have applied the proposed method to manage privileges in some realistic use-cases and shown that it can greatly reduce the administration overhead while providing fine-grained access control.},

 abstract = {In an active noise control ANC system, computational complexity is one major concern when designing practical control algorithms. For an ANC system with multiple secondary sources and error microphones, one approach to reducing computational complexity is to apply a decentralized control scheme rather than centralized approaches. A decentralized scheme attempts to control a number of small-size ANC subsystems independently. In this paper, we consider the decentralized control of a two-channel ANC system tackling a noise disturbance in the frequency domain, where each channel consists of one secondary source and one error microphone. We propose a decentralized control method that is able to achieve the same noise reduction performance as the centralized controller with guaranteed convergence. The key step in designing the control method is to properly shape the eigenvalues of a matrix that models the two-channel secondary paths for each frequency index.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the benefits of cooperation and proposes a relay activation strategy for a large wireless network with multiple transmitters. In this framework, some nodes cooperate with a nearby node that acts as a relay, using the decode-and-forward protocol, and others use direct transmission. The network is modeled as an independently marked Poisson point process, and the source nodes may choose their relays from the set of inactive nodes. Although cooperation can potentially lead to significant improvements in the performance of a communication pair, relaying causes additional interference in the network, increasing the average noise that other nodes see. We investigate how source nodes should balance cooperation versus interference to obtain reliable transmissions, and for this purpose, we study and optimize a relay activation strategy with respect to the outage probability. Surprisingly, in the high reliability regime, the optimized strategy consists on the activation of all the relays or none at all, depending on network parameters. We provide a simple closed-form expression that indicates when the relays should be active, and we introduce closed-form expressions that quantify the performance gains of this scheme with respect to a network that only uses direct transmission.},

 abstract = {Replicating or caching popular content in memories distributed across the network is a technique to reduce peak network loads. Conventionally, the main performance gain of this caching was thought to result from making part of the requested data available closer to end-users. Instead, we recently showed that a much more significant gain can be achieved by using caches to create coded-multicasting opportunities, even for users with different demands, through coding across data streams. These coded-multicasting opportunities are enabled by careful content overlap at the various caches in the network, created by a central coordinating server. In many scenarios, such a central coordinating server may not be available, raising the question if this multicasting gain can still be achieved in a more decentralized setting. In this paper, we propose an efficient caching scheme, in which the content placement is performed in a decentralized manner. In other words, no coordination is required for the content placement. Despite this lack of coordination, the proposed scheme is nevertheless able to create coded-multicasting opportunities and achieves a rate close to the optimal centralized scheme.},

 abstract = {The performance of large-scale peer-to-peer P2P video-on-demand VoD streaming systems can be very challenging to analyze due to sparse connectivity and complex, random dynamics. Specifically, in practical P2P VoD systems, each peer only interacts with a small number of other peers/neighbors. Furthermore, its upload capacity, downloading position, and content availability change dynamically and randomly. In this paper, we rigorously study large-scale P2P VoD systems with sparse connectivity among peers and investigate simple and decentralized P2P control strategies that can provably achieve close-to-optimal streaming capacity. We first focus on a single streaming channel. Using a simple algorithm that assigns each peer a random set of $Theta log N$  neighbors and allocates upload capacity uniformly, we show that a close-to-optimal streaming rate can be asymptotically achieved for all peers with high probability as the number of peers $N$ increases. Furthermore, the tracker does not need to obtain detailed knowledge of which chunks each peer caches, and hence incurs low overhead. We then study multiple streaming channels where peers watching one channel may help peers in another channel with insufficient upload bandwidth. We propose a simple random cache-placement strategy and show that a close-to-optimal streaming capacity region for all channels can be attained with high probability, again with only $Theta log N$  per-peer neighbors. These results provide important insights into the dynamics of large-scale P2P VoD systems, which will be useful for guiding the design of improved P2P control protocols.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of efficient content delivery over networks in which individual nodes are equipped with content caching capabilities. We present a flexible methodology for the design of cooperative, decentralized caching strategies that can adapt to real-time changes in regional content popularity. This design methodology makes use of a recently proposed reduced consensus optimization scheme, in which a number of networked agents cooperate in locating the optimum of the sum of their individual, privately known objective functions. The outcome of the design is a set of dynamic update rules that stipulate how much and which portions of each content piece an individual network node ought to cache. In implementing these update rules, the nodes achieve a collectively optimal caching configuration through nearest-neighbor interactions and measurements of local content request rates only. Moreover, individual nodes need not be aware of the overall network topology or how many other nodes are on the network. The desired caching behavior is encoded in the design of individual nodes' costs and can incorporate a variety of network performance criteria. Using the proposed methodology, we develop a set of content-caching update rules designed to minimize the energy consumption of the network as a whole by dynamically trading off transport and caching energy costs in response to changes in content demand.},

@article{10.1109/TNET.2020.2986252,
 abstract = {Always keeping a certain distance between vehicles in a platoon system is important for collision avoidance. Centralized platoon systems let the leader vehicle determine and notify the velocities of all the vehicles in the platoon. Unfortunately, such a centralized method generates high packet drop rate and communication delay due to the leader vehicle's limited communication capability. Therefore, we propose a decentralized platoon network, in which each vehicle determines its velocity by only communicating with the vehicles in a short range. However, the multiple simultaneous transmissions between different pairs of vehicles may interfere with each other. By leveraging a typical feature of a platoon, we devise a channel allocation algorithm, called the Fast and Lightweight Autonomous channel selection algorithm (FLA), in which each vehicle determines its channel simply based on its distance to the leader vehicle. We also devise a strategy, in which a succeeding vehicle uses its stored common velocity profile when it is disconnected from its preceding vehicle and then adjusts its velocity once the connection is built. We conduct experiments on NS-3 and Matlab to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods and implement a real-world prototype by equipping vehicles with Android mobile devices. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our decentralized platoon network over the previous centralized platoon networks.},

 abstract = {In this work, we perform a comparative study of centralized and decentralized update strategies for the basic remote tracking problem of many distributed users/devices with randomly evolving states. Our goal is to reveal the impact of the fundamentally different tradeoffs that exist between information accuracy and communication cost under these two update paradigms. In one extreme, decentralized updates are triggered by distributed users/transmitters based on exact local state-information, but also at a higher cost due to the need for uncoordinated multi-user communication. In the other extreme, centralized updates are triggered by the common tracker/receiver based on estimated global state-information, but also at a lower cost due to the capability of coordinated multi-user communication. We use a generic superlinear function to model the communication cost with respect to the number of simultaneous updates for multiple sources. We characterize the conditions under which transmitter-driven decentralized update policies outperform their receiver-driven centralized counterparts for symmetric sources, and vice versa. Further, we extend the results to a scenario where system parameters are unknown and develop learning-based update policies that asymptotically achieve the minimum cost levels attained by the optimal policies.},

These algorithms require minimal computing and storage capabilities at each node and when properly tuned, they are not expected to overload the nodes or the network that connects these nodes. These properties make gossip interesting for future exascale systems. This paper examines the overhead of a decentralized gossip algorithm on the performance of parallel MPI applications running on up to 8192 nodes of an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer. The applications that were used in the experiments include PTRANS and MPI-FFT from the HPCC benchmark suite as well as the coupled weather and cloud simulation model COSMO-SPECS+FD4. In most cases, no gossip overhead was observed when the gossip messages were sent at intervals of 256ms or more. As expected, the overhead that is observed at higher rates is sensitive to the communication pattern of the application and the amount of gossip information being circulated.},

Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and model based—limitations that we address by distributed reinforcement learning (RL). We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL. However, alternate learning requires an initial policy. We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach. We empirically demonstrate that the refined approach produces near-optimal solutions in many challenging benchmark settings, staking a claim to being an efficient (and realistic) approximate solver in its own right. Furthermore, alternate best response learning seeded with such policies quickly learns high-quality policies as well.},

@article{10.1145/2723771,
 abstract = {In a decentralized storage system, agents replicate each other’s data to increase availability. Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners’ availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents’ availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents’ matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running.We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an “adoption” mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents.},

These correlations are discovered not from user population as a whole, but from individual communities, where the correlations are more pronounced. DIVa exploits a decentralized learning approach and ensures privacy preservation as each node in the OSN independently processes its local data and is required to know only its direct neighbors. Extensive experiments using real-world OSN datasets show that DIVa is able to extract fine-grained community-aware correlations among profile attributes with average improvements up to 50\% than the global approach.},

Enabling communities to transition to a more resilient configuration of infrastructures is crucial for establishing a distributed portfolio of processes and systems by which human needs may be met. This paper proposes a potential way to increase infrastructure resilience by supporting the creation of alternative, decentralized infrastructures (ADIs) composed of small-scale, heterogeneous systems and processes. We see two possible roles for these ADIs: first, they could be integrated with existing infrastructures in the industrialized world, thereby providing some redundancy during times of strain on larger centralized systems; and second, they could help developing communities leapfrog centralized and more capital intensive conventional infrastructure. We present a model for how ADI systems may be built, based on principles from software engineering. Finally, we identify some challenges that go beyond technical implementation details in the instantiation of ADIs, and offer some thoughts on how to address them.},

 abstract = {Energy is the scarcest resource in ad hoc wireless networks, particularly in wireless sensor networks requiring a long lifetime. Intermittently switching the radio on and off is widely adopted as the most effective way to keep energy consumption low. This, however, prevents the very goal of communication, unless nodes switch their radios on at synchronized intervals—a rather nontrivial coordination task. In this article, we address the problem of synchronizing node radios to a single universal schedule in wireless mobile ad hoc networks that can potentially consist of thousands of nodes. More specifically, we are interested in operating the network with duty cycles that can be less than 1\% of the total cycle time. We identify the fundamental issues that govern cluster merging and provide a detailed comparison of various policies using extensive simulations based on a variety of mobility patterns. We propose a specific scheme that allows a 4,000-node network to stay synchronized with a duty cycle of approximately 0.7\%. Our work is based on an existing, experimental MAC protocol that we use for real-world applications and is validated in a real network of around 120 mobile nodes.},

 abstract = {Current applications, from complex sensor systems (e.g., quantified self) to online e-markets, acquire vast quantities of personal information that usually end up on central servers where they are exposed to prying eyes. Conversely, decentralized architectures that help individuals keep full control of their data complexify global treatments and queries, impeding the development of innovative services. This article aims precisely at reconciling individual's privacy on one side and global benefits for the community and business perspectives on the other. It promotes the idea of pushing the security to secure hardware devices controlling the data at the place of their acquisition. Thanks to these tangible physical elements of trust, secure distributed querying protocols can reestablish the capacity to perform global computations, such as Structured Query Language (SQL) aggregates, without revealing any sensitive information to central servers. This article studies how to secure the execution of such queries in the presence of honest-but-curious and malicious attackers. It also discusses how the resulting querying protocols can be integrated in a concrete decentralized architecture. Cost models and experiments on SQL/Asymmetric Architecture (AA), our distributed prototype running on real tamper-resistant hardware, demonstrate that this approach can scale to nationwide applications.},

 abstract = {In large-scale disaster scenarios, efficient triage management is a major challenge for emergency services. Rescue forces traditionally respond to such incidents with a paper-based triage system, but technical solutions can potentially achieve improved usability and data availability. We develop a triage management system based on commodity hardware and software components to verify this claim. We use a single-hop, ad-hoc network architecture with multi-master replication, a tablet-based device setup, and a mobile application for emergency services. We study our system in cooperation with regional emergency services and report on experiences from a field exercise. We show that state-of-the-art commodity technology provides the means necessary to implement a triage management system compatible with existing emergency service procedures, while introducing additional benefits. This work highlights that powerful real-world ad-hoc networking applications do not require unreasonable development effort, as existing tools from distributed systems, such as replicating NoSQL databases, can be used successfully.},

Even though it is the most efficient, central control requires fully automated connected vehicles, active vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, which introduces inherent security, privacy and feasibility issues. We simulate autonomous intelligent vehicles making local access decisions at isolated intersections, with only sensing and/or beacon information. The simulation proves to be collision-free. The extended management model is now able to account for various vehicle classes, all possible turns at the intersection and safe turning speeds.

@article{10.1145/3277668,
 abstract = {The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.},

 abstract = {The centralized nature of Software Defined Networking (SDN) provides the global view of the network topology at the SDN controller. Therefore, the controller should collect up-to-date information of network state, particularly its topology. Most of the current SDN controller platforms perform topology discovery using OpenFlow Discovery Protocol (OFDP) mechanism, which leverages (LLDP) the Link Layer Discovery Protocol. Unfortunately, the current topology discovery approach does not care about quality of service (QoS) information of underneath devices. But fortunately, QoS-aware topology discovery can be done with the same method, due to the structure of the LLDP packet. In this paper, we propose aggregated QoS-aware topology discovery mechanism, based on LLDP, over Decentralized Software Defined Wireless Mesh Network (D-SDWMN) architecture to collect and aggregate the topology and its corresponding QoS information, to support QoS-aware policies and decisions in SDN-based WMN. The experiment results present the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in term of QoS information collection with just slightly extra network traffic overhead, and without overall network traffic performance deteriorate.},

 abstract = {Running a sheer virtualized data center with the help of Virtual Machines (VM) is the de facto-standard in modern data centers. Live migration offers immense flexibility opportunities as it endows the system administrators with tools to seamlessly move VMs across physical machines. Several studies have shown that the resource utilization within a data center is not homogeneous across the physical servers. Load imbalance situations are observed where a significant portion of servers are either in overloaded or underloaded states. Apart from leading to inefficient usage of energy by underloaded servers, this might lead to serious QoS degradation issues in the overloaded servers.In this paper, we propose a lightweight decentralized solution for homogenizing the load across different machines in a data center. In search of better solutions, we have looked outside the field of computer science for inspiration. Inspired by Nobel Peace Prize winners Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley's work on Stable Matching [4], we borrow the concept of stable marriage matching problems where we pair pairs of underloaded servers and overloaded servers based on some notion of preferences for the purpose of homogenizing their load through exchange of VMs. Furthermore, our solution is distributed by accommodating this aspect in the original Stable Matching algorithm. We provide some real-life experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/3319535.3354253,
 abstract = {Many real-world social networks are decentralized in nature, and the only way to analyze such a network is to collect local views of the social graph from individual participants. Since local views may contain sensitive information, it is often desirable to apply differential privacy in the data collection process, which provides strong and rigorous privacy guarantees. In many practical situations, the local view of a participant contains not only her own connections, but also those of her neighbors, which are private and sensitive for the neighbors, but not directly so for the participant herself. We call such information beyond direct connections an extended local view (ELV)&lt;/&gt;, and study two fundamental problems related to ELVs: first, how do we correctly enforce differential privacy for all participants in the presence of ELVs? Second, how can the data collector utilize ELVs to obtain accurate estimates of global graph properties?This paper points out that when collecting ELVs, it is insufficient to apply a straightforward adaptation of local differential privacy (LDP)&lt;/&gt;, a commonly used scheme in practice, to protect the privacy of all network participants. The main problem is that an adversarial data collector can accumulate private information on a specific victim from multiple neighbors of the victim; even though the data collected from each neighbor is perturbed under LDP, their aggregate can still violate the victim's privacy. To prevent this attack, we formulate a novel decentralized differential privacy (DDP)&lt;/&gt; scheme, which requires that each participant consider not only her own privacy, but also that of her neighbors involved in her ELV.The stringent privacy requirement of DDP, however, makes it challenging to design an effective mechanism for data collection. Towards this goal, we design a novel multi-phase framework under DDP&lt;/&gt; that enables an analyst to accurately estimate subgraph counts, an important property of social graphs. The main idea is that instead of collecting subgraph counts directly, which would require excessively noise, the analyst first asks individuals about their respective minimum noise scale, which is private information since it depends on the local graph structure, and, thus, must be performed under DDP. For some types of subgraphs, this process is applied recursively&lt;/&gt;, i.e., the analyst asks about the necessary noise to be injected into the private information on the minimum local noise scale required to protect subgraph counts under DDP. As case studies, we instantiate the proposed framework for three common subgraph patterns: triangles, three-hop paths, and k&lt;/&gt;-cliques. Extensive experiments using real data demonstrate that the proposed scheme leads to accurate estimates of global subgraph counts, whereas baseline solutions fail to obtain meaningful result utility.},

Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach.

 abstract = {We present a novel scheme called Decentralized Attestation for Device Swarms (DADS), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to accomplish decentralized attestation in device swarms. Device swarms are smart, mobile, and interconnected devices that operate in large numbers and are likely to be part of emerging applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). Swarm devices process and exchange safety, privacy, and mission-critical information. Thus, it is important to have a good code verification technique that scales to device swarms and establishes trust among collaborating devices. DADS has several advantages over current state-of-the-art swarm attestation techniques: It is decentralized, has no single point of failure, and can handle changing topologies after nodes are compromised. DADS assures system resilience to node compromise/failure while guaranteeing only devices that execute genuine code remain part of the group. We conduct performance measurements of communication, computation, memory, and energy using the TrustLite embedded systems architecture in OMNeT++ simulation environment. We show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce communication cost and is very efficient in terms of computation, memory, and energy requirements. We also analyze security and show that DADS is very effective and robust against various attacks.},

 abstract = {We introduce two complementary approaches to monitor decentralized systems. The first approach relies on systems with a centralized specification, i.e., when the specification is written for the behavior of the entire system. To do so, our approach introduces a data structure that (i) keeps track of the execution of an automaton (ii) has predictable parameters and size, and (iii) guarantees strong eventual consistency. The second approach defines decentralized specifications wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system. We study two properties of decentralized specifications pertaining to monitorability and compatibility between specification and architecture. We also present a general algorithm for monitoring decentralized specifications. We map three existing algorithms to our approaches and provide a framework for analyzing their behavior. Furthermore, we present THEMIS, a framework for designing such decentralized algorithms and simulating their behavior. We demonstrate the usage of THEMIS to compare multiple algorithms and validate the trends predicted by the analysis in two scenarios: a synthetic benchmark and the Chiron user interface.},

A smart city is a system that connects groups of devices which produce and share a vast amount of information. Because of this large amount of data that travels between devices, there must be an organizational structure to organize and manage this movement. The basic characteristics of this system are transparent, decentralized, autonomy and immutable. All of these properties can be provided by BC Technology.

 abstract = {Distributed deep learning training usually adopts All-Reduce as the synchronization mechanism for data parallel algorithms due to its high performance in homogeneous environment. However, its performance is bounded by the slowest worker among all workers. For this reason, it is significantly slower in heterogeneous settings. AD-PSGD, a newly proposed synchronization method which provides numerically fast convergence and heterogeneity tolerance, suffers from deadlock issues and high synchronization overhead. Is it possible to get the best of both worlds --- designing a distributed training method that has both high performance like All-Reduce in homogeneous environment and good heterogeneity tolerance like AD-PSGD?In this paper, we propose Prague, a high-performance heterogeneity-aware asynchronous decentralized training approach. We achieve the above goal with intensive synchronization optimization by exploring the interplay between algorithm and system implementation, or statistical and hardware efficiency. To reduce synchronization cost, we propose a novel communication primitive, Partial All-Reduce, that enables fast synchronization among a group of workers. To reduce serialization cost, we propose static group scheduling in homogeneous environment and simple techniques, i.e., Group Buffer and Group Division, to largely eliminate conflicts with slightly reduced randomness. Our experiments show that in homogeneous environment, Prague is 1.2x faster than the state-of-the-art implementation of All-Reduce, 5.3x faster than Parameter Server and 3.7x faster than AD-PSGD. In a heterogeneous setting, Prague tolerates slowdowns well and achieves 4.4x speedup over All-Reduce.},

 abstract = {Token-based authentication is usually applied to enable single-sign-on on the web. In current authentication schemes, users are required to interact with identity providers securely to set up authentication data during a registration phase and receive a token (credential) for future accesses to various services and applications. This type of interaction can make authentication schemes challenging in terms of security and usability. From a security point of view, one of the main threats is the compromisation of identity providers. An adversary who compromises the authentication data (password or biometric) stored with the identity provider can mount an offline dictionary attack. Furthermore, the identity provider might be able to track user activity and control sensitive user data. In terms of usability, users always need a trusted server to be online and available while authenticating to a service provider.In this paper, we propose a new Decentralized Anonymous Multi-Factor Authentication (DAMFA) scheme where the process of user authentication no longer depends on a trusted third party (the identity provider). Also, service and identity providers do not gain access to sensitive user data and cannot track individual user activity. Our protocol allows service providers to authenticate users at any time without interacting with the identity provider.Our approach builds on a Threshold Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (TOPRF) to improve resistance to offline attacks and uses a distributed transaction ledger to improve usability. We demonstrate practicability of our proposed scheme through a prototype.},

 abstract = {As the number of personal computing and IoT devices grows rapidly, so does the amount of computational power that is available at the edge. Many of these devices are often idle and constitute an untapped resource which could be used for outsourcing computation. Existing solutions for harnessing this power, such as volunteer computing (e.g., BOINC), are centralized platforms in which a single organization or company can control participation and pricing. By contrast, an open market of computational resources, where resource owners and resource users trade directly with each other, could lead to greater participation and more competitive pricing. To provide an open market, we introduce MODiCuM, a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants from misbehaving---which is a key problem in decentralized systems---by resolving disputes via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since it does not require global trust in mediation results. We provide analytical results proving that MODiCuM can deter misbehavior, and we evaluate the overhead of MODiCuM using experimental results based on an implementation of our platform.},

However, most blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum) requires users to pay some fees to execute their desired actions in these novel online services. To which extent an increase in the price of such fees negatively affects user activity? Would significant price surges deter users from using blockchain-enabled online services? In this work, we study the 2020 surge of transaction fee price in the Ethereum network, and analyze how that affected user activities. Our use cases are the blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from the platforms DAOstack and DAOhaus. Thus, we analyzed 5,580 transactions from 7,825 users grouped in 191 DAO communities, using a VAR model with a daily time series of the average fee value and the DAO operations. Our results show just a minor influence of the fee (gas) price and the activity of DAO users. The insensitivity of the activity to the fee price is an anomaly in a supposedly self-regulated market, and we consider this should be tackled in future implementations.},

 abstract = {Today’s vehicles are examples of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) controlled by a large number of electronic control units (ECUs), which manage everything from heating to steering and braking. Due to the increasing complexity and inter-dependency of these units, it has become essential for an ECU to be able to ensure the integrity of the firmware running on other ECU’s to guarantee its own correct operation. Existing solutions for firmware attestation use a centralized approach, which means a single point of failure. In this article, we propose and investigate a decentralized firmware attestation scheme for the automotive domain. The basic idea of this scheme is that each ECU can attest to the state of those ECU’s on which it depends. Two flavors of ECU attestation, i.e., parallel and serial solution, were designed, implemented, and evaluated. The two variants were compared in terms of both detection performance (i.e., the ability to identify unauthorized firmware modifications) and timing performance. Our results show that the proposed scheme is feasible to implement and that the parallel solution showed a significant improvement in timing performance over the serial solution.},

 abstract = {With the end of Dennard scaling, power constraints have led to increasing compute specialization in the form of differently specialized accelerators integrated at various levels of the general-purpose system hierarchy. The result is that the most common general-purpose computing platform is now a heterogeneous mix of architectures even within a single die. Consequently, mapping application code regions into available execution engines has become a challenge due to different interfaces and increased software complexity. At the same time, the energy costs of data movement have become increasingly dominant relative to computation energy. This has inspired a move towards data-centric systems, where computation is brought to data, in contrast to traditional processing-centric models. However, enabling compute nearer memory entails its own challenges, including the interactions between distance-specialization and compute-specialization. The granularity of any offload to near(er) memory logic would impact the potential data transmission reduction, as smaller offloads will not be able to amortize the transmission costs of invocation and data return, while very large offloads can only be mapped onto logic that can support all of the necessary operations within kernel-scale codes, which exacerbates both area and power constraints. For better energy efficiency, each set of related operations should be mapped onto the execution engine that, among those capable of running the set of operations, best balances the data movement and the degree of compute specialization of that engine for this code. Further, this offload should proceed in a decentralized way that keeps both the data and control movement low for all transitions among engines and transmissions of operands and results. To enable such a decentralized offload model, we propose an architecture interface that enables a common offload model for accelerators across the memory hierarchy and a tool chain to automatically identify (in a distance-aware fashion) and map profitable code regions on specialized execution engines. We evaluate the proposed architecture for a wide range of workloads and show energy reduction compared to an energy-efficient in-order core. We also demonstrate better area efficiency compared to kernel-scale offloads.},

 abstract = {Decentralized algorithms, e.g., AllReduce, have been widely applied as the synchronization strategy for data-parallel distributed deep learning due to its superior performance over centralized ones. The synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approach guarantees accuracy for various deep learning models, but its performance suffers from stragglers, i.e., "long-tail effects." The straggler can be caused by the inherent load imbalance from workloads or system heterogeneity. Despite existing optimizations to support centralized algorithms against stragglers, little effort has been explored in decentralized training algorithms.This paper proposes a Randomized Non-blocking AllReduce (RNA) protocol to mitigate the straggler problem. To avoid "long-tail effects" brought by the strict barrier in the AllReduce, we propose a decentralized, relaxed, and randomized sampling approach to implement partial AllReduce operation. To handle heterogeneity at a large scale, we combine the traditional Parameter Servers (PS) with AllReduce to implement a hierarchical synchronization mechanism. We theoretically demonstrate the convergence analysis and detail the system implementation. The experiment results on representative deep learning models show nearly 1.8\texttimes{} speedup over the state-of-the-art Horovod and 1.3\texttimes{} speedup over AD-PSGD on a heterogeneous cluster.},

 abstract = {Clinical trials and drug discovery would not be effective without the collaboration of institutions. Earlier, it has been at the cost of individual’s privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant’s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the concept of in-place model training by keeping the data intact to the device. Though it is privacy-preserving in nature, however, it is susceptible to inference, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. Blockchain is a decentralized programming paradigm that provides a broader control of the system, making it attack resistant. It poses challenges of high computing power, storage, and latency. These emerging technologies can contribute to the desired learning system and motivate them to address their security and efficiency issues. This article systematizes the security issues in Federated Learning, its corresponding mitigation strategies, and Blockchain’s challenges. Further, a Blockchain-based Federated Learning architecture with two layers of participation is presented, which improves the global model accuracy and guarantees participant’s privacy. It leverages the channel mechanism of Blockchain for parallel model training and distribution. It facilitates establishing decentralized trust between the participants and the gateways using the Blockchain, which helps to have only honest participants.},

 abstract = {Urban Air Mobility, the scenario where hundreds of manned and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) carry out a wide variety of missions (e.g., moving humans and goods within the city), is gaining acceptance as a transportation solution of the future. One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed online. We propose Learning-‘N-Flying (LNF), a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance (CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on the fly, and allows autonomous Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)s managed by different operators to safely carry out complex missions, represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for two UASs as a mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online. Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining (1) learning-based decision-making and (2) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF extends L2F to cases where there are more than two UASs on a collision path. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online (computation time in the order of milliseconds) and under certain assumptions has failure rates of less than 1\% in the worst case, improving to near 0\% in more relaxed operations. We show the applicability of our scheme to a wide variety of settings through multiple case studies.},

 abstract = {In an effort to contain the Covid-19 pandemic emergency, nations have sponsored smartphones apps tracing contacts. The ultimate aim is to alert people when a Covid-19-positive has been found and it occurs that they have been in close contact with the positive. In the context of contact tracing, transparency of data gathered is of utmost importance to show beyond doubt that the people privacy is preserved as much as possible. The proposed approach aims at making gathered data publicly available in such a way that anonymity is preserved and stored data are immutable and not owned by a single organization. For this, we equip users in a university environment with an app that reveals their presence as a proximity to a WiFi access point. While the server-side provides location ids to apps, the location history is kept within the app and checks for a possible contact are performed by the app. The server aggregates presence data related to each WiFi access point according to time-slots, and stores these periodically in a blockchain for maximum transparency and immutability. The tests on the developed prototype have shown the accuracy in determining presence data, the feasibility for apps to interact with smart contracts and to have daily presence data stored in a blockchain. The ability to exhibit official and immutable statistics on people gathering at university should be useful to give evidence of the effort to have controlled accesses and gathering avoidance.},

 abstract = {Machine learning has become ubiquitous across many fields in the last decade and modern real world applications often require a decentralized solution for training such models. This demand sprouted the research in federated learning, which solves some of the challenges with centralized machine learning, but at the same times raises further questions in regard to security, privacy and scalability. We have designed and implemented DecFL, an ubiquitous protocol for decentralized model training. The protocol is machine-learning-model-, vendor-, and technology-agnostic and provides a basis for practitioner's own implementations. The implemented DecFL framework presented in this article is an exemplary realization of the carefully designed protocol stack based on Ethereum and IPFS and offers a scalable baseline solution for decentralized machine learning. In this article, we present a study based on the proposed protocol, its theoretical bounds and experiments based on the implemented framework. Using open-source datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10), we demonstrate key features, the actual cost of training a model (in euro) and the communication overhead. We further show that through a proper choice of technologies DecFL achieves a linear scaling, which is a non-trivial task in a decentralized setting. Along with discussing some of the security challenges in the field, we highlight aggregation poisoning as a relevant attack vector, its associated risks and a possible prevention strategy for decentralized model training through DecFL.},

Unfortunately, existing blockchain event frameworks are immature, syntactic, inflexible and not expressive enough for many application needs.In this paper, we propose an approach that involves an event model which "semantifies blockchain transactions" and an implementation architecture that integrates a open-source blockchain database BigChainDB with a semantic engine and publish-subscribe messaging platform. Finally, we model and simulate a use-case inspired from the manufacturing domain and present usability and preliminary performance results that demonstrate the discriminatory ability of semantics-enabled event model.},

This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain’s novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.},

 abstract = {The ongoing industrialization and rising technology adoption around the world are leading to ever higher energy consumption. The benefits of electrification are enormous, but the growing demand also comes with challenges with respect to associated greenhouse gas emissions. Although continuing progress in energy research has brought up new technologies in energy generation, storage, and distribution, most of those technologies focus on increasing efficiency of individual components. Work on integration and coordination abilities between individual components in micro-grids will lead to further improvements and gains in efficiency that are necessary to reduce carbon footprints and slow down climate change. To this end, the CityLearn environment provides a simulation framework that allows the control of energy components in buildings that are organized in districts. In this paper, we propose an energy management system based on the decentralized actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm MARLISA but integrate a centralized critic and call it MARLISADSCC. In this way, we are training a model to autonomously control the energy storage of individual buildings in a CityLearn district to improve demand response guided by a better informed training signal. We show performance increases over baseline control techniques for a district but also discuss the resulting action selection for individual buildings.},

The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation and built cryptographically secure blockchain-based infrastructure to counter this threat. Now, not just on chain transactions are being tracked but every move of participants in blockchain communities. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if mis-used for social control. This piece analyzes the ways in which decentralization efforts can be a threat to themselves by exploring the question, 'Are "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) the next panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in "autonomous" systems?'. By employing ethnographic methods and case study analysis, this piece provides an important qualitative contribution to the early dynamics of the aspirations and problems of decentralized, autonomous organizations.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, Online Social Media (OSM) are among the most popular web services. Traditional OSM are known to be affected by serious issues including misinformation, fake news, censorship, and privacy violations, to the point that a pressing demand for new paradigms is raised by users all over the world. Among such paradigms, the concepts around the Web 3.0 are fueling a new revolution of online sociality, pushing towards the adoption of innovative and groundbreaking technologies. In particular, the decentralization of social services through the blockchain technology is representing the most valid alternative to current OSM, enabling the development of rewarding strategies for value redistribution, and fake news detection. However, the so-called Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSMs) are far from being mature, with different platforms that continually try to redefine their services in order to attract larger audiences, thus causing blockchain forks and massive user migrations, with the latter dominating the dynamics of the current OSM landscape, too. In this paper, we deal with the evolution of BOSMs from the perspective of user migration across platforms as a consequence of a fork event. We propose a general user migration model applicable to BOSMs to represent the evolution patterns of fork-based migrations, the multi-interaction structural complexity of BOSMs, and their growth characteristics. Within this framework, we also cope with the task of predicting how users will behave in the case of a fork, i.e. they will remain on the original blockchain or they will migrate to the new one. We apply our framework to the case study of the Steem-Hive fork event, and show the importance of considering both social and economic information, regardless of the learning algorithm considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on blockchain fork and its related user migration.},

We are particularly interested in applying the coordination languages to decentralized systems. To this end, blockchain smart contracts are proposed to offer a decentralized trustable method to automatically verify compliance with pre-defined conditions before executing a transaction involving multiple parties.

@inproceedings{10.1145/3510003.3510086,
 abstract = {Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications.In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we evaluated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.},

 abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

 abstract = {The paper discusses the influence exerted by financial systems on the change of the financial sector and its further development. The study is relevant since there is need for building up more trust in blockchain. In the course of the research, the main trends of decentralized financial systems were identified and presented, including the problems related to decentralized financial systems and options for resolving them. The study is aimed at defining the problems and searching for ways to tackle them when regulating decentralized finances (DeFi) in order to ensure effective regulation on the part of the Central Bank and control risks. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, DeFi, in fact, has to be regulated so as to achieve its main decentralization goal. In addition, DeFi presents a potential possibility for developing a fairly new regulation method: the idea of “integrated regulation”. The paper considers various approaches to regulation, which can be integrated in the DeFi design. It can potentially lead to the decentralization of both finance and its regulation, which eventually expresses RegTech (Regulatory Technology), which is used by financial organizations for being able to meet the requirements of the regulator more easily. The study defines the problems that are encountered in the course of using DeFi and points out the possible ways for dealing with them, including a way for switching to blockchain independently so that the transaction is not charged in ETH for calculation on blockchain; reducing the complexity and costs of use and understanding of DeFi software by most users. A whole lot of risks that decentralized financial protocols are susceptible to is analyzed: vulnerabilities in the code security of smart contracts, their stacking and layout; oracle risk, which is subject to manipulation in the process of data transfer; the financial risk of high volatility, regulatory risk and crisis of the global economy due to the inability to predict in which way the Covid-19 pandemic is going to be resolved.},

 abstract = {Many scientific and practical areas have shown increasing interest in reaping the benefits of blockchain technology to empower software systems. However, the unique characteristics and requirements associated with Blockchain-based Software (BBS) systems raise new challenges across the development lifecycle that entail an extensive improvement of conventional software engineering. This article presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art in BBS engineering research from the perspective of the software engineering discipline. We characterize BBS engineering based on the key aspects of theoretical foundations, processes, models, and roles. Based on these aspects, we present a rich repertoire of development tasks, design principles, models, roles, challenges, and resolution techniques. The focus and depth of this survey not only give software engineering practitioners and researchers a consolidated body of knowledge about current BBS development but also underpin a starting point for further research in this field.},

 abstract = {In this work, we investigate the application of a multi-objective genetic algorithm to the problem of task allocation in a self-organizing, decentralized, threshold-based swarm. We use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to evolve response thresholds for a simulated swarm engaged in dynamic task allocation problems: two-dimensional and three-dimensional collective tracking. We show that evolved thresholds not only outperform uniformly distributed thresholds and dynamic thresholds but achieve nearly optimal performance on a variety of tracking problem instances (target paths). More importantly, we demonstrate that thresholds evolved for some problem instances generalize to all other problem instances, eliminating the need to evolve new thresholds for each problem instance to be solved. We analyze the properties that allow these paths to serve as universal training instances and show that they are quite natural.After a priori evolution, the response thresholds in our system are static. The problem instances solved by the swarms are highly dynamic, with schedules of task demands that change over time with significant differences in rate and magnitude of change. That the swarm is able to achieve nearly optimal results refutes the common assumption that a swarm must be dynamic to perform well in a dynamic environment.},

 abstract = {We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks — and, thereby, DeFi protocols — would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.},

 abstract = {As an alternative to Twitter and other centralized social networks, the Fediverse is growing in popularity. The recent, and polemical, takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk has exacerbated this trend. The Fediverse includes a growing number of decentralized social networks, such as Pleroma or Mastodon, that share the same subscription protocol (ActivityPub). Each of these decentralized social networks is composed of independent instances that are run by different administrators. Users, however, can interact with other users across the Fediverse regardless of the instance they are signed up to. The growing user base of the Fediverse creates key challenges for the administrators, who may experience a growing burden. In this paper, we explore how large that overhead is, and whether there are solutions to alleviate the burden. We study the overhead of moderation on the administrators. We observe a diversity of administrator strategies, with evidence that administrators on larger instances struggle to find sufficient resources. We then propose a tool, WatchGen, to semi-automate the process.},

For example, the majority of web traffic now originates from a few organizations, and even micro-websites often choose to host on large pre-existing cloud infrastructures. In response to this, the "Decentralized Web" attempts to distribute ownership and operation of web services more evenly. This paper describes the design and implementation of the largest and most widely used Decentralized Web platform --- the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) --- an open-source, content-addressable peer-to-peer network that provides distributed data storage and delivery. IPFS has millions of daily content retrievals and already underpins dozens of third-party applications. This paper evaluates the performance of IPFS by introducing a set of measurement methodologies that allow us to uncover the characteristics of peers in the IPFS network. We reveal presence in more than 2700 Autonomous Systems and 152 countries, the majority of which operate outside large central cloud providers like Amazon or Azure. We further evaluate IPFS performance, showing that both publication and retrieval delays are acceptable for a wide range of use cases. Finally, we share our datasets, experiences and lessons learned.},

The Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) is widely used in blockchains, e.g., Libra/Diem; however, no suitable threshold solution exists. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a threshold EdDSA that allows n parties to generate keys in a decentralized and distributed manner. Any t + 1-of-n parties can generate standard EdDSA signatures. This scheme supports an arbitrary threshold (t, n) and has been proven to be secure against at most t malicious adversaries. The theoretical analysis (computation complexity and communication footprints) and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs efficiently on cloud servers and embedded devices. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is integrated with Tendermint, a blockchain framework that uses EdDSA, to generate keys and sign transactions in a decentralized manner, which indicates that this scheme is compatible with blockchains for supporting DeFi applications.},

 abstract = {The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

 abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) or blockchains have been steadily emerging and providing innovation in the past decade for several use cases, ranging from financial networks, to notarization, or trustworthy execution via smart contracts. DLTs are enticing due to their properties of decentralization, non-repudiation, and auditability (transparency). These properties are of high potential to access control systems that can be implemented on-chain, and are executed without infringement and full transparency.While it remains uncertain which use cases will truly turn out to be viable, many use cases such as financial transactions can benefit from integrating certain restrictions via access control on the blockchain. In addition, smart contracts may in the future present security risks that are currently yet unknown. As a solution, access control policies can provide flexibility in the execution flow when adopted by smart contracts.In this paper, we present our DEDACS architecture which provides decentralized and dynamic access control for smart contracts in a policy-based manner. Our access control is expressive as it features policies, and dynamic as the environment or users can be changed, or alternative policies can be assigned to smart contracts. DEDACS ensures that our access control preserves the desired properties of decentralization and transparency, while aiming to keep the costs involved as minimal as possible. We have evaluated DEDACS in the context of a Uniswap token-exchange platform, in which we evaluated the costs related to (i) the introduced overhead at deployment time and (ii) the operational overhead cost. DEDACS introduces a relative overhead of on average 52\% at deployment time, and an operational overhead between 52\% and 80\% depending on the chosen policy and its complexity.},

 abstract = {In this paper, decentralized scheduling for a cognitive multihop underwater acoustic network with a primary user interference constraint is investigated. The network consists of primary and secondary users, with multihop transmission adopted for both user types to provide reliable communications. Key characteristics of underwater acoustic channels, including large propagation delay, distance-and-frequency dependent attenuation, half-duplex modem and inter-hop interference are taken into account in the design and analysis. In particular, time-slot allocation is found to be more effective than frequency-slot allocation due to distinct features of the underwater channel. The goal of the network scheduling problem is to maximize the end-to-end throughput of the overall system, while limiting the throughput loss of primary users. The framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDP) is applied to formulate the optimization problem, with a computationally intractable optimal solution. Key properties are shown for the objective function, enabling the design of approximate schemes with significant complexity reduction. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly increases system throughput while maintaining the primary throughput loss constraint. Under certain traffic conditions, the throughput gain over frequency-slot allocation schemes can be as high as .},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

 abstract = {Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many challenging issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, in which a trustworthy central authority is needed for coordination. Such an approach incurs many disadvantages, including vulnerability to attacks, lack of credibility, and difficulty in calculating rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the abovementioned issues. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods, and techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work comprehensively surveys challenges, solutions, and future directions for blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes: decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed, and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.},

 abstract = {Resource reservation is a fundamental mechanism for ensuring quality of service in time-sensitive networks, which can be decentralized by using reservation protocols. In the Ethernet technology Time-Sensitive Networking, this has been proposed in conjunction with the Credit-Based Shaper. For the reservation, the standards assume a maximum worst-case latency bound at each hop. However, we will show through formal analysis and simulation that these worst-case latency bounds are not safe. To face this, we propose an extension to the current standards to allow the reservation of time-sensitive traffic with reliable latency guarantees. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations of both synthetic and industrial networks. Finally, by providing additional information about neighboring devices, we could further increase the maximum reservable traffic by up to 20\% in our test cases.},

 abstract = {Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model.},

Timed commitments ensure that the auction is finalized fairly even if all participants drop out after posting bids or if n bidders collude to try to learn the nth bidder's bid value. Our protocols rely on a novel non-malleable timed commitment scheme which efficiently supports range proofs to establish that bidders have sufficient funds to cover a hidden bid value. This allows us to penalize users who abandon bids for exactly the bid value, while supporting simultaneous bidding in multiple auctions with a shared collateral pool. Our protocols are concretely efficient and we have implemented them in an Ethereum-compatible smart contract which automatically enforces payment and delivery of an auctioned digital asset.},

 abstract = {Public auditing and data deduplication are integral considerations in providing efficient and secure cloud storage services. Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

 abstract = {In recent years, machine learning models have evolved, and the training of these models requires large amounts of data. However, the training data often contains sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. Federated Learning has been proposed as a solution to mitigate privacy risks. Despite its advantages, Federated Learning still faces challenges such as the aggregator being a single point of failure, the existence of malicious participants, and the lack of incentives. Combining Federated Learning with blockchain technology could potentially address these challenges. In this study, we propose a new method for asynchronous Federated Learning using blockchain smart contracts. Our proposed method operates autonomously and in a decentralized manner without the need to trust any central organization, making it trustless. We propose an algorithm that motivates workers to submit high-quality models as quickly as possible. Workers’ behaviors are driven by incentive mechanisms. We deployed a smart contract on a local Ethereum blockchain and executed multiple workers. Our evaluation results demonstrate that learning converges and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional Federated Learning, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

We consider the problem of improving the throughput of a scaled model of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge: a two-stage bottleneck where four lanes reduce to two and then reduce to one. Although there is extensive work examining variants of bottleneck control in a centralized setting, there is less study of the challenging multi-agent setting where the large number of interacting AVs leads to significant optimization difficulties for reinforcement learning methods. We apply multi-agent reinforcement algorithms to this problem and demonstrate that significant improvements in bottleneck throughput, from 20\% at a 5\% penetration rate to 33\% at a 40\% penetration rate, can be achieved. We compare our results to a hand-designed feedback controller and demonstrate that our results sharply outperform the feedback controller despite extensive tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RL-based controllers adopt a robust strategy that works across penetration rates whereas the feedback controllers degrade immediately upon penetration rate variation. We investigate the feasibility of both action and observation decentralization and demonstrate that effective strategies are possible using purely local sensing.

However, some dislocated areas are underprivileged in providing such services due to the lack, inefficiency, or excessive cost of Internet access. Opportunistic networking techniques might aid in surmounting these problems. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on an untrusted Data Mule to carry data from an offline source to an online destination. In particular, we present a framework that enables the communication between different actors and a reward mechanism using Distributed Ledger Technologies, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized File Storage. The protocol involved in bringing a Client’s message online and getting back a response is thoroughly explained in all its steps and then discussed on the most important trust and security issues. Finally, we evaluate such a protocol and the whole framework through a series of communication latency tests, an analysis of the Smart Contract usage, and simulations in which buses act as Data Mules. Our results suggest the feasibility of our proposal in a smart territory scenario.},

 abstract = {Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) systems have been widely adopted in highly scalable environments. We see this especially with IoT/IIoT applications, an environment where low bandwidth and high latency is ideal. The projected growth of Iot/IIoT network nodes are in the billions in the next few years and as such, there is a need for network communication standards that can adapt to the evergrowing nature of this industry. While current pub/sub standards have produced positive results so far, they all adopt a "topic" based pub/sub approach. They do not leverage off modern devices having spatial information. Current open-source standards also focus heavily on centralized brokering of information. This makes the broker in this system a potential bottleneck as it means if that broker goes down, the entire network goes down. We have developed a new, unique and innovative open-source pub/sub standard called VAST that leverages spatial information of modern network devices to perform message communication. It uses a unique concept called Spatial Publish/Subscribe (SPS). It is built on a peer-to-peer network to enable high scalability. In addition to this, it provides a Voronoi Overlay to efficiently distribute the messages, ensuring that network brokers are not overloaded with requests and ensures the network self-organizes itself if one or more brokers break down. It also has a forwarding algorithm to eliminate redundancies in the network. We will demonstrate this concept with a simulator we developed. We will show how the simulator works and how to use it. We believe that with this simulator, we will help encourage researchers adopt this technology for their spatial applications. An example of such is Massively Multi-user Virtual Environments (MMVEs), where there is a need for a high number of spatial network nodes in virtual environments.},

This paper introduces IDEA-DAC a paradigm shift from the conventional revoke-and-reissue methods, promoting direct and Integrity-Driven Editing (IDE) for Accountable DACs, which results in better integrity accountability, traceability, and system simplicity. We further incorporate an Edit-bound Conformity Check that ensures tailored integrity standards during credential amendments using R1CS-based ZK-SNARKs. Delving deeper, we propose ZK-JSON, a unique R1CS circuit design tailored for IDE over generic JSON documents. This design imposes strictly O(N) rank-1 constraints for variable-length JSON documents of up to N bytes in length, encompassing serialization, encryption, and edit-bound conformity checks. Additionally, our circuits only necessitate a one-time compilation, setup, and smart contract deployment for homogeneous JSON documents up to a specified size. While preserving core DAC features such as selective disclosure, anonymity, and predicate provability, IDEA-DAC achieves precise data modification checks without revealing private content, ensuring only authorized edits are permitted. In summary, IDEA-DAC offers an enhanced methodology for large-scale JSON-formatted credential systems, setting a new standard in decentralized identity management efficiency and precision.},

In particular, whenever the communication graph changes, the Metropolis-Hastings method [69] is applied to update the weighted adjacency matrix based on the current communication topology. In addition, the Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) scheme [61] is integrated to facilitate privacy in reaching consensus of the global model.

Data Theft, Flooding, Fuzzing, Hijacking, Malware Spoofing and Advanced Persistent Threats have been immensely growing attack that leads to end-user conflict by abolishing trust on autonomous vehicle. Looking after those sensitive data that contributes to measure the localisation factors of the vehicle, conventional centralised techniques can be misused to update the legitimate vehicular status maliciously. As investigated, the existing centralized false data detection approach based on state and likelihood estimation has a reprehensible trade-off in terms of accuracy, trust, cost, and efficiency. Blockchain with Fuzzy-logic Intelligence has shown its potential to solve localisation issues, trust and false data detection challenges encountered by today’s autonomous vehicular system. The proposed Blockchain-based fuzzy solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and reputation preservation technique. The illustrated proposed model filters false and anomalous data based on the vehicles’ rules and behaviours. Besides improving the detection accuracy and eliminating the single point of failure, the contributions include appropriating fuzzy AI functions within the Road-side Unit node before authorizing status data by a Blockchain network.

 abstract = {Remote voting has become more critical in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. Blockchain technology and its benefits such as decentralization, security, and transparency have given rise to proposals for blockchain-based voting systems. However, the traceability of blockchain transactions violates voter anonymity in existing proposals. Besides, transaction costs also need to be considered. Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89\% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at .},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology (BCT) has garnered a great deal of attention and interest due to its cutting-edge, revolutionary, and promising features. The concept of blockchain involves linking a series of transaction blocks together in a chain, with each block being encrypted and inaccessible to anyone who lacks unanimous agreement. BC is comprised of five core stages, but the focus of this paper is on BC 2.0, specifically smart contracts. Smart contracts are utilized to ensure appropriate access controls and the enforcement of contracts. Digital signatures are essential for transactions in smart contracts, and various signature algorithms are employed, including ECDSA and EdDSA. The research problem is to compare and contrast the levels of security offered by two digital signature algorithms, ECDSA and EdDSA, which are employed in smart contracts. The primary objective of this study is to determine which digital signature algorithm performs better in terms of security.},

 abstract = {Volunteer moderators serve as gatekeepers for problematic content, such as racism and other forms of hate speech, on digital platforms. Prior studies have reported volunteer moderators' diverse roles in different governance models, highlighting the tensions between moderators and other stakeholders (e.g., administrative teams and users). Building upon prior research, this paper focuses on how volunteer moderators moderate racist content and how a platform's governance influences these practices. To understand how moderators deal with racist content, we conducted in-depth interviews with 13 moderators from city subreddits on Reddit. We found that moderators heavily relied on AutoMod to regulate racist content and racist user accounts. However, content that was crafted through covert racism and "color-blind'' racial frames was not addressed well. We attributed these challenges in moderating racist content to (1) moderators' concerns of power corruption, (2) arbitrary moderator team structures, and (3) evolving forms of covert racism. Our results demonstrate that decentralized governance on Reddit could not support local efforts to regulate color-blind racism. Finally, we discuss the conceptual and practical ways to disrupt color-blind moderation.},

 abstract = {Key management has long remained a difficult unsolved problem in the field of usable security. While password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) are widely used to solve this problem in centralized applications, their low entropy and lack of a recovery mechanism make them unsuitable for use in decentralized contexts. The multi-factor key derivation function (MFKDF) is a recently proposed cryptographic primitive that aims to address these deficiencies by incorporating commonly used authentication factors into the key derivation process. In this paper, we implement an MFKDF-based Ethereum wallet and perform a user study with 27 participants to directly compare its usability against traditional cryptocurrency wallet architectures. Our results show that MFKDF-based applications outperform conventional key management approaches on both subjective and objective metrics, with a 37\% higher average SUS score (p &lt; 0.0001) and 71\% faster task completion times (p &lt; 0.0001) for the MFKDF-based wallet.},

 abstract = {Decentralized identity (DID), the idea of giving users complete control over their identity-related data, is being used to solve the privacy tension in the identity management of decentralized applications (Dapps). While existing approaches do an excellent job of solving the privacy tension, they have not adequately addressed the accountability and Sybil-resistance issues. Moreover, these approaches have a considerable gas overhead, making them impractical for Dapps. We presented Hades, a novel practical DID system supporting full accountability and fine-grained Sybil-resistance while providing strong privacy properties. Hades supports three aspects of accountability, i.e., auditability, traceability, and revocation. Hades is the first DID system that supports accountability in all these three aspects. Hades is also the first DID system that supports fine-grained Sybil-resistance, enabling Dapps to customize personalized Sybil resistance strategies based on users’ identity attributes. Hades can run efficiently on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We implemented and evaluated Hades. The benchmarks showed that Hades has the lowest gas cost incurred on EVM as far as we know. Also, we presented a case study on attribute-associated fair NFT distribution (“airdrops”) where all previous works failed, whereas we gave a solution leveraging Hades.},

Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

 abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are decentralized digital tokens to represent the unique ownership of items. Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

 abstract = {User migration, i.e. the movement of large sets of users from one online social platform to another one, is one of the main phenomena occurring in modern online social networks and even involves the most recent alternative paradigms of online social networks, such as blockchain online social networks (BOSNs). In these platforms, user migration mainly occurs through hard forks of the supporting blockchain, i.e. a split of the original blockchain and the creation of an alternative blockchain, to which users may decide to migrate. However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

In order to accomplish this, the proposed solution is anchored in the self-sovereign identity (SSI) paradigm, which embodies a distributed identity management system. By adopting this paradigm, we obviate slow cryptographic premises such as identity-based encryption (IBE) that were used in prior work. Furthermore, we enhance the existing verifiable credentials (VCs) from this paradigm by introducing our own decentralized permission objects to support the concept of transitive delegations. This concept allows delegates to further delegate their access to resources with the same or fewer privileges to other entities within the framework. This renders our solution suitable for diverse scenarios, including applications in decentralized building access management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of transitive delegations in this paradigm. Finally, our performance experiments show a performance enhancement of three orders of magnitude compared to the prevailing state-of-the-art solutions.},

The increasing number of vehicles has made the vehicular network diverse, dynamic, and large-scale, making it difficult to meet the 5G network’s demanding requirements. Decentralized systems are interesting and provide attractive services because they are publicly available (transparency), have an append-only ledger (robust integrity protection), remove single points of failure, and enable distributed key management and communication in a peer-to-peer network. Researchers dedicated substantial efforts to advancing vehicle communications, however conventional cryptographic mechanisms are insufficient which enabled us to look at decentralized technologies. Therefore, we revisit decentralized approaches with VANETs. Endpoint devices hold a wallet which may incorporate threshold key management methods like MPC wallets, HD Wallets, or multi-party threshold ECDSA/EdDSA/BLS. We also discuss trust management approaches and demonstrate how decentralization can improve integrity, security, privacy, and resilience to single points of failure. We also conduct a comprehensive review, comparing them with current requirements, and the latest authentication and secure communication architectures, which require the involvement of trusted but non-transparent authorities in certificate issuance/revocation. We highlight the limitations of these schemes from PKI deployment and recommend future research, particularly in the realm of quantum cryptography.},

More specifically, this article introduces a general modular blockchain analytic framework that decomposes a blockchain system into interacting modules and then examines the major modules to cover the essential blockchain components of network, consensus, and distributed ledger at the micro-level. The framework as well as the modular analysis jointly build a foundation for designing scalable, flexible, and application-adaptive blockchains that can meet diverse requirements.

 abstract = {Society is characterized by the presence of a variety of social norms: collective patterns of sanctioning that can prevent miscoordination and free-riding. Inspired by this, we aim to construct learning dynamics where potentially beneficial social norms can emerge. Since social norms are underpinned by sanctioning, we introduce a training regime where agents can access all sanctioning events but learning is otherwise decentralized. This setting is technologically interesting because sanctioning events may be the only available public signal in decentralized multi-agent systems where reward or policy-sharing is infeasible or undesirable. To achieve collective action in this setting, we construct an agent architecture containing a classifier module that categorizes observed behaviors as approved or disapproved, and a motivation to punish in accord with the group. We show that social norms emerge in multi-agent systems containing this agent and investigate the conditions under which this helps them achieve socially beneficial outcomes.},

 abstract = {The increasing size of both deep learning models and training data necessitates the ability to scale out model training through pipeline-parallel training, which combines pipelined model parallelism and data parallelism. However, most of them assume an ideal homogeneous dedicated cluster. As for real cloud clusters, these approaches suffer from the intensive model synchronization overheads due to the dynamic environment heterogeneity. Such a huge challenge leaves the design in a dilemma: either the performance bottleneck of the central parameter server (PS) or severe performance degradation caused by stragglers for decentralized synchronization (like All-Reduce). This approach presents SDPipe, a new semi-decentralized framework to get the best of both worlds, achieving both high heterogeneity tolerance and convergence efficiency in pipeline-parallel training. To provide high performance, we decentralize the communication model synchronization, which accounts for the largest proportion of synchronization overhead. In contrast, we centralize the process of group scheduling, which is lightweight but needs a global view for better performance and convergence speed against heterogeneity. We show via a prototype implementation the significant advantage of SDPipe on performance and scalability, facing different environments.},

 abstract = {The ability to decentralize knowledge graphs (KG) is important to exploit the full potential of the Semantic Web and realize the Web 3.0 vision. However, decentralization also renders KGs more prone to attacks with adverse effects on data integrity and query verifiability. While existing studies focus on ensuring data integrity, how to ensure query verifiability - thus guarding against incorrect, incomplete, or outdated query results - remains unsolved. We propose VeriDKG, the first SPARQL query engine for decentralized knowledge graphs (DKG) that offers both data integrity and query verifiability guarantees. The core of VeriDKG is the RGB-Trie, a new blockchain-maintained authenticated data structure (ADS) facilitating correctness proofs for SPARQL query results. VeriDKG enables verifiability of subqueries by gathering global index information on subgraphs using the RGB-Trie, which is implemented as a new variant of the Merkle prefix tree with an RGB color model. To enable verifiability of the final query result, the RGB-Trie is integrated with a cryptographic accumulator to support verifiable aggregation operations. A rigorous analysis of query verifiability in VeriDKG is presented, along with evidence from an extensive experimental study demonstrating its state-of-the-art query performance on the largeRDFbench benchmark.},

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

It can minimize the contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, and other issues in corporate governance. However, DAOs also face a variety of governance issues, such as internal governance issues and external governance issues caused by the technical attributes of blockchain and smart contracts. DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions. We consider that parallel governance represents the future trend of DAO research and practice.

This trend will likely impact other related industries and their business model such as automotive insurance companies, tier-II automotive manufactures, and automotive maintenance service companies. The growing number of connected vehicles will require new policy formulation by the government about privacy and security issues in the era of massive digitalization and automation. Organizations such as 3GPP and IEEE are evolving standards that address security issues for connected vehicles. However, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will play a significant role in 5G networks and beyond, we address the privacy and security issues with a blockchain-based intelligent digital forensics system for autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) in a connected smart world incorporating artificial intelligence. The proposed system includes a novel algorithm for the autonomous connected vehicles and the users' security and privacy. We utilize short randomizable signatures to anonymously authenticate witness's identities and to protect the witnesses' privacy. Then, we leverage fine-grained access control based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for evidence access and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system by simulating the proposed model, its computational costs and communication overhead by implementing a prototype on a local Ethereum blockchain network platform. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed system. We envision the application of the proposed system to ensure security and privacy of ACVs and their security applications for use with 5G-V2X and future XG-V2X networks.},

Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data.

 abstract = {As the application of Blockchain Technology (BCT) grows across several industries, its inherent decentralized and immutable nature raises some conflicting issues concerning privacy regulation. The enforcement of privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) exemplifies these challenges, as certain stringent privacy requirements within GDPR may conflict with BCT's features. However, little attention is given to such critical issues. This study draws on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theoretical lens as a mechanism to unfold the issue. The current research focuses on exploring the tensions and the opportunities for synergy through the lens of TOE to prevent privacy regulatory compliance failure. We analyzed 71 multidisciplinary research studies that highlight the areas of friction and present a unifying structure for research synthesis. In response to the identified areas of friction and potential opportunities for coexistence, we formulate nine research propositions centered around six prominent and contentious data privacy and protection requirements within the GDPR. This research contributes to the broader discourse on privacy regulatory-compliant blockchain-based solutions by providing a theoretical foundation for future investigation into this critical area. The study suggests that reconciling BCT and privacy regulation requirements will unlock BCT's full potential, creating a secure, privacy-conscious technology infrastructure and offering practical implications and insights for policymakers.},

A control center, prosumers, and service operators constitute the model’s multi-layered architecture.

Smart contracts enable prosumers to trade energy units in the Ethereum blockchain with ease via a participatory web platform. The effectiveness of the framework in synchronizing power supply and demand within the VPP by coordinating the charging and discharging of storage systems in accordance with consumption patterns is demonstrated through performance evaluation. In contrast to conventional centralized architectures, the proposed framework utilized decentralized architecture efficiently consolidates and optimizes distributed energy resources (DERs) to improve grid stability and renewable energy utilization.},

 abstract = {Presently, majority of car-pooling services depend on a central third party which makes these platforms susceptible to data privacy, security concerns, and a single point of failure. Moreover, drivers and passengers are charged with different services fees by the electric mobility service provider. The emergence of emerging technologies such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can foster trust, boost electric car-pooling business models. Hence, DLT is utilized to store electric car-pooling trips, drivers, and passengers’ information to ensure user privacy and maintain security. Similarly, social practice theories such as Community of Practice (CoP) is progressively considered as a significant structure within societies as it aids the development and sharing of resources across groups. But very little attention has been devoted to examined how CoP can be employed to support the design of decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling. Leveraging CoP and DLT, this paper proposes a decentralized community of practice-based model that enables drivers to publish electric car-pooling services and passengers to be matched to a driver without depending on a trusted third party. A systematic literature review was adopted to collect data and a case study of a decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling was presented. Findings from this study highlights conceptualization of CoP for improving decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling and provide insights on efficient decentralized mechanisms for electric car-pooling. Theoretically, this article identifies the current problems, state-of-the-art of decentralized electric car-pooling. For policy implications this study provides guidelines to effectively govern and manage the development of on-demand electric car-pooling for sustainable public transportation.},

 abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.},

 abstract = {The impacts of climate change are predicted to negatively impair the improvements made towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), especially in developing countries. Uncertainty on specific actions and strategies remains, leading to a research-implementation gap. For Ecuador, one of the key challenges to local adaptation are the institutional capacities of the decentralized autonomous governments (GAD, Spanish acronym). Therefore, the objective of this study is firstly to apply a capacity development strategy developed by GIZ (2013a) in the context of limited knowledge and resources and secondly gain a deeper understanding of climate action in Ecuador on a provincial level. The case study is based on an experimental participatory workshop in the coastal province of Santa Elena, Ecuador. The applied methodology has three components: firstly, semi-structured expert interviews on climate action in Ecuador; secondly, the participatory workshops with technicians and employees of the provincial government, its analysis together with a pre-, post- and two-months-after the workshop follow-up survey; thirdly, the analysis of the workshop is complemented by a peer validation of the co-facilitators. The analysis of the workshop suggests that in a context of limited institutional capacity, an understanding of climate change terminology, vulnerability and adaptive capacity is crucial to interpret predictions and to motivate action. Additionally, results indicate that pairing the content of the seminar with elements of project management might also strengthen local planning and longevity of rural development measures. Overall, the methodology of GIZ might therefore not be suitable in the local context due to its fast pace and difficult terminology. A more promising approach to foster local climate action is the Design-Thinking (DT) methodology due to its easier accessibility. Based on the insights of the case study a capacity development strategy incorporating DT offers lessons learnt for practitioners aiming to promote local climate action in comparable institutional contexts of limited knowledge and resources. As limited knowledge and resources are often main barriers to climate action, developing capacity building strategies will in turn foster climate action.},

 abstract = {With an estimated 10.6 million inhabitants in 2015 and an average 6.6% annual growth rate, Kinshasa ranks among the three largest cities in Africa and may well become the most populated. To cope with critically deficient water services, a local NGO supported by different donors has promoted decentralized water systems (DWS) that have spread in the city outskirts, based on a model with original features compared to other African experiences. Here, we intend to provide an empirically grounded and analytically sound inquiry into the relevance, efficiency and sustainability of these DWSs in the context of the megacity of Kinshasa. First, we analyze water provision data from the national water utility and compare these to the detailed operational results of the DWSs to estimate the magnitude and efficiency of this alternative mechanism. Second, the principles identified by Elinor Ostrom as being crucial for institutions to successfully manage commons provide us with a fruitful analytic framework to assess DWS performance and sustainability. We show that some of these criteria are broadly met, but the fulfillment of other criteria is still uncertain. We conclude with a balanced assessment of the efficiency and sustainability of this approach and identify the key challenges.},

 abstract = {Inefficiencies in blood product management systems, including segmented operations, lack of detailed data sharing, and limited real-time visibility, can often result in significant annual losses in product wastage and postponed medical procedures. Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric’s test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.},

 abstract = {The rise of prosumers – individuals who both produce and consume energy – presents a significant opportunity to reshape energy markets and achieve carbon neutrality. However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platform’s potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.},

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.},

Secondly, this paper identifies six main clusters of blockchain-related research contributions and, based on the analysis on centrality and density measures, it classifies research themes in motor themes, basic themes, emerging or disappearing themes, and specialised themes. Despite the majority of contributions belong to the computer science subject area, many papers belonging to the technology management subject area provide pivotal insights for practitioners and policy makers.

To cope with such threads and vulnerabilities, urban sustainability and resilience oriented plans have been developed. Accordingly, policy makers need to learn how to properly integrate urban sustainability with urban resilience principles and practices in the re-shaping of urban agendas. In order to highlight the future potential of integrating transformative resilience principles into the general sustainability approach, this paper provides a critical review of a recent and successful urban regeneration and development plan, the “Mexico City Green Plan”. This paper also discusses a feasibility study for urban redevelopment and transition towards resilience in Mexico City, in order to illustrate the necessity and potential of urban resilience for the improvement of the life prospects of disadvantaged inhabitant groups. The Valle del Chalco neighborhood in Mexico City is presented as an example, whereby resilient and sustainable urban transformation was achieved through an integrated and sustainable decentralized water management and infrastructure plan. In practice, the terms ‘Sustainability’ and ‘Resilience’ can be exploited to justify conventional, non-sustainable urban development practices. The results discussed in this paper demonstrate the necessity of the integration of transformative resilience principles within sustainable urban redevelopment and regeneration. The main findings are i) Policy makers underestimate the potential of urban resilience in shaping more sustainable urban futures, since they only understand resilience as the flipside of specific vulnerabilities, ii) The building of urban resilience within sustainable urban transitions and redevelopment can effectively foster people empowerment, particularly in combination with the decentralization of resources management systems, and iii) The main challenge for the implementation and execution of transitions processes towards urban resilience and sustainability is the elimination of political barriers.},

Critical factors for implementing blockchain under the IIO framework are uncovered. Finally, based on the IIO framework, a future research agenda, which relates to the different stages of blockchain development as well as different topical areas, is established.},

 abstract = {In this study, a multi-agent system (MAS) is incorporated in a decentralized strategy to restore distribution systems while taking into account coupling neighboring microgrids (CNMGs). This provides modeling for renewable energy sources (RESs), electric vehicles (EVs), battery storage systems (BSS) and load. The desired and most favorable restoration path is found by the MAS, in which zone agents are dispersed across the distribution system. The MAS can also manage microgrids (MGs) overloaded as the unbalance operation of RESs, BSS, EVs, and load. This is realized by making a bridge between MGs and neighboring non-overloaded MGs. The suggested method adheres to voltage and power flow restrictions while operating according to expert system standards. The recommended approach is put to the test using a 33-bus radial distribution system. MATLAB calculations on agents and power flow are carried out in order to verify the validity of the choices made by agents. The proposed restoration plan is able to obtain the best power supply path with a low number of switching in the event of a fault so that the voltage magnitude is higher than 0.9 p.u. and free capacity is available for the distribution lines. The smart charging strategy of EVs reduces 93% of their turn off compared to the non-smart charging strategy. However, if the CNMG plan is established, all vehicles can be powered.},

 abstract = {The highly dynamic nature of future computing systems, where applications dynamically emerge as opportunistic aggregation of autonomous and independent resources available at any given time, requires a radical shift in the adopted computing paradigms. Indeed, they should fully reflect the decentralized perspective of the execution environment and consider QoS, scalability and resilience as key objectives. In this context, the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) paradigm, which envisions the creation of new services as an assembly of independent services available within the environment, can greatly help in tackling the challenges of developing future applications. However, in order to be effective, XaaS paradigm requires self-adaptive service assembly solutions able to cope with the unpredictable variability and scalability of the execution environment, the lack of global knowledge, and the QoS requirements of services to be built. We contribute in this direction by designing a fully decentralized and collective self-adaptive service assembly framework whose main features are: (i) self-assembly, i.e., the ability to operate autonomously, (ii) online-learning, i.e., the ability to dynamically learn from experience, (iii) QoS-awareness, i.e., the inclusion of QoS requirements as driving forces for self-assembly, (iv) scalability, i.e., the ability to cope with a large number of services, and (v) resilience, i.e., the ability to maintain the persistence of service delivery when facing unexpected changes (e.g., in the number and/or QoS of services). Simulation experiments show that our solution makes the system able to quickly converge to viable assemblies that improve and maintain over time the social welfare of the system, despite the local perspective of each participating service.},

 abstract = {Electricity generation is decentralising quickly. Simultaneously, final energy use for residential customers electrifies in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Together with ubiquitous digitalisation, this decentralisation and flexibility at the demand side paves the way towards local energy communities and in its most distributed version to peer-to-peer energy trading, where customers buy and sell electricity among each other. Although peer-to-peer energy trading is not yet legal everywhere, citizen energy communities have been introduced as cornerstones of the energy transition by the European Commission in their Clean Energy for All Europeans programme. This paper firstly discusses this digitalisation and decentralisation of the power infrastructure. These trends are supported by distributed information technologies, including peer-to-peer control paradigms. Distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchains, might be one such piece of the puzzle. The second part of the paper investigates whether blockchain technologies, and their associated smart contracts, offer advantages for larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications over a classic, centralised approach. Different blockchain implementations are investigated and qualitatively evaluated from a scalability, efficiency and trust perspective. The conclusion indicates that in the current state of the art, a trade-off between decentralised and more classical (hierarchically centralised) solutions suits larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications best.},

Indeed, most of the user privacy issues related to the centralized Online Social Network (OSN) services (such as Facebook or Google+) do not apply in the case of DOSNs because of the absence of the centralized service provider. However, these new architectures have motivated researchers to investigate new privacy solutions that allow DOSN’s users to protect their contents by taking into account the decentralized nature of the DOSNs platform. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the privacy solutions adopted by currently available DOSNs, and we compare them by exploiting several criteria. After presenting the differences that existing DOSNs present in terms of provided services and architecture, we identify, for each of them, the privacy model used to define the privacy policies and the mechanisms for their management (i.e., initialization and modification of the privacy policy). In addition, we evaluate the overhead introduced by the security mechanisms adopted for privacy policy management and enforcement by discussing their advantages and drawbacks.},

 abstract = {Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new arising terminology of network architecture with outstanding features of orchestration by decoupling the control plane and the data plane in each network element. Even though it brings several benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the single point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down all network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can access to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation owing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the Northbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network topology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even worse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller. Hence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN’s Northbound. Furthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during data exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations, we introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized authentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to assist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With strict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for each request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing over-privileged activities or security policy conflicts. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we also implement a prototype of this framework to evaluate the security impact, effectiveness, and performance through typical use cases.},

 abstract = {Decentralized control paradigms are becoming more and more attractive in an ever-changing commercial environment, where there is a strong trend towards smaller production lot sizes. Whereas centralized scheduling might find a global throughput optimum (even at high computational and implementation cost), decentralized scheduling decisions in a multi-agent system are much more manageable and agents are more robust to handle any interruptions that might take place on the production floor. Compared to a centralised architecture, the development, testing and commissioning is definitely more complex, as it requires the availability of the physical units. Yet these aspects are not visited frequently by research activities. This paper details a novel implementation approach of a multi-agent based production control, that was developed for a lab-contained production environment that serves as test-bed for decentralized scheduling algorithms, with both a nominal operational mode and a simulation mode. The latter one is introduced to ease up the deployment process of the system. The description of the new approach is illustrated with different examples.},

 abstract = {This paper evaluates the effects of the administrative decentralization of education on teacher quality and student outcomes in Colombia. In 2001, the government established an arbitrary rule that granted municipalities with a 2002 population >100,000 almost complete autonomy to provide education services (certification). This analysis takes advantage of this rule to evaluate, using difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity methodologies, the effect of municipal autonomy on teacher quality and student outcomes, including achievement and enrollment. The control group is made up of municipalities for which the provision of education was centralized and managed by the departmental authorities. The results indicate that administrative decentralization (being certified) improves both school enrollment and student achievement as well as the quality of teachers, as measured by teachers’ education level and scores on teachers’ entry competency exams. Using a mediation analysis, the paper finds that higher-quality teachers hired by the certified municipalities partially explained the improvement in student achievement. This analysis also shows that “certified” municipalities invest more local resources in education which also contributes to explain to a much lesser extent their superior educational outcomes. Finally, the results suggest that achieving better student outcomes is less related to the amount of resources that decentralized municipalities managed and more associated with the fact that those resources seem to have been better allocated, generating significant efficiency gains. These gains may be the consequence of lower transaction costs of matching local preferences with local educational interventions.},

The integration of blockchain technology into the education system has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency, security, and credibility of the educational process. By creating secure and transparent platforms for tracking and verifying students' academic achievements, blockchain technology can help to create a more accessible and trustworthy education system, making it easier for students to showcase their skills and knowledge to potential employers. While the potential benefits of blockchain in education are significant, there are also several challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of this technology in the educational sector. Some of the major challenges include adoption, technical knowledge, interoperability, regulation, cost, data privacy and security, scalability, and accessibility. The necessary equipment for the implementation of blockchain technology in education is diverse and critical to the success of this innovative technology. Organizations should carefully consider this equipment when planning their implementation of blockchain technology in education to ensure the efficient and secure transfer of educational data and transactions within the blockchain network.

The average and the peak load of the village are around 8 kW and 16.5 kW respectively. The feasibility of using locally produced biogas to drive a backup engine in comparison to using a diesel engine as backup has been explored through a techno-economic analysis using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables). This hybrid system has also been compared with a single diesel based power system. The results show that the hybrid system integrated with the biogas engine as backup can be a better solution than using a diesel engine as backup. The share of power generation by PV, wind and biogas are 49%, 19% and 32%, respectively. The LCOE (Levelized Cost of Electricity) of generated electricity by this hybrid system ($0.25/kWh) is about 20% cheaper than that with a diesel engine as backup ($0.31/kWh), while the capital cost and the total NPC (Net Present Cost) are about 30% and 18% lower, respectively.

Moreover, ideal segmentation with a large scale participation is another economic issue in terms of allocation of total profit among aggregators. In this context, this study proposes a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market incorporating Multi-agent System (MAS) which consists different three agents with variable power levels. In the MAS environment, while Agent-1 represents a community which has variable household number according to the case studies, Agent-2 is an independent aggregator who is not included in, and does not influence the transactions of the Agent-1. Finally, Agent-3 is the ENKA Insaat ve Sanayi A.S. which has office buildings equipped with electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and photovoltaic (PV) panels. In the paper, all the agents simultaneously solve their own sub-problems by distributed way according to the received dynamic price signals along with the availability of the responsive demands. Moreover, 132 case studies consisting of low, medium, and large scale with different prosumer penetration are created in order to obtain optimal grouping strategy. The obtained results indicate that the group formation under middle penetrations gives the highest cost reductions, and the total cost reductions of Agent-1 and Agent-3 are 24.9% and 13.14%, respectively, while the total profit of Agent-2 is 4.53$ according to the best solution.},

@article{GUI2014178,
 abstract = {In recent years the concept of “organization” has been gradually accepted as a suitable abstraction for the development of open multi-agent systems with dynamic agents. By modelling interactions based on roles, this abstraction allows an organization to be modelled independently of its participating agents so as to support agent dynamicity. A natural requirement from the abstraction is that agents need to be “organization aware”—that is they must be able to inquire, import, and execute roles from the organization. However, how to adequately support those processes in a decentralized and dynamic environment is still an open issue. This paper addresses this problem by presenting ATALK, a novel decentralized agent middleware that fulfills the above requirements. A role component model is designed to facilitate role deployment, reflection and uniform role interaction. In order to support role dynamicity, a compositional agent architecture allowing dynamic role integration and enactment is proposed. Moreover, ATALK allows agents to hand over their role to other agents of a same organization with their run-time states. Thus, agents can dynamically relinquish their roles without jeopardizing the normal execution of the organization. This paper also evaluates our design and current prototypic implementation through both qualitative analysis and simulations. Our results show that ATALK achieves remarkable organization reconfigurability with little additional overhead.},

 abstract = {The widespread diffusion of Online Social Networks has given unforeseen opportunities for their users to share contents and mutually interact. However, current platforms offer inadequate guarantees as far as concerns the privacy of their users. To address these issues and leave to the users more control on their data, several recent proposals suggest to decentralize the storage of social data, aiming at leaving their control entirely to their owners. This approach has lead to the definition of Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs), ranging from completely decentralized solutions, i.e. P2P solutions, to hybrid systems integrating external and private resources for storing user data. While DOSNs allow users to have more control over their data, they raise new challenges concerning the management and availability of social data. Guaranteeing data availability in a highly dynamic environment, defining proper algorithms for information diffusion and guaranteeing data privacy in a distributed setting are currently open problems in this area. This survey presents an overview of these challenges and of the main solutions presented in the literature. Existing proposals are classified taking into account the strategies adopted to manage social data, focusing on the data availability and on information diffusion. The survey also presents the new privacy issues arising in DOSNs. Finally, an overview of the main open issues in this research area is presented.},

@article{GUSTAFSSON2019133,
 abstract = {Weak institutions have been identified as a principal cause of the poor developmental outcomes of many resource-rich states. Research has largely focused on national-level institutions and governance, whereas their subnational equivalents remain understudied. Subnational governments, partially empowered by decentralization reforms, have increasingly sought to use existing institutions to influence mineral resource governance although they have no formal authority over such resources. This article examines the implementation of land-use zoning and planning in three Peruvian regions (2007–2016). It focuses on how and when subnational governments seek to influence mineral governance and under what conditions they succeed in strengthening institutions for inclusive and sustainable development. Theoretically, the article draws on the literature on decentralized forest governance and empirically it is based on extensive ethnographic research carried out in the three regions, written primary sources and 139 semi-structured interviews. Our analysis suggests that, whereas regional governments have strong incentives to use land-use zoning to influence mineral governance, they often lack capacity, accountable representation, and support from the central government. Still, land-use zoning has provided regional governments with information about natural resources that has been used in negotiations with mining companies, but also to improve regional planning. To have durable impacts on development, profound state reform to achieve sectoral integration and political decentralization is, however, needed. Our findings add to debates about extractive governance by showing how subnational governments, without having formal authority over mineral resources, still play an important role in shaping the developmental outcomes of resource extraction. Our paper also provokes important questions regarding how subnational governments could be included in extractive governance and which mechanisms for reconciling different interests are likely to be most effective. All told, a better understanding of how inclusive subnational institutions are effectively enforced and gain stability is crucial for transforming resource wealth into sustainable development.},

 abstract = {The rise in the cost of essentials affects every nation around the world, but it has become a major concern for developing nations. It is getting increasingly difficult to keep up with rising prices for everyday items in these countries, where the majority of the population is from the middle class or lower middle class. Inflation, pandemics, wars, and other important variables all contribute to price increases. There may be another significant factor at play, which is supply-chain corruption. The supply chain's unreliable, chaotic, and opaque nature is to blame for this corruption. We are concentrating on the agri-food supply chain in our study. Because many of the current agri-food supply chains are intricate and challenging to monitor, dishonest parties can exploit the situation. Therefore, we suggested a thorough blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to identify the source of price increases. The private Ethereum blockchain was used in the suggested system. Since the private Ethereum blockchain is more efficient, safe, and fast, it was chosen. Smart contracts were created to describe the system and its underlying rules and laws. Furthermore, in order to showcase the usefulness of our smart contracts, we exhibited a sample decentralized application to support our hypothesis. We also gave the system a complete security and vulnerability assessment to make sure it is operating properly and is protected from threats and attacks. Due to the use of blockchain, the system is immutable, transparent, and simple to track and monitor. The proposed system has demonstrated greater transparency, traceability, reliability, speed, security, and cost-efficiency compared to conventional systems. It effectively traces the origin of corruption in the supply chain, providing a more straightforward means to tackle concerns related to price hikes.},

 abstract = {A blockchain-based smart contract has the potential to allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. This paper presents a universal framework for a blockchain platform that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in the retail electricity market. Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading. Moreover, the authentic gas consumption and computational time to the smart contract indicate that this platform is able to achieve an efficient and effective transaction with multi-player participation.},

This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems have been widely used in different application domains including energy-preservation, e-commerce, healthcare, social media, etc. Such applications require the analysis and mining of massive amounts of various types of user data, including demographics, preferences, social interactions, etc. in order to develop accurate and precise recommender systems. Such datasets often include sensitive information, yet most recommender systems are focusing on the models’ accuracy and ignore issues related to security and the users’ privacy. Despite the efforts to overcome these problems using different risk reduction techniques, none of them has been completely successful in ensuring cryptographic security and protection of the users’ private information. To bridge this gap, the blockchain technology is presented as a promising strategy to promote security and privacy preservation in recommender systems, not only because of its security and privacy salient features, but also due to its resilience, adaptability, fault tolerance and trust characteristics. This paper presents a holistic review of blockchain-based recommender systems covering challenges, open issues and solutions. Accordingly, a well-designed taxonomy is introduced to describe the security and privacy challenges, overview existing frameworks and discuss their applications and benefits when using blockchain before indicating opportunities for future research.},

Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.},

Some key radical technologies in 6G together with existing 5G candidate schemes will guarantee the expected quality of experience (QoE) to attain ubiquitous wireless connectivity for the Internet of Everything (IoE) ranging from the telecom industry to digital smart industries. Blockchain technology (BCT) has gained significant attention due to undertake the decentralization, transparency, spectrum resource scarcity, inherent privacy and security, interoperability, confidentiality, and emerging smart applications domains including Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Industry 5.0 applications. The mismatch between the requirements of many data intensive disruptive IoT applications and 5G network capabilities steered the demand of decentralized BCT based 6G architecture. Inspired by these facts, this paper studies an extensive survey to draw a new direction of blockchain integration into 6G mobile networks, IoT technologies, and smart industries in terms of infrastructure sharing, computational loads, latency, bandwidth overhead, business model, sustainability goals, and edge intelligence focusing the potential merits and challenges. We highlighted the convergence of IoT in blockchain to enable intelligent distribution in future IIoT and the technical model of 6G networks to realize the successful deployment of BCT schemes.

Blockchain technology can address such challenging complexities efficiently. This paper presents a thorough literature review of all potential blockchain applications in electric energy systems. First, all potential blockchain application possibilities and constraints in electric energy systems have been identified. Then, the implementations of blockchain technology in power systems are divided into various categories, such as demand response (DR), EVs, decentralized energy management, energy trading and distributed renewable energy. A detailed literature analysis is conducted by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in a systematic approach using credible and reliable database systems such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Scopus to highlight current advancements in blockchain technology uses in electric energy systems particularly in DR, as well as future potential and existing problems. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part lists the important publications that have delved into the implementation of Blockchain in demand response. Trends of Blockchain applications in other electric energy system areas are detailed in the second section. The final part highlights the evolution and advancement of blockchain-based electric energy systems including favourable attributes of structures and designs, as well as the challenges and future trends.},

Following the trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G.

In-house efficacy of such systems has been greatly improved due to lean six-sigma methodologies; however, wider scale distribution and supply has undergone little to no transformation over the past century. Research pertaining to distributed manufacture, cloud-manufacture and reconfigurable systems have provided several decentralized models using traditional manufacturing capabilities. Due to practical limitations they have not been fully realized to date. This paper outlines the emerging concept and scope for hybrid manufacturing platforms – systems using a plurality of processes on a single motion platform, to manufacture products in a decentralized network. Necessity of on-machine inspection is highlighted, outlining the potential of generic artifact machine calibration and verification of parts made. A robust experimental method using a novel hybrid manufacturing approach is used to realize the post-process adaptation of subsequent parts and demonstrates significant improvement with adapted features being cut within 15μm of nominal position, compared to the original 300μm error. Social, economic and environmental ramifications of adopting such a system are highlighted. The combination of several key processes will allow users to manufacture parts with minimal intervention. A move to personal fabrication would allow greater customization and convenience for the end user; however, the issues of copyright and loss of economy of scale would inhibit mass uptake in the near-future. Growing interest by enthusiasts and early adopters will continue to make an impact on the way the populace views manufacture.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT
Electrochemical biosensors have the potential to provide rapid and inexpensive diagnostics while moving clinical testing from centralized labs to point-of-care (POC) applications. Conductive materials functionalized with bioreceptors that remain stable and functional for measurements in real-world conditions are essential for the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors, and carbon-based nanomaterials provide the electrical, chemical, structural, and mechanical features that make them suitable for POC devices. This review details the most recent developments in the use of carbon-based nanostructures, with a focus on one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, two-dimensional graphene, and graphene oxide, their interface with biological receptors, deposition on portable, flexible, and wearable substrates, and integration on low-cost platforms for detection of clinical biomarkers. The large-scale manufacturing and implementation of microneedles as implantable and electronic tattoos as wearable devices for on-skin diagnostics, and lab-on-mouth platforms as well as the interface with mobile technologies and their potential implementation for remote POC monitoring and decentralized healthcare through cloud processing and the internet of things (IoT) are discussed with examples of applications. The review concludes with an overview of the regulatory perspectives and future trends, challenges, and opportunities for commercialization and translation of these technologies from the research lab to practice, as useful diagnostic tools for remote monitoring of patient health conditions.},

 abstract = {The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has resulted in a proliferation of connected devices and their applications. Autonomous IoT (AIoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices that operate without human intervention, making decisions and performing tasks autonomously. Traditional methods of provisioning IoT devices, such as manual configuration and over-the-air updates, are error-prone and insecure. The emergence of eSIMs (embedded SIMs) provides a viable solution for secure and flexible identity management in IoT devices. This work implements a low-cost, zero-touch remote provisioning system using GSMA standard Over-The-Air (OTA) IoT-SAFE protocol. This research predicts that future IoT devices will be eSIM-enabled, which are simple to configure, provision, validate profiles, and check security policies remotely. IoT onboarding processes are designed where blockchains are used to verify immutable repositories to store this network manifests, verifiable by Ethereum smart contracts. The integrated framework combines blockchain contracts, eSIM-based remote SIM provisioning through IoT-SAFE protocol, and SDN to manage IoT ecosystems' security. The proposed solution is evaluated using simulations and security analysis, and it demonstrates its feasibility at scale and resilience to attacks even under insecure environments. When compared with the baseline IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, our SDN-based Remote-SIM provisioning system (SIeSIM) reduces overhead to about 240 ms Time-To-Provision (TTP), outperforming manual provisioning by nearly 320 % and 210 % compared to expert provisioning in terms of TTP performances, respectively.},

 abstract = {Manufacturers are increasingly aware of the importance of system resilience against unexpected disruptive occurrences, such as the recent global Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical wars in Europe. Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.},

 abstract = {In large cities with harbors or rivers, ferry services have been an important part of public transport. In practice, many ferry terminals are subject to geographical and environmental conditions, limited space resources of the terminal pool, and restricted navigable waters of ships, which leads to constrained operations and increases the difficulty of docking when multiple ferries enter and depart from the terminal. Because of the distributed, real-time and dynamic characteristics of multi-ferry maneuvering, this paper proposes a decentralized, time-optimal control strategy to coordinate the maneuvering of multiple entering and departing ferries in restricted terminals. It combines nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) with an iterative learning control (ILC) framework. Based on the states and maneuver data of previously successfully performed trajectories, the coupled constraints among multiple ferries are decomposed with support vector machine (SVM). Therefore, it also does not require real-time information exchange during ferry operations and has the merits of low communication demand, as only local information is required in each ferry controller. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {Effective governance plays a pivotal role in aligning the interests of diverse stakeholders and shaping the strategic directions of organizations. However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.},

This study conducts a composite of qualitative and quantitative analyses of 622 selected articles on blockchain in the energy field. It is dedicated to identifying feasible technical paths and potential themes. The results show that (1) Research in this field follows two main approaches: engineering- and management-oriented. (2) Management-oriented research has become mainstream. (3) Research has led to new transaction systems, and the commercialization of energy blockchains has driven research iterations. Thematic predictions call for more attention to the negative impacts of technology, such as new business risks, the problem of lagging regulations, and the drawbacks of high energy consumption.

 abstract = {The ability of sociotechnical systems to recover from disruptions through decentralized, bottom-up processes is a crucial element of their overall resilience, but it is also among the most overlooked in resilience research. This paper proposes a computational framework leveraging dynamic multi-agent networks to conceptualize, model, and quantify multi-agent, decentralized recovery process building upon strategic network formation methods. This innovative approach addresses limitations in conventional strategic network formation models by accounting for the fluidity of structural shifts induced by the strategic behaviors of individual agents, and by acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity within agent populations. The central objective of this study is to highlight the critical role of bottom-up recovery and present a systematic, adaptable framework for modeling these processes in diverse real-world scenarios. We achieve this through four key elements: modeling post-disruption responses, exploring their interdependencies, accommodating multiple equilibria, and generating metrics for scenario comparison and forecasting. Our dynamic strategic network formation model offers valuable insights into crucial trade-offs in decentralized recovery processes and facilitates the integration of both bottom-up and top-down resilience strategies. Furthermore, it could serve as a predictive tool informing initial network architectural decisions by estimating likely post-disruption equilibrium states based on the initial network structure. Ultimately, this study provides a robust platform for analyzing network efficiency and resilience trade-offs, setting the stage for more informed decision-making in complex sociotechnical systems.},

 abstract = {Blockchain-based drug supply management (DSM) requires powerful security and privacy procedures for high-level authentication, interoperability, and medical record sharing. Researchers have shown a surprising interest in Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart cities in recent years. By providing a variety of intelligent applications, such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, and smart financing, smart cities (SC) can improve the quality of life for their residents. Blockchain technology (BCT) can allow SC to offer a higher standard of security by keeping track of transactions in an immutable, secure, decentralized, and transparent distributed ledger. The goal of this study is to systematically explore the current state of research surrounding cutting-edge technologies, particularly the deployment of BCT and the IoT in DSM and SC. In this study, the defined keywords “blockchain”, “IoT”, drug supply management”, “healthcare”, and “smart cities” as well as their variations were used to conduct a systematic search of all relevant research articles that were collected from several databases such as Science Direct, JStor, Taylor & Francis, Sage, Emerald insight, IEEE, INFORMS, MDPI, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The final collection of papers on the use of BCT and IoT in DSM and SC is organized into three categories. The first category contains articles about the development and design of DSM and SC applications that incorporate BCT and IoT, such as new architecture, system designs, frameworks, models, and algorithms. Studies that investigated the use of BCT and IoT in the DSM and SC make up the second category of research. The third category is comprised of review articles regarding the incorporation of BCT and IoT into DSM and SC-based applications. Furthermore, this paper identifies various motives for using BCT and IoT in DSM and SC, as well as open problems and makes recommendations. The current study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a complete review of potential alternatives and finding areas where further research is needed. As a consequence of this, researchers are presented with intriguing potential to further create decentralized DSM and SC apps as a result of a comprehensive discussion of the relevance of BCT and its implementation.},

 abstract = {The research community has traditionally aimed at the derivation and development of metaheuristic solvers, suited to deal with problems of very diverse characteristics. Unfortunately, it is often the case that new metaheuristic techniques are presented and assessed in a reduced set of cases, mostly due to the lack of computational resources to undertake extensive performance studies over a sufficiently diverse set of optimization benchmarks. This manuscript explores how ephemeral environments could be exploited to efficiently construct metaheuristic algorithms by virtue of a collaborative, distributed nature-inspired hyperheuristic framework specifically designed to be deployed over unreliable, uncoordinated computation nodes. To this end, the designed framework defines two types of nodes (trackers and peers, similarly to peer-to-peer networks), both reacting resiliently to unexpected disconnections of nodes disregarding their type. Peer nodes exchange their populations (i.e. constructed algorithms) asynchronously, so that local optima are avoided at every peer thanks to the contribution by other nodes. Furthermore, the overall platform is fully scalable, allowing its users to implement and share newly derived operators and fitness functions so as to enrich the diversity and universality of the heuristic algorithms found by the framework. Results obtained from in-lab experiments with a reduced number of nodes are discussed to shed light on the evolution of the best solution of the framework with the number of connected peers and the tolerance of the network to node disconnections.},

 abstract = {The importance of moving towards sustainable energy systems is critical to achieving societal sustainability. Transitions theory is a useful approach to look at the potential and limitations of systemic transitions, and has been applied in a number of alternative contexts. In the current study, we examine transitions theory and its implications for the progress of decentralized energy systems in Japan in the period after the Fukushima accident of 2011. Empirical data from a targeted nation-wide survey is used to examine the progress and change in consumer preference and behavior since the disaster, as possible evidence for the potential transition paths likely to be occurring. Importantly, this study utilizes data that examines a spectrum of urban–rural and disaster–non-disaster areas in order to explore whether any differences in response patterns were present. Results indicate that although the desire of stakeholders has been to change the energy system, there are barriers to transformation. Variation between rural and urban sites and between disaster-affected and unaffected areas was examined, indicating that (at least under the chosen classification) there was surprisingly little difference. The results have implications for understanding transitions at a much broader level, and imply that, if the empirical data is a useful indicator, Japan is within a locked-in or reorganization transition. In order to move to a more radical conversion type change a new approach is likely to be required to nurture niche innovations effectively.},

However, a comprehensive review of recent advancements in trust models based on blockchain for social networks is lacking. To address this gap, our survey takes a comprehensive perspective on the theme of trust within decentralized networks. We examine various concepts such as the trust concept itself, trust models, trust prediction methodologies, decentralization in trust-based social networks, and the role of blockchain in fortifying trust and security in social networks. We investigate the intersection of trust and blockchain technology, encompassing concepts, types of blockchain, and their applications in social networks. These models are categorized based on different parameters, and we examine both their advantages and limitations.

However, the outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted this practice, forcing universities to prioritize the safety of individuals during exams. In response, a shift to online assessments occurred, bringing forth new challenges such as academic dishonesty and inadequate infrastructure. This study presents a novel approach to decentralized in-person exams for geographically dispersed students. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed, followed by a mixed-integer linear reformulation, to optimally determine the scheduling of exams, test center locations, and student allocation, while addressing the incorporation of both hard and soft constraints. Given the complexity of the problem, we have implemented meta-heuristic algorithms to solve larger instances, including genetic and simulated-annealing algorithms. Additionally, we have devised a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of population-based and local-search algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we used real data collected from our department during the fall semester of 2022. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the hybrid algorithm compared to others, in terms of both effectiveness and adaptability. It remains consistent across different scenarios, effectively addressing real-world complexities. Finally, a comparison between centralized and decentralized scenarios underscores the advantages of the latter approach during the pandemic.},

These improvements emphasize the nature of decentralized property rights, linking the outputs of decentralization with its outcomes and the inclusion of contextual factors. Applying MAPAF to analyze outputs and outcomes from two major decentralized forest policies in Ethiopia, i.e., delegation and devolution, has demonstrated the following strengths of the framework. First, by incorporating vital bundles of property rights into APAF, MAPAF creates a common ground for exploring and comparing the extent of democratization achieved by different decentralizing reforms.

 abstract = {The accelerating investment in artificial intelligence has vast implications for economic and cognitive development globally. However, AI is currently dominated by an oligopoly of centralized mega-corporations, who focus on the interests of their stakeholders. There is a now universal need for AI services by businesses who lack access to capital to develop their own AI services, and independent AI developers lack visibility and a source of revenue. This uneven playing field has a high potential to lead to inequitable circumstances with negative implications for humanity. Furthermore, the potential of AI is hindered by the lack of interoperability standards. The authors herein propose an alternative path for the development of AI: a distributed, decentralized, and democratized market for AIs run on distributed ledger technology. We describe the features and ethical advantages of such a system using SingularityNET, a watershed project being developed by Ben Goertzel and colleagues, as a case study. We argue that decentralizing AI opens the doors for a more equitable development of AI and AGI. It will also create the infrastructure for coordinated action between AIs that will significantly facilitate the evolution of AI into true AGI that is both highly capable and beneficial for humanity and beyond.},

In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices.

 abstract = {Summary
Pakistan, home of the world’s most extensive irrigation system, has followed a global trend in irrigation to devolve management from government to farmers and farmer organizations. We implement the most extensive survey of irrigation management ever conducted in Pakistan to examine variation in farmer participation in managing local irrigation systems under the new governance regime. Building on and adding to previous work in Pakistan and elsewhere, we examine the effects of privately accessed groundwater, groundwater quality, surface water, and other factors along 5 different community management responsibilities, including roles that existed prior to decentralization (maintenance of the watercourse and dispute resolution) and new roles that were created after (voting to elect representative at the higher level, collection of water charges, and holding internal meetings). Each responsibility represents a collection action problem for the community. We find that while group leader education is important in successful execution of the roles, voting has in general been taken up enthusiastically while water charge collection remains, not surprisingly, low. We find a previously unreported inverse-U shaped relationship between groundwater availability and farmer participation, and that availability of high groundwater quality (less-saline) groundwater significantly reduces participation, as does high variation in canal water supply within a growing season. We also find, contrary to expectation, that communities in the tail reaches of the system, known to receive worse canal water service, more actively participate in managing their local irrigation systems. The findings have important implications for the continued push for decentralized surface irrigation management in South Asia and elsewhere as groundwater irrigation continues to expand and equitable access to surface water remains a policy concern.},

The authors have developed a tracking system for car actions using the Blockchain system based on the Exonum platform. Mathematical foundations of this system are presented in the article. Data input and confirmation of their acceptance of the transaction is carried out using an Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA security is related to the complexity of the private key search task described in the article. This largely relates to the management of large-scale systems, such as transport system. Failure to follow simple rules and recommendations can lead to serious consequences, such as road accidents and congestion. Therefore, the proposed system can assist in making decisions with autonomous cars and in investigating crimes as well as traffic offences.},

 abstract = {Decentralized (parent-affiliates) business groups encompass independent firms sharing production resources under common administrative or financial control. Due to the complexity of integrated decision-making, business groups often delegate pricing and technology decisions to separated units. With the growing prevalence of transfer technology in multi-plant operations, there arises a demand for modeling frameworks capturing the joint impact of transfer prices and technology on affiliates’ production. In this paper, we propose an operational methodology to integrate transfer prices and technology, as incentive mechanisms driving affiliates’ production decisions. This consists of a single-leader-multi-follower game where a parent firm (the leader) operates in a single-product market and delegates production to profit-maximizing affiliate firms (the followers). In addition to providing data-driven support for integrated decision-making, our framework reveals how managerial structures respond to the growing significance of intangible technology. In this line, based on the parent’s control of the value chain we present two specifications and solution approaches: full delegation and partial delegation. For the former, we provide an exact characterization of the equilibrium solution; whereas for business groups operating under full delegation, we provide tight lower and upper bounds, computable by state-of-the-art optimization solvers. Our empirical tests rely on a customized version of the Orbis data set. Figures show that our methodology not only integrates the substitutability between transfer prices and technology, as well as their dependency on the parent’s control of the value chain, but also gives rise to a flexible computational approach that is applicable to a wide range of decentralized business groups.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, modern automotive systems include a great number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs). These ECUs provide many sophisticated systems such as engine control, antilock braking systems, etc. This fact has increased the automotive embedded networks complexity. Another important issue in this field is the necessity to define a suitable diagnosis strategy to prevent faults propagation. The integration of diagnosis functions into the automotive embedded systems contributes to overload the communication protocols. In this context, solutions for checking latencies entailed by extra-data traffic are urgently needed. Throughout this paper, a novel approach for the automotive diagnosis design, which is based on the Controller Area Network (CAN) analysis, is detailed. The principal contribution of this work consists in developing a decentralized fault diagnosis and studying its data traffic effect on messages deadlines. Our novel method, “CAN real-time analysis based on decentralized fault diagnosis”, is a step ahead to a reliable early phase automotive design. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is applied on a model of an advanced anti-crash system. The proposed design methodology presents several advantages. It optimizes the schedulability of tasks and facilitates the design validation. Moreover, a realistic hardware-in-the-loop simulation is carried out to validate our work.},

 abstract = {Airline disruption management traditionally seeks to address three problem dimensions: aircraft scheduling, crew scheduling, and passenger scheduling, in that order. However, current efforts have, at most, only addressed the first two problem dimensions concurrently and do not account for the propagative effects that uncertain scheduling outcomes in one dimension can have on another dimension. In addition, existing approaches for airline disruption management include human specialists who decide on necessary corrective actions for airline schedule disruptions on the day of operation. However, human specialists are limited in their ability to process copious amounts of information imperative for making robust decisions that simultaneously address all problem dimensions during disruption management. Therefore, there is a need to augment the decision-making capabilities of a human specialist with quantitative and qualitative tools that can rationalize complex interactions amongst all dimensions in airline disruption management, and provide objective insights to the specialists in the airline operations control center. To that effect, we provide a discussion and demonstration of an agnostic and systematic paradigm for enabling expeditious simultaneously-integrated recovery of all problem dimensions during airline disruption management, through an intelligent multi-agent system that employs principles from artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. Results indicate that our paradigm for simultaneously-integrated recovery executes in polynomial time and is effective when all the flights in the airline route network are disrupted.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger technology that allows for the immutable and auditable logging of transactions without needing a central authority or centralized database. First introduced in 2008 as the technology behind the digital currency Bitcoin, blockchain has now found use in a wide range of sectors. Modern agriculture supply networks have emerged to accommodate intricate interactions between regional actors and the agricultural environment. Interactions between various participants in the supply chain, including those involved in manufacturing, processing, and delivery. One of the main reasons fraud happens so often in agriculture is the lack of transparency in the supply chain. Businesses that aren’t transparent run the risk of losing money, alienating their customers, and seeing their brands decline in value. To encourage the growth of an efficient and trustworthy trading environment, several fundamental adjustments to the current supply chain architecture are necessary. The potential for blockchain technology to enhance food and agricultural supply chain transparency is well acknowledged. Companies utilize IoT and blockchain to create more equitable, sustainable, and customer-friendly food manufacturing systems. In this current work, a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp), ‘ASBlock’, is developed for agricultural-based supply chain management. The primary focus of this developed application is to bring transparency and security to all participating users of the application; the users of this application include farmers or producers, suppliers or retailers, hotels, and end users. The performance analysis shows that the average gas utilization of the proposed ASBlock dApp is ∼ 2.8 ⋆ 104. The average smart contract execution time for all use cases is ∼ 112sec.},

We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions—transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement—, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger.

The control scheme is designed for implementation in a modular controller architecture, where a collection of subcontrollers is employed, with each subcontroller being associated with a subsystem that represents a component of the vibrating structure. Each subcontroller uses state feedback from adjacent subsystem sensors to perform vibration suppression and energy harvesting using a switching control law. Furthermore, the assumption is made that neighbouring subcontrollers exchange information collaboratively to estimate the effects of coupling forces, achieving control efficiency comparable to that of a centralized approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a modular suspension platform equipped with semi-active dampers and electromagnetic energy harvesters. The approach is evaluated under various free vibration scenarios, encompassing faulty measurement conditions, and is compared to passive and heuristic state-feedback control strategies.

According to the properties of nonlinear ARO, a modified analytical target cascading method is further developed to formulate the consistency constraints on shared tie-lines, thus guaranteeing the optimality and enhancing the solution quality of the DD-ARO model. Finally, an iterative solution algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the resulting multi-level non-convex DD-ARO model.

 abstract = {Blockchain Technology has garnered significant attention due to its immense potential to transform the way transactions are conducted and information is managed. Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that is spread across a network of computers, ensuring the secure, transparent, and unchangeable recording of transactions. However, the energy consumption of certain blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, Zcash, and others has generated apprehensions regarding the sustainability of this technology. Bitcoin alone consumes approximately 100 terawatt-hours annually, contributing significantly to global carbon emissions. The substantial energy requirements not only contribute to carbon emissions but also pose a risk to the long-term viability of the blockchain industry. This study reviews articles from eight reputable databases between 2017 to August 2023, employing the systematic review and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses approach for screening. Therefore, explore the applications of sustainable blockchain networks aimed at reducing environmental impact while ensuring efficiency and security. This survey also assesses the challenges and limitations posed by diverse blockchain applications regarding sustainability and provides valuable foresight into potential future advancements. Through this survey, the aim is to track and verify sustainable practices, facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy, and promoting environmental stewardship, with a specific focus on highlighting the potential of sustainable blockchain networks in enabling secure and transparent tracking of these practices. Finally, the paper sheds light on pertinent research challenges and provides a roadmap of future directions, stimulating further research in this promising field.},

 abstract = {Diabetes poses a global health challenge, demanding continuous monitoring and expert care for effective management. Conventional monitoring methods lack real-time insights and secure data-sharing capabilities, necessitating innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are mass-produced and designed for different applications, ranging from monitoring of the environment to on-demand electrical switches, and so on. These IoT devices are often heterogeneous in nature, only to receive updates at infrequent intervals, and can remain ‘out of sight’ on a home or office network for extended periods. In other words, security and privacy are two key (research and operational) challenges in IoT systems. In recent years, there have been attempts to design deep learning-based solutions to mitigate limitations associated with detection systems designed for typical operational technology (OT) systems, although a number of challenges remain. This paper proposes a federated-based approach that employs a deep autoencoder to detect​ botnet attacks using on-device decentralized traffic data. Through the suggested federated solution, privacy is addressed by ensuring the device’s data is not transferred or moved off the network edge. Instead, the machine learning computation itself is brought to where the data is born (i.e. the edge layer), with the added benefit of data security. We demonstrate that using our proposed model, we can achieve up to 98% accuracy rate in the anomaly detection when using features such as source IP, MAC-IP, and destination IP, etc., for training. The overall comparative performance analysis between our decentralized proposed approach and a centralized format demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy rate of attack detection.},

We developed a comprehensive DAO definition by reviewing the literature and empirically analyzing 1,859 DAOs. The findings show that many DAOs were inactive and that a threshold of 20 tokenholders is a tipping point for DAOs to survive over time and maintain sustained levels of activity. Finally, based on an empirical analysis of 9,845 perceived DAOs, we identified the emerging development of off-chain voting. This emerging development challenges the autonomous nature of DAOs. We recommend further research to investigate the effect of governance structures on their long-term sustainability and viability for both on-chain and off-chain DAOs.},

 abstract = {Intelligent manufacturing systems rely on the capability to adapt and evolve to face the volatility of dynamic markets. The complexity of these systems increases with the demand of more customized and quality products, which requires more agile and flexible methods to support the dynamic and on-the-fly system reconfiguration aiming to respond quickly to product changes, by offering more efficient services. In this service-oriented manufacturing context, where process functionalities are modelled as services (e.g., quality control, welding and transportation), the dynamic reconfiguration of the services structure (e.g., in terms of quality, processing time and provided features) assumes a critical role to achieve the referred requirements. Despite the current research efforts, the service reconfiguration approaches usually use reactive event triggers, with decisions coming from a centralized decision-maker and performed manually. This means a lack of dynamic and run-time reconfiguration flexibility by discovering opportunities and needs to change, and, thus, exploring possible actions leading to new and appropriate system configurations. To overcome the mentioned issues, it is essential to provide solutions that answer to when and how to reconfigure a manufacturing system in an integrated, automatic and dynamic manner. For this purpose, this paper introduces an agent-based approach for service reconfiguration in manufacturing systems that allows the identification of opportunities in a pro-active and dynamic manner, and the on-the-fly implementation of new configuration solutions leading to a better production efficiency. The experimental results, using a flexible manufacturing system case study, allowed to verify the feasibility and benefits of the proposed agent-based service reconfiguration solution for competitive and collaborative industrial automation scenarios.},

 abstract = {Bitcoin introduced delegation of control over a monetary system from a select few to all who participate in that system. This delegation is known as the decentralization of controlling power and is a powerful security mechanism for the ecosystem. After the introduction of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency has seen widespread attention from industry and academia, so much so that the original novel contribution of Bitcoin, i.e., decentralization, may be overlooked, due to decentralizations’ assumed fundamental existence for the functioning of such crypto-assets. However, recent studies have observed a trend of increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As this increased centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain, it is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate control. This research derives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review. This is followed by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We systematically analyzed 89 research papers published between 2009 and 2019. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the multiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We identify different aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing taxonomy of centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of centralization, classified over six architectural layers: Governance, Network, Consensus, Incentive, Operational, and Application. We also discuss how the implications of centralization can vary depending on the aspects studied. We believe that this review and taxonomy provides a comprehensive overview of centralization in decentralized blockchains involving various conceptualizations and measures.},

 abstract = {Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the most widely accepted cryptography protocol to enable secure communication over the web. PKI comprises digital certificates managed by the certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the user’s identity, thus providing secure communication channels. However, the security of PKI is profoundly reliant on the reliability of these third-party CAs, which serves as a single point of failure for PKI. Over the past, there have been several incidents of popular CA breaches, where the centralized operation model of CAs caused numerous targeted attacks due to the spread of rogue certificates. In this paper, we aim to make the CA pool completely decentralized and concurrently build our decentralized solution cooperative with established PKI standards (i.e., X.509) for effective real-world integration. In particular, we harness blockchain technology to propose a decentralized PKI framework named ProofChain, which provides complete trust among a decentralized group of CAs. Our proposed solution provides all the traditional X.509 PKI operations (i.e., registration, validation, verification, and revocation), making it compatible with existing PKI standards. We have also evaluated ProofChain against popular security standards (i.e., the CIA triad model) and PKI adversarial attacks. Besides, to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed system, we have also evaluated the performance of the ProofChain by implementing it on the private testbed of the Ethereum network across various real-world PKI scenarios.},

However, current practices are inadequate for both effectiveness and efficiency since they mainly depend on centralized authority. This paper is designed in two folds; first, a generic blockchain-based online dispute resolution platform is tested with two litigation cases collected in 1999 and 2009 to show the need for a construction-focused system. Then, a new construction-specific framework, Decentralized Construction Enabling Transparent Resolution (DCENTR), is proposed to address the unique nature of construction projects. Ultimately, it is shown that dispute likelihood can be minimized through reliable contract and payment execution, and if occurred, construction disputes can be resolved with higher transparency and dramatic savings in effort, time, and cost.},

 abstract = {Decentralization is a central characteristic of biological motor control that allows for fast responses relying on local sensory information. In contrast, the current trend of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches to motor control follows a centralized paradigm using a single, holistic controller that has to untangle the whole input information space. This motivates to ask whether decentralization as seen in biological control architectures might also be beneficial for embodied sensori-motor control systems when using DRL. To answer this question, we provide an analysis and comparison of eight control architectures for adaptive locomotion that were derived for a four-legged agent, but with their degree of decentralization varying systematically between the extremes of fully centralized and fully decentralized. Our comparison shows that learning speed is significantly enhanced in distributed architectures—while still reaching the same high performance level of centralized architectures—due to smaller search spaces and local costs providing more focused information for learning. Second, we find an increased robustness of the learning process in the decentralized cases—it is less demanding to hyperparameter selection and less prone to becoming trapped in poor local minima. Finally, when examining generalization to uneven terrains—not used during training—we find best performance for an intermediate architecture that is decentralized, but integrates only local information from both neighboring legs. Together, these findings demonstrate beneficial effects of distributing control into decentralized units and relying on local information. This appears as a promising approach towards more robust DRL and better generalization towards adaptive behavior.},

 abstract = {Centralization has become a de facto standard for implementing networked environments such as the Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS). Though easy to implement and control, centralized systems are difficult and expensive to scale in terms of the number of devices and the flow of information. This set of circumstances calls for a decentralized and distributed architecture for realizing such networked systems. However, due to the absence of global information in decentralized systems, one of the primary challenges is to find the best solution for problems distributed across the devices which are part of the CPS. Since the problems are distributed and no participating device has access to the full information, the devices may need to interact and share the information to select the best solution for a problem occurred. In this paper, we present a decentralized and distributed mechanism, which adapts to a stream of varying problems and continuously evolves and learns the best mappings between the problems and their associated solutions. The proposed approach integrates the concepts propounded in the three major Immune theories and can cater to real-world situations. The evolved mappings are shared across the physical network, thereby accelerating the search for the best set of solutions. In order to validate the performance of the proposed mechanism, we present the results obtained from solving a problem of sorting a stream of varying data in an emulated decentralized and distributed manner. To substantiate its working in real-world scenarios, we also describe the results obtained by embodying the system in real robots that discover the best path-following algorithms.},

 abstract = {As the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) grows within the field of cybersecurity, so too does the demand for secure and decentralized AI systems to protect against potential cyber threats. Blockchain technology (BT) has emerged as the ideal approach for increasing both the security and privacy of AI systems since it provides decentralized and immutable data storage. This systematic literature review focuses on the integration of BT with decentralized AI within cybersecurity. It provides a comprehensive taxonomy of BT and decentralized AI for cybersecurity serving as the starting point for the study. This paper begins with an overview of BT and its possible uses in cybersecurity and also analyzes its challenges and opportunities. Decentralized AI is also covered in the study, along with its potential advantages and difficulties in decentralized AI cybersecurity. Building on that foundation, this study provides convincing findings highlighting the beneficial relationships between BT and decentralized AI for cybersecurity, contributing to a nuanced comprehension of their integration. Moreover, it offers real-world uses of blockchain-enabled decentralized AI to discuss its usefulness in tackling cybersecurity concerns. Finally, this paper discusses future research directions for blockchain-enabled decentralized AI in cybersecurity, including potential applications and implications of this technology in the field, emphasizing the potential of blockchain-enabled decentralized AI in cybersecurity to enhance security, privacy, and trust in AI systems.},

 abstract = {In recent years, on the one hand, we have witnessed the rise of blockchain technology, which has led to better transparency, traceability, and therefore, trustworthy exchange of digital assets among different actors. On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.},

 abstract = {While modern software companies strive to increase team autonomy to enable them to successfully operate the piece of software they develop and deploy, efficient ways to orchestrate the work of multiple autonomous teams working in parallel are still poorly understood. In this paper, we report how team autonomy is maintained at Spotify at scale, based on team retrospectives, interviews with team managers and archival analysis of corporate databases and work procedures. In particular, we describe how managerial authority is decentralized through various workgroups with collective authority, what compromises are made to team autonomy to ensure alignment and which team-related factors can further hinder autonomy. Our findings show that scaled autonomy at Spotify does not mean anarchy, or unlimited permissiveness. Instead, squads are expected to take responsibility for their work and coordinate, communicate and align their actions with others, and comply with a few enabling constraints. Further, squads take many decisions independently without management control or due to collective efforts that bypass formal boundary structures. Mechanisms and strategies that enable self-organization at Spotify are related to effective sharing of the codebase, achieving alignment, networking and knowledge sharing, and are described to guide other companies in their efforts to scale autonomy.},

 abstract = {In response to the current situation that Web2 Internet medical giants monopolize data elements and deprive medical users of their data rights and interests, self-sovereign identity(SSI) in the open environment of “Web3+Medicine” will make it possible for users to control and manage their e-medical data independently. However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet. The experimental results show that our scheme can more securely solve the problem of excessive privacy leakage of medical users within a feasible timeframe.},

@article{SONNENSCHEIN201540,
 abstract = {Due to the significant environmental impact of power production from fossil fuels and nuclear fission, future energy systems will increasingly rely on distributed and renewable energy sources (RES). The electrical feed-in from photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind energy converters (WEC) varies greatly both over short and long time periods (from minutes to seasons), and (not only) by this effect the supply of electrical power from RES and the demand for electrical power are not per se matching. In addition, with a growing share of generation capacity especially in distribution grids, the top-down paradigm of electricity distribution is gradually replaced by a bottom-up power supply. This altogether leads to new problems regarding the safe and reliable operation of power grids. In order to address these challenges, the notion of Smart Grids has been introduced. The inherent flexibilities, i.e. the set of feasible power schedules, of distributed power units have to be controlled in order to support demand–supply matching as well as stable grid operation. Controllable power units are e.g. combined heat and power plants, power storage systems such as batteries, and flexible power consumers such as heat pumps. By controlling the flexibilities of these units we are particularly able to optimize the local utilization of RES feed-in in a given power grid by integrating both supply and demand management measures with special respect to the electrical infrastructure. In this context, decentralized systems, autonomous agents and the concept of self-organizing systems will become key elements of the ICT based control of power units. In this contribution, we first show how a decentralized load management system for battery charging/discharging of electrical vehicles (EVs) can increase the locally used share of supply from PV systems in a low voltage grid. For a reliable demand side management of large sets of appliances, dynamic clustering of these appliances into uniformly controlled appliance sets is necessary. We introduce a method for self-organized clustering for this purpose and show how control of such clusters can affect load peaks in distribution grids. Subsequently, we give a short overview on how we are going to expand the idea of self-organized clusters of units into creating a virtual control center for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP) offering products at a power market. For an efficient organization of DVPPs, the flexibilities of units have to be represented in a compact and easy to use manner. We give an introduction how the problem of representing a set of possibly 10100 feasible schedules can be solved by a machine-learning approach. In summary, this article provides an overall impression how we use agent based control techniques and methods of self-organization to support the further integration of distributed and renewable energy sources into power grids and energy markets.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms can be employed to enhance the security of the blockchain networks in the era of industry 4.0. Smart contracts, powered by blockchain, can be developed by using the AI capabilities. These contracts can execute themselves based on predefined conditions, automating various processes and reducing the need for intermediaries. Blockchain provides a transparent and immutable ledger for supply chain transactions. AI can be integrated to analyze this data, providing insights into the entire supply chain. This helps in tracking and tracing products, ensuring authenticity, and optimizing the supply chain based on data-driven decisions. AI algorithms can be employed to analyze data from the manufacturing process recorded on the blockchain. This allows for predictive maintenance and quality control, helping to identify and address issues before they result in defects or downtime. AI and blockchain can work together to secure the massive amount of data generated by IoT devices in an Industry 4.0 setting. Blockchain ensures the integrity and immutability of IoT data, while AI can analyze this data for insights and optimization. AI and blockchain can facilitate the creation of decentralized energy grids where AI algorithms optimize energy distribution and blockchain ensures transparent and secure energy trading through smart contracts. AI and blockchain can support decentralized and collaborative manufacturing networks where different entities can securely and efficiently collaborate on production processes. Blockchain enables individuals or organizations to securely monetize their data. AI can help analyze and determine the value of data, ensuring fair compensation in tokenized ecosystems. In this paper, applications of AI-Powered Blockchain Technology in Industry 4.0 is reviewed and discussed and future research works are also suggested.

But how might project management supported by blockchain technology look like? And how would such a new form change and affect traditional project management? Not many concepts have been designed or even implemented yet. We chose an experimental framework to answer the first aspects of these questions. We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.},

Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol.

The paper aims to connect these three aspects of smart manufacturing and proposes that through the application of data-driven modeling, CPPS will aid in transforming manufacturing to become more intuitive and automated. In turn, automated manufacturing will pave the way for the decentralization of manufacturing. Layering blockchain technologies on top of CPPS will ensure the reliability and security of data sharing and integration across decentralized systems.

 abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to facilitate blockchain innovation immersion in accountancy organizations by providing tools that allow organizations to manage the change. The paper approaches blockchain technology (BT) through the lens of organizational change management, with a specific focus at the organization level.
Design/methodology/approach
A hybrid systematic literature review of relevant literature is presented based on recent research papers published in highly ranked scientific journals that capture how accounting organizations might manage the changes induced by BT.
Findings
The findings of the review indicate that implementing BT requires some new modus operandi. From individual behavior to organizational structure, the advantages of blockchain must be emphasized in all accounting and auditing organizations. Managers should forge a plan that takes advantage of employees' skills, competencies and talent, implementing forward-looking company procedures and actively deciding how to navigate workplace dynamics, personalities and responsibilities.
Research limitations/implications
The main limitations of the study refer to the infancy of the BT and require the development of knowledge through future studies to allow a more accurate outline of the overall picture and a detailed one of the BT phenomena with applicability to accounting and auditing. At this stage, it is not yet possible to fully envision the implications of BT on professional accounting and auditing organizations. However, there will be clients who adopt BTs, so firms should work with them to understand BT-based accounting and auditing applications. That is, accounting and auditing organizations should expand their skills and knowledge to anticipate and meet clients' needs.
Practical implications
In a constantly digitalizing world, the traditional accounting and educational environment is changing but not quickly enough to meet the requirements of a blockchain accounting system yet. For this reason, practical implications on the daily activities of the organizations and the restructuration of their internal architecture have been revealed in this paper.
Originality/value
The paper approaches blockchain using the lens of organizational change management with a specific focus on the accounting and audit organizations, and it proposes solutions to cope with the arising technological challenges. A challenge itself is the implementation of blockchain, especially when an entity is not ready for the process. Therefore, the SWOT analysis elaborated in this paper and focused on the accounting and auditing firms is an element of novelty and at the same time, a helpful tool highlighting the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of this technology, supporting organizations in assessing how ready they are for its adoption. The research on blockchain in accountancy organizations is still necessary for at least seven key areas which have been proposed and detailed at the end of the paper, bringing in this way clarity in regards to the most endorsed avenues for future research directions.},

Blockchain works over the principle of distributed, secured, and shared ledger, which is used to record, and track data within a decentralized network. This technology has successfully replaced certain systems of economic transactions in organizations and has the potential to overtake various industrial business models in future. Blockchain works over peer-to-peer (P2P) phenomenon for its operation and does not require any trusted-third party authorization for data tracking and storage. The information stored in blockchain is distributed throughout the decentralized network and is usually protected using cryptographic hash functions. Since the beginning of blockchain technology, its use in different applications is increasing exponentially, but this increased use has also raised some questions regarding privacy and security of data being stored in it. Protecting privacy of blockchain data using data perturbation strategy such as differential privacy could be a novel approach to overcome privacy issues in blockchain. In this article, we cover the topic of integration of differential privacy in each layer of blockchain and in certain blockchain based scenarios. Moreover, we highlight some future challenges and application scenarios in which integration of differential privacy in blockchain can produce fruitful results.},

 abstract = {Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) technology enables participants to cooperatively train a shared model while preserving the privacy of their local data sets, making it a desirable solution for decentralized and privacy-preserving Web3 scenarios. However, DFL faces incentive and security challenges in the decentralized framework. To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.},

However, few schemes consider both fairness and copyright protection in the current literature. In this paper, we propose a flexible and Ethereum-based scheme to facilitate copyright protection in data sharing blockchain, by using watermark-based policies. This allows us to achieve properties such as preventing the re-selling of data (e.g., partial data, combined data, and leaked data). We also design five algorithms to automatically guarantee data sharing fairness and proactively protect data copyright, by using smart contracts. In other words, several new security features are introduced to existing transaction schemes, while still achieving feasible performance. The response times for each key step of smart contract in the proposed scheme is between 0.41 s and 0.91 s.},

 abstract = {The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has brought forth new challenges to the power grid. Further, the simultaneous charging of EVs could lead to peak demand, potentially causing overloading, voltage swings, and other grid-related problems. To address these issues and lower the high energy costs faced by EV owners and grid operators, EV charging must be optimized. The study proposes an innovative strategy that utilizes decentralized charging systems to lessen the impact of EVs on the grid. A decentralized EV scheduling strategy offers scalability. Thus, making it suitable for a large EV population and it remains resilient to the dynamic arrivals of the EVs. The approach aims to balance the load on the grid and improve the effectiveness of charging operations. To achieve this, a convex optimization problem has been developed to effectively regulate the charging procedure, taking into account the distinct attributes of each EV. The mechanism operates by dividing time into several intervals. Each electric vehicle in the system autonomously adjusts its charging rate during the assigned time slots, with the goal of minimizing individual charging expenses. Moreover, the system demonstrates flexibility in deciding when to charge and discharge, allowing prioritization based on individual EV battery levels and power grid conditions. As a result, the cost analysis was conducted using the number of EVs and the average group size. A comparison of computational times between centralized and decentralized systems was undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the system.},

However, due to the involvement of multiple industrial sectors, a large number of related parties, and the complexity of environmental information flows in the whole lifecycle of buildings, the effectiveness of the traditional centralized management approach is limited, and it is necessary to adopt more advanced management technology tools. With its decentralized, transparent, and secure characteristics, blockchain technology has triggered various applications in several industries, as well as in the field of building environmental sustainability. Using bibliometric and content analysis, this paper comprehensively reviews the current state of research on blockchain technology in the field of building environmental sustainability. A total of 128 articles were reviewed, revealing that blockchain technology has been used to address various types of environmental problems in multiple stages of the building lifecycle, including building material production, construction, operation, and demolition phases, etc. It is shown that blockchain technology can already effectively improve the use of renewable energy and reduce overall energy consumption during the building operation phase, while the great potential for solving other environmental issues, such as the management of building embodied carbon emissions, needs to be further explored. This paper also explores potential research opportunities and future directions based on current gaps and limitations, presenting several critical topics from the perspective of building lifecycle and practice support. This review helps related researchers gain insights into the research frontier and future direction.},

 abstract = {It is concerned that system-level benefits of connected automated vehicle control might only prevail in a far-future centralized control environment, whereas the benefits could be much offset in a near-future decentralized control system. To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.},

 abstract = {The inter-vehicle communication in the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) providing ubiquitous mobility to mobile users is considered an essential component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), enabling a wide range of safety and non-safety applications in which the vehicles seamlessly interact and co-operate with each other. The recent paradigm shift in VANETs protocols has led to the adoption of name data networking (NDN) as an underlying communication protocol in VANETs that replaces traditional address-based communication philosophy, treats content as a first-class citizen, and assigns unique names to contents consequently enabling name-based routing and forwarding, caching, and security. Although NDN has significantly improved the underlying communication issues in VANETs, a plethora of challenges such as message broadcast storms, in-efficient packet suppression mechanisms, intermittent connectivity owing to frequent topological changes, and reverse path partioning (RPP) require further attention from the research community. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes decentralized receiver-based link stability-aware forwarding (DRLSF) protocol. The DRLSF is a beacon-less receiver-based multi-hop protocol, well-suited for pull-based applications where end users request desired data by sending packets. The comparative performance analysis validates the effectiveness of the DRLSF protocol in different VANET environments and application scenarios.},

 abstract = {Identity and access management frameworks address user access rights and data governance for organizations, vendors and users. In response to the problems associated with centralized authorities (e.g. single point of failure, limited scalability, lack of user control), new identity management models have emerged, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which relies on verifiable data registers to validate Decentralized Identifier (DIDs) and can be achieved in many different ways, e.g. through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), distributed databases or other decentralized systems. The main goal of SSI is to enable users to take control of managing their data shared with different services. In this paper, we examine a possible application of the SSI concept to aerial base station (ABS)- integrated networks. The paper presents the effective use of DID implementation to provide a secure and decentralized way to create, associate and verify credentials and identities of ABSs, ensuring secure communication between Ground Base stations (GBSs) and other nodes in the network in a multi-operator scenario. In the numerical results, the average values of various metrics (namely, the average credential presentation time, the average credential offer time, the average DIDcomm connection creation time, the average DIDcomm signing time, and the average DIDcomm revoke credential time) related to credential operations in a DID management system are given for three different number of requests (50 K, 75 K, and 100 K). We have also provided the values of the different status codes that occurred in 100 K operations in the same DID management system. Towards the end of the paper, a comparison is made between SSI-based and Non-fungible token (NFT)-based blockchain solutions, also discussing the challenges and future directions of SSI solutions in the context of ABS-integrated networks.},

 abstract = {Complex deep-space missions containing several tasks are beyond the capacity of a single probe and require multi-probe cooperation. Such missions need onboard planning to avoid communication delays caused by the long distance between the probes and the Earth. However, the traditional centralized planning approaches will burden the manager probe with a high computing load and make the system liable to a single-point failure. A decentralized onboard planning system based on privacy-preserving multi-agent negotiation is proposed to address this problem. The Privacy-preserving Decentralized Multi-Agent Mission Planning Frame (PDMA-MPF) is designed, in which the concepts of private agent and public agent are proposed for the first time. Based on the planning frame, the Decentralized Multi-Agent Iterative Negotiation Task Allocation Method (DMAIN) is developed to allocate tasks and generate local plans for probes. The method uses a deferred-acceptance negotiation pattern, considering the mission profit and load balancing of probes. An information consistency mechanism is designed for the public data synchronization of planners. The local planning of probes is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem with profit optimization. A temporal constraint handling algorithm and a Resource Rate Timeline (RRTL) based resource constraint handling algorithm are proposed to satisfy constraints in a profit optimized way. The planning system verification shows that the proposed system can generate reasonable plans and guarantee public data consistency between planners. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed planning system gets higher mission profits and a more balanced workload of probes, as compared with the traditional Hierarchical Greedy Algorithm.},

 abstract = {With the widespread application of distributed power generation, traditional energy consumers are becoming active prosumers. Giving full play to the role of the electricity market in resource allocation, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading between multiple prosumers and consumers helps increase the revenue of electricity sales and reduce the cost of electricity consumption. The participation of flexible resources in P2P energy trading achieves local power complementarity, improves benefits, and reduces the operating pressure of lines. To ensure the benefits of prosumers and stimulate their enthusiasm, it is necessary to propose an effective trading strategy to fully allow flexible resources to participate in P2P energy trading. Therefore, this paper establishes a P2P energy market based on the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) theory, we propose a minimum cost rolling optimization model to optimize the bidding quantity of flexible resources. Moreover, the Automatic Learning (AL) pricing strategy with privacy and learning is proposed. The AL bidding price strategy enables interactive learning among prosumers. In addition, the influence of bidding price on bidding quantity during the trading process is also considered. Furthermore, this paper considers the impact of renewable energy source (RES) uncertainty on the bidding decisions of prosumers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by the simulation results of cases. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the benefits for prosumers, enhance the local balance ability, achieve price learning, and increase the transaction rate.},
