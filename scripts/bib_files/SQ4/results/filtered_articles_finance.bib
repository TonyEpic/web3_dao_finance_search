 abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

 abstract = {The paper discusses the influence exerted by financial systems on the change of the financial sector and its further development. The study is relevant since there is need for building up more trust in blockchain. In the course of the research, the main trends of decentralized financial systems were identified and presented, including the problems related to decentralized financial systems and options for resolving them. The study is aimed at defining the problems and searching for ways to tackle them when regulating decentralized finances (DeFi) in order to ensure effective regulation on the part of the Central Bank and control risks. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, DeFi, in fact, has to be regulated so as to achieve its main decentralization goal. In addition, DeFi presents a potential possibility for developing a fairly new regulation method: the idea of “integrated regulation”. The paper considers various approaches to regulation, which can be integrated in the DeFi design. It can potentially lead to the decentralization of both finance and its regulation, which eventually expresses RegTech (Regulatory Technology), which is used by financial organizations for being able to meet the requirements of the regulator more easily. The study defines the problems that are encountered in the course of using DeFi and points out the possible ways for dealing with them, including a way for switching to blockchain independently so that the transaction is not charged in ETH for calculation on blockchain; reducing the complexity and costs of use and understanding of DeFi software by most users. A whole lot of risks that decentralized financial protocols are susceptible to is analyzed: vulnerabilities in the code security of smart contracts, their stacking and layout; oracle risk, which is subject to manipulation in the process of data transfer; the financial risk of high volatility, regulatory risk and crisis of the global economy due to the inability to predict in which way the Covid-19 pandemic is going to be resolved.},

 abstract = {We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks — and, thereby, DeFi protocols — would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.},

 abstract = {The threshold digital signature technique is important for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as asset custody and cross-chain interoperations. The Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) is widely used in blockchains, e.g., Libra/Diem; however, no suitable threshold solution exists. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a threshold EdDSA that allows n parties to generate keys in a decentralized and distributed manner. Any t + 1-of-n parties can generate standard EdDSA signatures. This scheme supports an arbitrary threshold (t, n) and has been proven to be secure against at most t malicious adversaries. The theoretical analysis (computation complexity and communication footprints) and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs efficiently on cloud servers and embedded devices. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is integrated with Tendermint, a blockchain framework that uses EdDSA, to generate keys and sign transactions in a decentralized manner, which indicates that this scheme is compatible with blockchains for supporting DeFi applications.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions.

The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.},

 abstract = {Web3, the next generation web, promises a decentralized and democratized internet that puts users in control of their data and online identities. However, Web3 faces significant challenges, including scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and energy consumption. To address these challenges, this review paper provides a comprehensive analysis of Web3, including its key advancements and implications, as well as an overview of its major applications in Decentralized Applications (DApps), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and Supply Chain Management and Provenance Tracking. The paper also discusses the potential social and economic impact of Web3, as well as its integration with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart cities. This article then discusses importance of zero-trust architecture for Web3. Ultimately, this review highlights the importance of Web3 in shaping the future of the internet and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.},

@article{SUN2024101286,
 abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.},
