 abstract = {Bugs severely hurt blockchain system dependability. A thorough understanding of blockchain bug characteristics is required to design effective tools for preventing, detecting and mitigating bugs. We perform an empirical study on bug characteristics in eight representative open source blockchain systems. First, we manually examine 1,108 bug reports to understand the nature of the reported bugs. Second, we leverage card sorting to label the bug reports, and obtain ten bug categories in blockchain systems. We further investigate the frequency distribution of bug categories across projects and programming languages. Finally, we study the relationship between bug categories and bug fixing time. The findings include: (1) semantic bugs are the dominant runtime bug category; (2) frequency distributions of bug types show similar trends across different projects and programming languages; (3) security bugs take the longest median time to be fixed; (4) 35.71\% performance bugs are fixed in more than one year; performance bugs take the longest average time to be fixed.},

 abstract = {Recent blockchain-technology related innovations enable the governance of collaborating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to engage in agile business-network collaborations that are based on the novel concept of smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely coupled collaboration lifecycle with the main steps of setup, enactment, possible rollbacks and finally, an orderly termination. This lifecycle supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs, smart contract negotiations, and behavior monitoring during enactment with the potential for breach management. Based on a sound understanding of the collaboration lifecycle in a Governance- as-a-Service (GaaS)-platform, a new type of conflict management must safeguard business-semantics induced consistency rules. This conflict management involves breach detection with recovery aspects. To fill the detected gap, we employ a formal design-notation that comprises the definition of structural and behavioral properties for exploring conflict-related exception- and compensation management during a decentralized collaboration. With the formal approach, we generate a highly dependable DAO-GaaS conflict model that does not collapse under left-behind clutter such as orphaned processes and exponentially growing database entries that require an unacceptable periodic GaaS reset.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

However, since interoperability and scalability, due to high and capped (in particular cases) transaction latency are deep-rooted in the architecture of blockchain technology, they are by default inherited in any blockchain based applications. Lightning Network (LN) is one of the supporting technologies developed to eliminate this impediment of blockchain technology by facilitating instantaneous transfers of cryptos. Since the potentials of LN is still relatively unknown, this paper investigates the current states of development along with possible non-monetary usage of LN, especially in settlement coloured coins such as securities, as well as creation of new business models based on Lightning Applications (LApps) and microchannel payments as well as micro-trades. The legal challenges that may act as impediment to the adoption of LN is also discussed.},

 abstract = {Traditional Blockchain Sharding approaches can only tolerate up to n/3 of nodes being adversary because they rely on the hyper-geometric distribution to make a failure (an adversary does not have n/3 of nodes globally but can manipulate the consensus of a Shard) hard to happen. The system must maintain a large Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low failure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this paper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up to n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and every Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that this design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one class) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more Shards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The improved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation for decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.},

Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

As a distributed, immutable, and partly public ledger, the consortium blockchain demonstrates its potential to enable trustworthy interoperability and collaboration between organizations. However, the mismatch between the unruled software engineering practices and the increased interest of the consortium blockchain technology may pose threats to the quality of systems implemented. To mitigate the possible threats, this study takes the angle of software engineering to systematically understand the challenges and possible solutions in terms of developing and operating a consortium blockchain-based system. For this purpose, we conducted a case study on a typical consortium blockchain-based system and exhaustively collected the data by two rounds in-depth interviews on practitioners of different roles in the case project. Based on the data analysis, eight pairs of challenges and potential solutions were identified, which cover the phases of the development and operation of consortium blockchains. Moreover, we also captured two implications after further analysis of the findings, which worth the special attention of researchers in the near future, i.e. DevOps and microservices for blockchain or smart contracts.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has enabled a thriving emergent ecosystem of tools and communities actively using decentralized systems. However, most blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum) requires users to pay some fees to execute their desired actions in these novel online services. To which extent an increase in the price of such fees negatively affects user activity? Would significant price surges deter users from using blockchain-enabled online services? In this work, we study the 2020 surge of transaction fee price in the Ethereum network, and analyze how that affected user activities. Our use cases are the blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from the platforms DAOstack and DAOhaus. Thus, we analyzed 5,580 transactions from 7,825 users grouped in 191 DAO communities, using a VAR model with a daily time series of the average fee value and the DAO operations. Our results show just a minor influence of the fee (gas) price and the activity of DAO users. The insensitivity of the activity to the fee price is an anomaly in a supposedly self-regulated market, and we consider this should be tackled in future implementations.},

Despite the endless potentials of the DLTs, they are still in infant stage and at the same time having a number of risks that may deter its future integration and use.

To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized for future research directions. We hope this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.},

Although many academic communities were initially slow to grasp the technology's numerous potential implications, meanwhile a substantial amount of research is dedicated to investigating the development and impact of blockchain and related technologies. As undertaken, most research projects take a specific homogenous perspective, such as a technical or business viewpoint. To date, blockchain research studies are largely missing a bridge between and across academic disciplines. Given the manifold implications of blockchain technology, a fruitful crossdisciplinary exchange is therefore needed. In this paper, we bring together researchers with varying expertise to provide a vision into what may be next in terms of concepts, applications, and research agendas. We consider business, economic, societal, legal, technical, and philosophical viewpoints and propose multiple research questions as well as hypotheses arising from these diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, we challenge various academic communities to tackle some of the most crucial issues of current blockchain research and to develop a solid foundation for future exploration.},

 abstract = {The construction industry is a $6 trillion industry worldwide with a prediction to grow towards $10,3 trillion by 2023 and constitutes an essential part of the global economy. Nevertheless, the management of the construction effort is still very manual. The construction process from design, to sourcing of material, contract management, and so on, is a convoluted and intransparent process filled with risks the collaborating parties are exposed to. A need exists for management platforms that streamline and automate collaborative construction processes, establish transparency, traceability, and information symmetry between business parties. This paper presents the Construction Project Management (CoPM) platform that is based on blockchain- and smart-contract technologies for enabling peer-to-peer collaboration between construction parties that enhances the flow of information for reducing cost- and time expenditures while improving the quality of service. The CoPM system is based on diligent up-front requirement studies from which we derive a coherent system architecture and set of cooperation protocols. Thereby, the CoPM system overcomes the currently existing fractured value propositions for construction-management systems.CCS Concepts •Software and its engineering•Software creation and management•Designing software},

 abstract = {In recent years, the proliferation of blockchain technology has opened many research directions. In this context, the combination of blockchain-based techniques and traditional methods to improve existing systems has received significant interest from researchers. In this paper, we present a decentralized storage and sharing system based on a combination of IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System), encryption technologies (including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC), ABE (Attribute-based Encryption), Multi-Authority ABE (MA-ABE)), and multichain. In particular, we facilitate the advantages of the IPFS network to store user's data in a distributed manner. Furthermore, we make use of a cryptographer to protect the privacy of data. The hash returned by the IPFS network will be stored in our multichain architecture to provide transparency for all users participating in the system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first storage and sharing system using IPFS, cryptographer, and multichain to ensure decentralized, trustworthy, transparent characteristics for storing and sharing data.},

 abstract = {Recently, a new generation of P2P systems capable of addressing data integrity and authenticity has emerged for the development of new applications for a "more" decentralized Internet, i.e., Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and Decentralized File Systems (DFS). However, these technologies still have some unanswered issues, mostly related to data lookup and discovery. In this paper, first, we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system that efficiently manages decentralized keyword-based queries executed on data stored in DFS. Through a hypercube logical layout, queries are efficiently routed among the network, where each node is responsible for a specific keywords set and the related contents. Second, we provide a framework for the governance of the above network, based on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implementation. We show how the use of smart contracts enables organizational decision making and rewards for nodes that have actively contributed to the DHT. Finally, we provide experimental validation of an implementation of our proposal, where the execution of the same protocol for different logical nodes of the hypercube allows us to evaluate the efficiency of communication within the network.},

 abstract = {This piece explores algorithmic governance as a strength and a vulnerability in the experience of building participatory communities known as "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations". The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation and built cryptographically secure blockchain-based infrastructure to counter this threat. Now, not just on chain transactions are being tracked but every move of participants in blockchain communities. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if mis-used for social control. This piece analyzes the ways in which decentralization efforts can be a threat to themselves by exploring the question, 'Are "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) the next panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in "autonomous" systems?'. By employing ethnographic methods and case study analysis, this piece provides an important qualitative contribution to the early dynamics of the aspirations and problems of decentralized, autonomous organizations.},

 abstract = {Blockchain, a potentially disruptive technology, advances many different applications, e.g., crypto-currencies, supply chains, and the Internet of Things. Under the hood of blockchain, it is required to handle different kinds of digital assets and data. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of numerous applications, and each application may have a distinct representation of digital assets. However, digital assets cannot be directly recorded on the blockchain, and a tokenization process is required to format these assets. Tokenization on blockchain will inevitably require a certain level of proper standards to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. However, due to specific features of digital assets, it is hard to obtain a standard token form to represent all kinds of assets. For example, when considering fungibility, some assets are divisible and identical, commonly referred to as fungible assets. In contrast, others that are not fungible are widely referred to as non-fungible assets. When tokenizing these assets, we are required to follow different tokenization processes. The way to effectively tokenize assets is thus essential and expecting to confront various unprecedented challenges. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive study of the current progress of tokenization on blockchain. First, we explore general principles and practical schemes to tokenize digital assets for blockchain and classify digitized tokens into three categories: fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible. We then focus on discussing the well-known Ethereum standards on non-fungible tokens. Finally, we discuss several critical challenges and some potential research directions to advance the research on exploring the tokenization process on the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study for tokenization on blockchain.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, Online Social Media (OSM) are among the most popular web services. Traditional OSM are known to be affected by serious issues including misinformation, fake news, censorship, and privacy violations, to the point that a pressing demand for new paradigms is raised by users all over the world. Among such paradigms, the concepts around the Web 3.0 are fueling a new revolution of online sociality, pushing towards the adoption of innovative and groundbreaking technologies. In particular, the decentralization of social services through the blockchain technology is representing the most valid alternative to current OSM, enabling the development of rewarding strategies for value redistribution, and fake news detection. However, the so-called Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSMs) are far from being mature, with different platforms that continually try to redefine their services in order to attract larger audiences, thus causing blockchain forks and massive user migrations, with the latter dominating the dynamics of the current OSM landscape, too. In this paper, we deal with the evolution of BOSMs from the perspective of user migration across platforms as a consequence of a fork event. We propose a general user migration model applicable to BOSMs to represent the evolution patterns of fork-based migrations, the multi-interaction structural complexity of BOSMs, and their growth characteristics. Within this framework, we also cope with the task of predicting how users will behave in the case of a fork, i.e. they will remain on the original blockchain or they will migrate to the new one. We apply our framework to the case study of the Steem-Hive fork event, and show the importance of considering both social and economic information, regardless of the learning algorithm considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on blockchain fork and its related user migration.},

 abstract = {In data-intensive workloads, data placement and memory management are inherently difficult: the programmer and the operating system have to choose between (combinations of) DRAM and storage, replacement policies, as well as paging sizes. Efficient memory management is based on fine-grained data access patterns driving placement decisions. Current solutions in this space cannot be applied to general workloads and production systems due to either unrealistic assumptions or prohibitive monitoring overheads.To overcome these issues, we introduce DAOS, an open-source system for general data access-aware memory management. DAOS provides a data access monitoring framework that utilizes practical best-effort trade-offs between overhead and accuracy. The memory management engine of DAOS allows users to implement their access-aware management with no code, just simple configuration schemes. For system administrators, DAOS provides a runtime system that auto-tunes the schemes for user-defined objectives in a finite time. We evaluated DAOS on commercial service production systems as well as state-of-the-art benchmarks. DAOS achieves up to 12\% performance improvement and 91\% memory saving. DAOS is upstreamed and available in the Linux kernel.},

The projects use design and HCI methods to relate blockchains to a range of topics, including global supply chains, delivery infrastructure, smart grids, volunteering and charitable giving, through engaging public, exploring ideas and speculating on possible futures. Based on an extensive annotated portfolio we draw out learning for the design of blockchain systems, broadening participation and surfacing questions around imaginaries, social implications and engagement with new technology.

In this research, we introduce Decentralized Autonomous Citizen Participation Organizations (DACPOs). In a DACPO, data and actions are recorded and autonomously executed in a decentralized way. DACPOs can be used for enabling participative budgeting and thereby provide transparency, decrease the risks of fraud and corruption, and increase citizens’ trust.

In this paper, we describe early findings from the development of a card-based approach for engaging the public in the design of DAOs for collectively governing health data. Following a public workshop, we reflect on how our methodological approach involved laypeople in practical discussions about DAO design elements, such as voting mechanisms. Through group conversations, we observed how values affected the kinds of decentralised organisational structures participants wished to engage in. In particular, our analysis has implications for the future directions of DAO design, by pointing towards flexibility and modularity for voting and proposal interfaces, scalability and balancing power in tokenised communities.},

 abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) or blockchains have been steadily emerging and providing innovation in the past decade for several use cases, ranging from financial networks, to notarization, or trustworthy execution via smart contracts. DLTs are enticing due to their properties of decentralization, non-repudiation, and auditability (transparency). These properties are of high potential to access control systems that can be implemented on-chain, and are executed without infringement and full transparency.While it remains uncertain which use cases will truly turn out to be viable, many use cases such as financial transactions can benefit from integrating certain restrictions via access control on the blockchain. In addition, smart contracts may in the future present security risks that are currently yet unknown. As a solution, access control policies can provide flexibility in the execution flow when adopted by smart contracts.In this paper, we present our DEDACS architecture which provides decentralized and dynamic access control for smart contracts in a policy-based manner. Our access control is expressive as it features policies, and dynamic as the environment or users can be changed, or alternative policies can be assigned to smart contracts. DEDACS ensures that our access control preserves the desired properties of decentralization and transparency, while aiming to keep the costs involved as minimal as possible. We have evaluated DEDACS in the context of a Uniswap token-exchange platform, in which we evaluated the costs related to (i) the introduced overhead at deployment time and (ii) the operational overhead cost. DEDACS introduces a relative overhead of on average 52\% at deployment time, and an operational overhead between 52\% and 80\% depending on the chosen policy and its complexity.},

 abstract = {Blockchain games introduce unique gameplay and incentive mechanisms by allowing players to be rewarded with in-game assets or tokens through financial activities. However, most blockchain games are not comparable to traditional games in terms of lifespan and player engagement. In this paper, we try to see the big picture in a small way to explore and determine the impact of gameplay and financial factors on player behavior in blockchain games. Taking Aavegotchi as an example, we collect one year of operation data to build player profiles. We perform an in-depth analysis of player behavior from the macroscopic data and apply an unsupervised clustering method to distinguish the attraction of the gameplay and incentives. Our results reveal that the whole game is held up by a small number of players with high-frequent interaction or vast amounts of funds invested. Financial incentives are indispensable for blockchain games for they provide attraction and optional ways for players to engage with the game. However, financial services are tightly linked to the free market. The game will face an irreversible loss of players when the market experiences depression. For blockchain games, well-designed gameplay should be the fundamental basis for the long-lasting retention of players.},

 abstract = {Human genomic data carry unique information about an individual and offer unprecedented opportunities for healthcare. The clinical interpretations derived from large genomic datasets can greatly improve healthcare and pave the way for personalized medicine. Sharing genomic datasets, however, poses major challenges, as genomic data is different from traditional medical data, indirectly revealing information about descendants and relatives of the data owner and carrying valid information even after the owner passes away. Therefore, stringent data ownership and control measures are required when dealing with genomic data. In order to provide a secure and accountable infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a promising alternative to traditional distributed systems. Indeed, the research on blockchain-based infrastructures tailored to genomics is on the rise. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the current state-of-the-art methods in the applications of blockchain in genomics. In this article, we systematically look at the existing work both commercial and academic, and discuss the major opportunities and challenges. Our study is driven by five research questions that we aim to answer in our review. We also present our projections of future research directions which we hope the researchers interested in the area can benefit from.},

Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

 abstract = {A blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology where transactions as data state changes are permanently recorded securely and transparently without the need for third parties. Besides, introducing smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability, revolutionizing the software ecosystem toward decentralized applications. Although promising, the usability of smart contracts is primarily limited to on-chain data without access to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events reside. This connectability to off-chain data for smart contracts and blockchain is an open practical problem referred to as the “oracle problem” and is defined as how real-world data can be transferred into/from the blockchain. Hence, Blockchain oracles are introduced and implemented in the form of application programming interfaces connecting the real world to the blockchain for mitigating such a limitation. This article studies and analyzes how blockchain oracles provide final feedback (i.e., outcome) to smart contracts and survey blockchain oracle technologies and mechanisms regarding data integrity and correctness. Since the existing solutions are extensive in terms of characteristics and usage, we investigate their structure and principles by classifying the blockchain oracle implementation techniques into two major groups voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on participants’ stakes for outcome finalization, while the latter considers reputation and performance metrics in conjunction with authenticity-proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We present the result of this classification with a thorough discussion of the state of the art and provide the remaining challenges and future research directions in the end.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

 abstract = {Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model.},

 abstract = {Public auditing and data deduplication are integral considerations in providing efficient and secure cloud storage services. Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open source scale-out storage system that is designed from the ground up to support Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVMe storage in user space. DAOS has demonstrated leadership performance on IO500. But while IO500 has defined an extensive “standard” set of I/O patterns, a single IO500 run does not provide much insight into how a storage solution scales. This paper investigates the performance scaling behavior of the DAOS storage stack for typical IOR and mdtest workloads, as a function of the storage server hardware and the client-side parallelism.

These systems aim at empowering the local economies by virtue of a medium of exchange whose governance and circulation are local. Smart contracts enable the enforcement of token economy policies, which facilitate the experimentation of radically new economic models. Recent studies investigated blockchain-based CCSs. Still, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing a CCS providing a token-based Universal Basic Income (UBI). We evaluate the Circles UBI decentralised application utility in delivering an unconditional income to its users, focusing on its main pilot project running in Berlin. We analyse the structural changes in the network, especially in relation to a subsidy program, involving local businesses. We also identify prominent users based on centrality measures, and investigate how the UBI was effectively spent. We adopt a method agnostic to the economic context to identify optimal aggregation windows for the temporal network of CCS transactions based on the Causal Fidelity (CF) index. This aims to provide static representations as accurate as possible in terms of sequential order of edges, which aspect was not considered in previous research on CCSs. Our findings suggest that the pilot project sustained the expansion of the economic network and the system facilitated trade in urban communities in Berlin. Future research is needed to identify methods to ensure sustainability of self-organised CCSs adopting a UBI issuance scheme and to further decentralise their governance.},

 abstract = {The growing popularity of online social media (OSM) has led to the creation of a wide amount of social media platforms. In this context, the increasing competition among platforms and the emergence of decentralized alternatives such as Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM), have led to more frequent user migrations: individuals tend to switch platforms in search of improved features, content, or communities. Therefore there has been increasing interest in user migration studies modeling and predicting user migration. However, user migration, especially in blockchain-based platforms remains an understudied problem. Existing methods rely on user activity to derive interaction graphs and then address the user migration prediction problem as a node classification task, where user decisions are encoded as node labels. While the performance look promising, there are currently two important research gaps: i) there is no work using graph neural networks, the state-of-the-art in machine learning on graphs; and ii) there is a lack of methods designed to improve prediction performance in the case of class imbalance, i.e. the presence of dominant behavior among the ones to predict. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict user migration in BOSM. We model the data as a directed temporal multilayer graph, capturing social and monetary interactions among users. To address the problem of class imbalance in node classification, we introduce a data-level balancing technique following an undersampling approach. The evaluation, conducted on data describing user migration across blockchain online social media platforms, shows that graph neural networks are a suitable machine learning approach to perform user migration prediction. Furthermore, the proposed undersampling approach improves predictive power on severely imbalanced data. These results highlight how graph neural networks are effective in predicting user migration, without the need for manual feature engineering and in the absence of user information. Our methodology holds potential for applications beyond user migration, such as fraud detection and bot detection, and opens up venues for further research in other prediction tasks in online social networks and blockchain-based systems.},

However, gathering such massive datasets still remains a critical challenge in the AI service engineering pipeline, especially in the computer vision domain where labeled data is scarce. Rather than isolated data collection, crowdsourcing techniques have shown promising potential to achieve the data collection task in a time and cost-efficient manner. In the existing crowdsourcing marketplaces, the crowd works to fulfill consumer-defined requirements where in the end consumer gains the data ownership and the crowd is compensated with task-based payment. On the contrary, this work proposes a blockchain-based decentralized marketplace named Vision Sovereignty Data Marketplace (ViSDM), in which the crowd works to fulfill global requirements \&amp; holds data ownership, the consumers pay a certain data price to perform a computing task (model training/testing), the data price is distributed among the crowd in a one-to-many manner through smart contracts, thus allowing the crowd to gain profit from each consumer transaction occurring on their data. The marketplace is implemented as multiple smart contracts and is evaluated based on blockchain-transaction gas fees for the stakeholder interaction \&amp; by running scenarios-based simulations.

To enhance smart contracts intelligence on the blockchain, we propose SMART, a plug-in smart contract framework that supports efficient AI model inference while being compatible with existing blockchains. To handle the high complexity of model inference, we propose an on-chain and off-chain joint execution model, which separates the SMART contract into two parts: the deterministic code still runs inside an on-chain virtual machine, while the complex model inference is offloaded to off-chain compute nodes. To solve the non-determinism brought by model inference, we leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to endorse the integrity and correctness of the off-chain execution. We also design distributed attestation and secret key provisioning schemes to further enhance the system security and model privacy. We implement a SMART prototype and evaluate it on a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchain. Theoretical analysis and prototype evaluation show that SMART not only achieves the security goals of correctness, liveness, and model privacy, but also has approximately 5 orders of magnitude faster inference efficiency than existing on-chain solutions.},

This paper presents the first census-like quantitative analysis of the whole ecosystem of DAOs, including 30K DAO communities on the main DAO platforms. This enables us to provide insights into the allegedly "democratic'' nature of DAOs, building metrics concerning their lifespan, participation, and power concentration. Most DAOs have a short lifespan and low participation. There is also a positive correlation between community size and voting power concentration. Like other online communities, DAOs seem to follow the iron law: becoming increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Still, a significant amount of DAOs of varying sizes defy this idea by being egalitarian by design.},

 abstract = {The integration of bots in Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) fosters efficiency and automation. However, their use is also associated with predatory trading and market manipulation, and can pose threats to system integrity. It is therefore essential to understand the extent of bot deployment in DLTs; despite this, current detection systems are predominantly rule-based and lack flexibility. In this study, we present a novel approach that utilizes machine learning for the detection of financial bots on the Ethereum platform. First, we systematize existing scientific literature and collect anecdotal evidence to establish a taxonomy for financial bots, comprising 7 categories and 24 subcategories. Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human and 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The highest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an average cluster purity of 82.6\%, while the highest-performing model for binary classification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83\%. Our machine learning-based detection mechanism contributes to understanding the Ethereum ecosystem dynamics by providing additional insights into the current bot landscape.},

Various improvements and implementations have been made to strengthen smart contract security, including developing scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, both open-source and commercial. These tools were met with varying degrees of success, with some thriving well while others have since stagnated. In this paper, we conducted case studies on six of these tools, three of which are highly regarded and still used today, while the other three have either limited success or have been deprecated. We identified three short-term (6 months or less) and five medium-term (6 to 24 months) factors affecting the tools’ successes. Based on our analysis, we outlined a framework with these factors for potential developers to consider for increasing the success of their projects.},

 abstract = {Remote voting has become more critical in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. Blockchain technology and its benefits such as decentralization, security, and transparency have given rise to proposals for blockchain-based voting systems. However, the traceability of blockchain transactions violates voter anonymity in existing proposals. Besides, transaction costs also need to be considered. Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89\% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at .},

 abstract = {The Metaverse, envisioned as the next-generation Internet, will be constructed via twining a practical world in a virtual form, wherein Meterverse service providers (MSPs) are required to collect massive data from Meterverse users (MUs). In this regard, a critical demand exists for MSPs to motivate MUs to contribute computing resources and data while preserving user privacy. Federated learning (FL), as a privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning paradigm, can support distributed intensive computation in the Metaverse. In this work, we first investigate minting the machine learning models into NFT with FL assistance (referred to as FL-NFT), such that MUs as stakeholders can control the ownership and share the economic value of user-generated content (UGC). Specifically, MUs are encouraged to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (i.e., MU-DAO) to aggregate local models and mint FL-NFT. MUs and MSPs optimize the strategies by formulating an imperfect information Stackelberg game to trade off the cost and benefit. We apply the backward induction to derive the equilibrium solution. Then, we construct a privacy-preserving multi-winner sealed-bid auction mechanism (PMS-AM), in which the Hidden Markov Model assists MSPs in choosing rational bidding strategies according to historical bids, and the double auction mechanism determines the winners and price of FL-NFT. Finally, the numerical results based on theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed PMS-AM can increase the quality of FL-NFT and achieve the economic properties of incentive mechanisms such as individual rationality and incentive compatibility.},

In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.  We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off.

As AI expands into almost every aspect of our lives, people raise serious concerns about AI misbehaving and misuse. To address this concern, international organizations have put forward ethics guidelines for constructing trustworthy AI (TAI), including privacy, transparency, fairness, robustness, accountability, and so on. However, because of the black-box characteristics and complex models of AI systems, it is challenging to translate these guiding principles and aspirations into AI systems. Blockchain, an important decentralized technology, can provide the capabilities of transparency, traceability, immutability, and secure sharing and hence can be used to make AI trustworthy. In this paper, we survey studies on blockchain-based TAI (BTAI) from a software development lifecycle view. We classify the lifecycle of BTAI into four stages: Planning, data collection, model development, and system deployment/use. Particularly, we investigate and summarize the trustworthy issues that blockchain can achieve in the latter three stages, including (1) data transparency, privacy, and accountability; (2) model transparency, privacy, robustness, and fairness; and (3) robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness of system deployment/use. Finally, we present essential open research issues and future work on developing BTAI systems.},

Indeed, DAOs are decentralized organizations, where the members implement their decisions using smart contracts. In the article, we introduce a simple framework for a DAO, and then we discuss some governance issues. In particular, we focus on how DAO members could be induced to dedicate sufficient time to voting sessions, for a proper functioning of the organization. Indeed, recent empirical research suggests how the members’ participation rate, to voting activities, has a meaningful positive correlation with to a DAO's performance. More specifically, we formalize the notion of attention time and propose a simple model for the so-called Holographic Consensus, a protocol introduced by the DAOStack platform to solve the issue of limited time dedicated to governance, discussing under what conditions DAO members may choose the so-called boosting voting procedure.},

However, current anonymous credential systems confront two primary challenges: 1) Their designs are not tailored for resource-limited devices due to their dependence on computationally heavy techniques such as generic zero-knowledge or Groth-Sahai proofs at both presentation and verification phases; and 2) They pose complexities in deploying anonymous credentials as-a-service since users must maintain specific key materials and dedicated software. To tackle these challenges, we present SilentProof, a blockchain-backed anonymous authentication protocol, which offloads the responsibility of credential presentation from individual users to the blockchain. By harnessing the combined strengths of zero-knowledge proxy re-identification and blind signatures, SilentProof empowers the blockchain to create zero-knowledge proofs for users, while ensuring clear user consent and eliminating the need for direct access to user-specific attributes. This design broadens the use cases for anonymous credentials, making it ideal for scalable, secure, and privacy-centric authentication, especially for resource-limited clients. Furthermore, SilentProof lays the groundwork for a new era of privacy-preserving identity management as-a-service. We provide rigorous security proofs to validate our approach and have developed a SilentProof prototype, showcasing the protocol's practical efficiency.},

Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

 abstract = {Authentication and Session Key Generation Protocols (SKGPs) play an essential role in securing the communication channels of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Recently, through blockchain integration, scholars have tried to enhance the security and applicability of SKGPs. In brief, blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can provide interesting features such as immutability, transparency, and accountability without any need for the active participation of trusted parties. This survey presents a comprehensive critical review of blockchain-assisted authentication and SKGPs, suggested for different IoT domains, including Internet of Vehicles, Internet of Drones, and Industrial IoT. Our survey categorizes existing schemes based on several criteria, including IoT application domains, security aspects, and blockchain components. By presenting an unbiased critical review and taxonomy of protocols, we aim to clarify the key challenges. Our review will specifically indicate what properties authors gained or lost through the integration of blockchain. To our best knowledge, this survey is the only one that offers all prerequisites for interested readers in blockchain-integrated SKGPs, such as security features and attacks, attack models, verification tools, blockchain types, blockchain platforms, and consensus mechanisms. Further, our survey elaborates existing research gaps in blockchain-assisted SKGPs. In doing so, we aim to guide future research in this field and provide researchers with the essential information they require.},

 abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are powerful platforms for vehicular data services and applications. The increasing number of vehicles has made the vehicular network diverse, dynamic, and large-scale, making it difficult to meet the 5G network’s demanding requirements. Decentralized systems are interesting and provide attractive services because they are publicly available (transparency), have an append-only ledger (robust integrity protection), remove single points of failure, and enable distributed key management and communication in a peer-to-peer network. Researchers dedicated substantial efforts to advancing vehicle communications, however conventional cryptographic mechanisms are insufficient which enabled us to look at decentralized technologies. Therefore, we revisit decentralized approaches with VANETs. Endpoint devices hold a wallet which may incorporate threshold key management methods like MPC wallets, HD Wallets, or multi-party threshold ECDSA/EdDSA/BLS. We also discuss trust management approaches and demonstrate how decentralization can improve integrity, security, privacy, and resilience to single points of failure. We also conduct a comprehensive review, comparing them with current requirements, and the latest authentication and secure communication architectures, which require the involvement of trusted but non-transparent authorities in certificate issuance/revocation. We highlight the limitations of these schemes from PKI deployment and recommend future research, particularly in the realm of quantum cryptography.},

 abstract = {Spatial crowdsourcing leverages the widespread use of mobile devices to outsource tasks to a crowd of users based on their geographical location. Despite its growing popularity, current crowdsourcing systems often suffer from a lack of transparency, centralization, and other security issues. Blockchain technology has revolutionized this sector with its potential for decentralization, security, and transparency. However, existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing systems often overlook efficient task assignment mechanisms and expose users to potential losses due to the obligatory deposit payments to smart contracts, which might be vulnerable or untrustworthy.This article proposes EDF-Crowd, an Efficient and Deposit-Free blockchain-based spatial crowdsoucing framework, to address these challenges. EDF-Crowd introduces an efficient, customizable task assignment mechanism based on smart contracts, operating periodically and batch-wise. We also design a fair compensation mechanism to compensate users for the extra overhead caused by invoking certain smart contracts. More importantly, we propose a series of linkage protocols. By linking users’ back-and-forth actions, EDF-Crowd can regulate user behavior without requiring users to deposit. The versatility of EDF-Crowd also allows its application to generic crowdsourcing systems with minimal modifications. We implement EDF-Crowd based on the EOS blockchain. Extensive evaluations show that EDF-Crowd achieves high task assignment efficiency and low cost.},

To comprehensively examine blockchain systems, this article presents both a macro-level overview on the most popular blockchain systems, and a micro-level analysis on a general blockchain framework and its crucial components. The macro-level exploration provides a big picture on the endeavors made by blockchain professionals over the years to enhance the blockchain performance while the micro-level investigation details the blockchain building blocks for deep technology comprehension. More specifically, this article introduces a general modular blockchain analytic framework that decomposes a blockchain system into interacting modules and then examines the major modules to cover the essential blockchain components of network, consensus, and distributed ledger at the micro-level. The framework as well as the modular analysis jointly build a foundation for designing scalable, flexible, and application-adaptive blockchains that can meet diverse requirements. Additionally, this article explores popular technologies that can be integrated with blockchain to expand functionality and highlights major challenges. Such a study provides critical insights to overcome the obstacles in designing novel blockchain systems and facilitates the further development of blockchain as a digital infrastructure to service new applications.},

Data volumes have increased by many orders of magnitude over the last 40 years, and are expected to continue to do so, especially given the upcoming adoption of Machine Learning in forecast processes. Parallel POSIX-compliant file systems have been the dominant paradigm in data storage and exchange in HPC workflows for many years. This paper presents ECMWF's move beyond the POSIX paradigm, implementing a backend for their storage library to support DAOS --- a novel high-performance object store designed for massively distributed Non-Volatile Memory. This system is demonstrated to be able to outperform the highly mature and optimised POSIX backend when used under high load and contention, as per typical forecast workflow I/O patterns. This work constitutes a significant step forward, beyond the performance constraints imposed by POSIX semantics.},

 abstract = {This article proposes a novel parallel management mode based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for enterprises by utilizing the artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution (ACP) approach, parallel intelligence theory, and blockchain technologies, to realize the distributed management of an enterprise. The artificial enterprise DAO (EnDAO) corresponding to the actual enterprise is constructed, and they constitute a parallel system via virtual–real interaction and parallel execution. Through the non-fungible token (NFT)-based incentive mechanism, metaverse-based virtual learning and training, as well as DAO-based distributed management and decision-making, the management and control of the actual enterprise as well as its employees can be carried out. By virtue of the virtual–real interactions of three types of employees, as well as the virtual–real feedback of three closed loops in the parallel systems, DAO-based parallel management for enterprises can realize descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence. On this basis, this article takes the recruitment-oriented key performance indicator (KPI) management of a startup technology enterprise as the case to introduce the operation processes and illustrate the superiorities of the proposed DAO-based enterprise parallel management mode.},

Over one billion people use YouTube, a Google corporation, which generates billions of views. YouTube data is being created in extremely large quantities, and with a massive demand to store, analyze, and carefully study large amounts of data to make it usable for big data analytics. For the analysis of these YouTube data, the absence of YouTube Shorts which has become a current trend is the limitation. To address this limitation, YouTube Shorts along with traditional duration videos have been considered for analysis in this work. For analyzing these data, various Machine Learning (ML) techniques like clustering and classification have been considered to categorize the content creators into three different categories such as highly rated, moderately rated and lowly rated. These ratings for recommendation assist content creators in enhancing the value of their brand and the users are benefited by consuming, exchanging shares and promoting the content. The results observed show that the accuracy of the Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting classifiers have equivalent performance i.e., around 98% which are suitable for the above recommendation system. Hence, the objective to encourage investors and fans to become active stakeholders and owners of the creator’s micro-economy is addressed in this paper.},

We also define four dimensions to comprehensively evaluate the performance of DAO voting mechanisms, which identify the demands and characteristics of DAO voting and put forward clear design guidelines for voting mechanisms in DAOs. Finally, we take seven typical voting mechanisms as examples and analyze their performance in our proposed evaluation schemes.},

 abstract = {The governance technology of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provides an effective solution for solving existing organizational management issues. Governance mechanisms of DAOs are usually encoded in smart contracts in the form of rule sets and executed automatically. However, the mechanism’s logical flaws and code errors expose DAOs to unpredictable risks. Complex adaptive dynamics computer-aided design (CadCAD) can test the effectiveness of the mechanisms through simulation. Nonetheless, as DAOs are typical complex systems with social and engineering complexity, managing, controlling, and supervising their operation through traditional methods are difficult. The parallel intelligence theory based on artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method provides an effective research framework and practical method for solving DAOs’ governance issues. Therefore, in this article, we propose a parallel mechanism verification method and execution system, namely, complex adaptive systems for computer-aided dynamic design (casCAD2) as an extension of cadCAD. Leveraging parallel intelligence and cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS), casCAD2 is capable of probing into the laws that govern system evolution within a simulated environment. It serves as a robust tool for verifying the efficacy of DAOs’ mechanisms and predicting their potential risks. We also build a parallel market-based anchoring mechanism (MAM) system to demonstrate how it can be used for DAOs’ mechanism verification. This study can provide a new research method and application system for DAOs’ effective governance.},

Core assumptions on these differences from academic and grey literature are integrated into a model of the governance layers of the innovative socio-technical arrangement that is a DAO. We test this model against the case of “The DAO”, an early experiment in decentralized autonomous organization, which was forced to be stopped after a hacker stole around 50 Million USD in ETH tokens in 2016. The case history and its effects on actors in and outside “The DAO” highlight important aspects to be considered in judging the efficiency of governance structures of DAOs and related transaction costs. Results indicate that especially in situations of crisis, transaction costs rise again and that people are not as far at the margins of the corporate governance as the concept of a DAO proposes.},

 abstract = {The advent of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous innovations in online governance, with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) emerging as a prominent development, often referred to as “digital jurisdictions.” Despite experiencing remarkable growth, currently boasting nearly 7M users and   ${\$}$  18 billion in assets, DAOs remain relatively underexplored in the existing literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

 abstract = {Blockchain has facilitated the emergence of automation and decentralization concepts, leading to significant organizational and operational changes in businesses, e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In DAOs, management decisions are made collectively and automatically through smart contracts without a central authority, which results in increased cybersecurity requirements. While blockchain integration aims to eliminate single points of failure and enhance data integrity, DAOs remain susceptible to vulnerabilities in consensus mechanisms, key management, and software management, highlighting the need for intrusion detection. Collaborative intrusion detection has been identified as a potential solution to address emerging cyberattacks in a decentralized environment; however, it is not yet fully developed. This study proposes a federated adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (FANFIS) for collaborative intrusion detection in blockchain–Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. The FANFIS maintains a global intrusion detection model in a privacy-preserving manner over the network. Through computational experiments with datasets of KDDCUP99 and Bot-IoT, we found that using the FANFIS reduced the computational time for model training by an average of 49.42% while maintaining a high-performance level. The superior performance of the FANFIS, as demonstrated by its accuracy, precision, and F1-score, surpasses the conventional method involving data centralization, exhibiting mean percentage errors of 1.4092%, 2.6935%, and 1.3463%, respectively.},

The proposed DAO is entirely on-chain, where members can join to pool their funds transparently and securely. The structure of this decentralized platform will be distributed, allowing its members to propose and vote on investment decisions. The DAO's predefined investment strategy will focus on NFTs with a proven track record of successful growth or high potential for future. Additionally, before making any investments, extensive research investigations will be performed. Another potential feature of the proposed DAO platform is the ability to promote stakeholder participation through pre-defined NFTs, assuring active participation from members of the platform. The proposed DAO has the potential to transform NFT investing by promoting a more democratic and inclusive approach. Small investors who would otherwise be unable to participate in the NFT market might do so through this platform by pooling the financial resources. This proposed system incorporates blockchain technology to increase transparency and security, reduce the risk of fraudulent behavior or bad decision-making.

However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.},

 abstract = {Without a doubt the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has been gaining attention over the last years. With the deployment of low cost sensors, a plethora of information is made available, giving rise to intelligent systems that combine data from multiple sources. Multiple IoT platforms have been developed to support different application domains such as smart cities, health, industry 4.0, etc. However, the vertical focus and usually isolated development of such platforms pose difficulties in offering cross-domain smart applications to meet society's needs. To this end, interoperability frameworks have emerged to allow the interplay of different platforms as well as the formation of federations among the entities contributing IoT devices through such platforms. The decentralized nature of IoT data federations presents challenges when it comes to their management and governance, particularly in ensuring fairness, security, trustworthiness and transparency among its members. However, permissioned blockchain-based solutions hold significant potential in addressing these issues due to their inherent characteristics. In this work, we propose a blockchain solution based on the Hyperledger Fabric for the decentralized management of IoT federations and their gover-nance by utilizing voting-based configurable rules that abide to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The solution includes smart contracts for the secure creation and management of federations exposed through APIs, as well as a voting application for enabling the DAO dynamic. Our solution demonstrates a secure, trustworthy and transparent way for the formation and membership control of IoT federations, that holds potential for extension with smart contracts related to data marketplace, as well as reputation and tokenization mechanisms.},

Utilizing a case study, it explores the implementation of a university DAO on the Web3 platform, which leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a user interface to facilitate transparent, secure, and efficient democratic governance. The proposed system empowers students, faculty, and staff to engage in decision-making processes, fostering a more inclusive university community. Despite its potential, the system faces limitations such as reliance on an isolated development environment, legal concerns, and scalability challenges. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges in adopting blockchain-based DAO technology in higher education. It provides insights into its impact on university culture, stakeholder satisfaction, and overall educational quality.},

 abstract = {The rapid advancement of intelligence and connectivity technology (ICT) has enhanced the efficiency and safety of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, this also increases the complexity of the transportation systems, especially the social complexity, and poses new challenges for their management. This paper discusses the emergence of social transportation, as part of natural evolutionary adaptation to new traffic conditions and technology, which is a paradigm shift from engineering-centered technical systems to society-centered ecosystems. In social transportation systems, all participants including administrators, individual travelers and other stakeholders play a more proactive role in the operation and management of transportation systems. Therefore, we propose to employ a decen-tralized autonomous organization (DAO) as a model for the social transportation system that allows participants to collaborate and coordinate without relying on a central authority. To meet the challenges brought by this transition, we propose to apply ACP-based parallel system theory to restructure the methodology of transportation management. Finally, we present a case study of personal carbon trading system where economic incentives are used to manage traffic demand, affecting others' travel behaviors, and reduce carbon emissions. In the conclusive remarks, we provide our visions and future directions of social transportation systems.},

The parallel architecture on M2OS is proposed, including the parallel interactive actual M2OS and artificial M2OS. Among them, the artificial M2OSs provide digital infrastructures for organizations to operate, collaborate, and make decisions in the virtual space, and conduct computational experiments to evaluate management decisions and predict future states of the actual M2OS. Through parallel execution and closed-loop feedback between the artificial and actual M2OSs, the management and control, experimentation and evaluation, as well as learning and training of the actual M2OS can be realized. Moreover, the functional layers of M2OS, including the infrastructure layer, data layer, scenario layer, modeling layer, decision layer, and application layer, are discussed. These layers work together to support the intelligent, autonomous, collaborative, and adaptive nature of the M2OS, and facilitate data-driven decision-making, optimize business operations, and empower managers with real-time actionable insights. The proposed M2OS paradigm has great potential to transform the management paradigm and opens up new possibilities for intelligent and collaborative decision-making.},

However, most DAOs rely heavily on token-centric value systems as well as allocate decision-making authority and yield-sharing rights according to the held tokens, which often lead to monopolization of power and rights. To address this issue, this paper contributes to propose a truly democratic organization model, named True Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), that does not count upon tokens and is guided by principles of contribution-based and on-demand allocation. We first discuss the design of TAOs, including their infrastructures, power structures, and value systems, and then provide a technical roadmap for implementing TAOs in the DeSci context.

While decentralized autonomous organizations continue to thrive, there is a shortage of academic papers analyzing the associated risks. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively examine the current vulnerabilities in these organizations by systematically analyzing past attack incidents. 54 real-world events spanning from 2016 to July 2023 have been collected for identifying and summarizing major attack vectors. The results showcase that flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation, governance takeovers, and reentrancy issues are the critical vulnerabilities within this field. For further protection, this research also provides both general and specific countermeasures against each vulnerability, serving as an evaluation framework for both existing and future projects.},

 abstract = {Given n participants, leader election (LE) is the process of designating one of them as the leader or coordinator. LE is ubiquitous in distributed computing and blockchain and has a wide variety of applications ranging from lotteries to proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a blockchain setting, we normally require our LE protocol to be decentralized, lead to a consensus about the elected leader, and be fair, i.e. elect each participant with the same probability $1 /n.$ Traditional blockchain LE solutions reduce the problem to decentralized uniform sampling from the set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}.$ This reduction leads to approaches which are either vulnerable to manipulation, or fail to guarantee fairness, or require inefficient procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), thus making them gas-inefficient and costly when implemented as smart contracts.In this work, we observe that fair leader election can be achieved without explicit decentralized random number generation (RNG). In other words, the intuition behind our work is that RNG is a strictly harder problem than LE. This is because every LE participant is assumed to prefer to be chosen as the leader, e.g. the participant prefers to win the lottery or be the miner for the next PoS block. Thus, they will refrain from actions that would reduce their chance of being selected. This game-theoretic incentive can be exploited to design much simpler protocols for LE in comparison to RNG, by ensuring that dishonest behavior can only reduce the winning chances of the participant.Specifically, we propose PureLottery, a protocol inspired by single-elimination knockout tournaments in sports such as football. We show that PureLottery selects the winner uniformly at random and provides strong game-theoretic guarantees to incentivize honest behavior. PureLottery is also strongly bias-resistant in the sense that every honest participant is guaranteed to win the lottery with probability at least $1 /n$, even if an adversary controls all of the other $n -1$ players. In other words, dishonest behavior will never increase an adversary’s chances of being elected, even if the adversary controls all but one of the participants. Finally, PureLottery is a simple protocol that can be efficiently implemented as a smart contract and uses a small amount of gas in practice. We provide an open-source implementation of the protocol, dedicated to the public domain with no copyright.},

 abstract = {With a growing complexity of the intelligent traffic system (ITS), an integrated control of ITS that is capable of considering plentiful heterogeneous intelligent agents is desired. However, existing control methods based on the centralized or the decentralized scheme have not presented their competencies in considering the optimality and the scalability simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose an integrated control method based on the framework of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The proposed method achieves a global consensus on energy consumption efficiency (ECE), meanwhile to optimize the local objectives of all involved intelligent agents, through a consensus and incentive mechanism. Furthermore, an operation algorithm is proposed regarding the issue of structural rigidity in DAO. Specifically, the proposed operation approach identifies critical agents to execute the smart contract in DAO, which ultimately extends the capability of DAO-based control. In addition, a numerical experiment is designed to examine the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results indicate that the controlled agents can achieve a consensus faster on the global objective with improved local objectives by the proposed method, compare to existing decentralized control methods. In general, the proposed method shows a great potential in developing an integrated control system in the ITS.},

 abstract = {The attention is a scarce resource in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), as their self-governance relies heavily on the attention-intensive decision-making process of “proposal and voting”. To prevent the negative effects of proposers' attention-capturing strategies that contribute to the “tragedy of the commons” and ensure an efficient distribution of attention among multiple proposals, it is necessary to establish a market-driven allocation scheme for DAOs' attention. First, the Harberger tax-based attention markets are designed to facilitate its allocation via continuous and automated trading, where the individualized Harberger tax rate (HTR) determined by the proposers' reputation is adopted. Then, the Stackelberg game model is formulated in these markets, casting attention to owners in the role of leaders and other competitive proposers as followers. Its equilibrium trading strategies are also discussed to unravel the intricate dynamics of attention pricing. Moreover, utilizing the single-round Stackelberg game as an illustrative example, the existence of Nash equilibrium trading strategies is demonstrated. Finally, the impact of individualized HTR on trading strategies is investigated, and results suggest that it has a negative correlation with leaders' self-accessed prices and ownership duration, but its effect on their revenues varies under different conditions. This study is expected to provide valuable insights into leveraging attention resources to improve DAOs' governance and decision-making process.},

Furthermore, relying on individuals to monitor and control some of the working flows makes the system error-prone and leaves room for corruption. To address these challenges, we propose to use the blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to improve the e-government system. The blockchain-based DAO system works in a fully decentralized way and is immune to both outside and inside attacks. At the same time, operations of such system is only controlled by pre-defined rules; thus, the uncertainty and errors caused by human processes are greatly reduced.

It first came up with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, where it is used to maintain a distributed ledger, a public list of all transactions. It is assumed that the use of a blockchain as a cryptocurrency, or in general for financial services, was just the first stage, called Phase 1.0. The second phase began with the integration of smart contracts. In Phase 3.0, the focus lies on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which efficiently implement smart contracts. In the future, it is assumed, that by the use of DAOs many benefits for the public sector emerge. In this paper, blockchain applications of Phase 2.0 and 3.0 are analyzed for measuring instruments under legal control. An example are smart meters, where by smart contracts, a new coin/token within the blockchain can be created whenever the electric meter rotates. Promising areas of application in legal metrology, like a decentralized audit trail to log, e.g., software updates and hinder uncertified manipulations, the complete automation of the legally supervised update mechanism by smart contracts, or an alternative to public key infrastructures are being proposed in this paper.},

As adoption of blockchain has increased, the need to evolve and adopt new features has grown. These changes highlight the mechanism by which the network, rather than a central node, makes decisions. One change in particular, proposed increases to the block size to address scalability limitations, has been particularly demonstrative of the governance mechanisms employed by disparate blockchains. For example, two digital currency projects, Bitcoin and Dash, employ significantly different governance mechanisms: the Dash Decentralized Governance By Blockchain (DGBB) process, and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, to decide what changes to make to their blockchains. Dash governance was able to decide to alter the block size in a matter of hours, while Bitcoin governance took several years to make the same decision. This paper evaluates the governance mechanisms of blockchain projects using the change in block size as an exemplar. Two prominent governance mechanisms are described, compared, and assessed based upon how effective they came to consensus and made the decision to change to support the disparate needs of stakeholders.},

 abstract = {The use of blockchains is growing every day, and their utility has greatly expanded from sending and receiving crypto-coins to smart-contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations. Modern blockchains underpin a variety of applications: from designing a global identity to improving satellite connectivity. In our research we look at the ability of blockchains to store metadata in an increasing volume of transactions and with evolving focus of utilization. We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse.},

This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency. In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases - Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo’s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be “The DAO Attack” in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary’s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

Nevertheless, there is a clear missing capability of cross-industry and cross-blockchain interoperability. Currently, most blockchain business networks operate in isolation without external data transfer or multi-blockchain interactions. For blockchain technology to ultimately deliver on its promise, blockchain networks must be able to scale from networks addressing individual business processes to very large scale networks of interconnected decentralized autonomous organizations addressing much larger business problems at the level of entire industries and across industries. In this paper, we envision the inception of Internet of Blockchains (IoB), where homogeneous and heterogeneous decentralized networks communicate to facilitate cross-chain transactions of value, data and state transition. In addition, we also discuss interledger techniques that are essential for enabling industry-scale blockchain networks as well as achieving scalable interconnectivity between disparate, distributed ledgers.},

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends.

Creating automated organizations is only but a first step towards the goal. We decided to make an art organization which sells art to make money. The standard way of doing that would be to create a web platform like Amazon (controlled by humans) that sells art and let human artists upload their artwork. But in the interest of keeping this as automated as possible; we have decided to make a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which generates art. Our organization will sell this art created by the GAN and use the revenues to pay for its resources. An AI will be heading it.

 abstract = {Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.},

The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues.

In the second part, while utilizing and building upon the state-of-the-art techniques, we have built a framework for a blockchain-based smart contract and transaction management system. It is a unified architecture supporting DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and organizational level blockchain-based smart contract execution. There are two types of separate blockchains utilized in the proposed framework, i.e., SBlockchain and TBlockchain. SBlockchain is used to store smart contracts, whereas all the data generated by the smart contracts is stored inside the TBlockchain. In addition, each smart contract has some terms and clauses necessary for some event execution. Various components of the framework and their implementation have been described in detail with the help of relevant use-cases.},

Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, data has become more and more important. Most governments have passed laws to control how they are owned and used, such as the GDPR in Europe. However, any law is never perfect. We can see it when a company scattered around the world is hampered by the fact of not being able to exploit customer data outside the borders of a territory. Also, we can add that a data owner is not anymore once he sells them to a third party to be exploited. In this work, we propose a solution based on a permissioned blockchain, namely the Hyperledger Fabric, to allow any stakeholder with data to take part, with value providers, in creating Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAOs). Once created, a DAO can attract other investors to expand it. The Hyperledger Fabric handles this whole process through channels. The infrastructure needed to run the business of the DAO is generated automatically through special transactions taking place at the blockchain level. In the opposite direction, the cloud infrastructure sends notifications to the Hyperledger for traceability and monitoring purposes. Finally, through simulations of wealth distribution models, we show that to keep control of a DAO based on the proposed architecture, the shares must be negotiated according to a Pareto law.},

While a lot of existing analysis (mainly) of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks is available, the lack of measurements for other crypto projects is observed. This article addresses questions about tokenomics and wealth distributions in cryptocurrencies. We analyze the time-dependent statistical properties of top cryptocurrency holders for 14 different distributed ledger projects. The provided metrics include approximated Zipf coefficient, Shannon entropy, Gini coefficient, and Nakamoto coefficient. We show that there are quantitative differences between the coins (cryptocurrencies operating on their own independent network) and tokens (which operate on top of a smart contract platform). Presented results show that coins and tokens have different values of approximated Zipf coefficient and centralization levels. This work is relevant for DLTs as it might be useful in modeling and improving the committee selection process, especially in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchains.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the current management status of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and propose a protocol for managing a DAO. For the management of this form of organization, decentralization and autonomy are particularly critical. This basic premise avoids the potential abuse of power by centralized authority because such a firm is governed by code. In centralized firms, company members have a stronger right to participate in decisions made by high-ranking administrators. Blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized form of indestructible data storage, has gained much attention in recent years. Smart contracts, executable code stored in a blockchain, are based on this concept. We propose an approach to building DAO using smart contracts based on blockchain technology, which provides the optimum conditions for the decentralization and autonomy of DAO. The results show that our proposal outperforms existing solutions in terms of team autonomy within the DAO, the ability of all company members to vote on proposals, and the members elected by the rest of the company for higher positions within the organization. The key benefit of our solution is the universal concept of DAO as a service for any firm with a team-based management approach. This platform may be used by many businesses and also provides extensive access rights control based on predefined rules.},

DeSci fundamentally differs from the centralized science (CeSci) and Open Science (OS) movement built in the centralized way with centralized protocols. It changes the basic structure and legacy norms of current scientific systems via reshaping the cooperation mode, value system, and incentive mechanism. As such, it can provide a viable path for solving bottleneck problems in the development of science, such as oligarchy, silos, and so on, and make science more fair, free, responsible, and sensitive. However, DeSci itself still faces many challenges, including scaling, balancing the quality of participants, system suboptimal loops, lack of accountability mechanism, and so on. Taking these into consideration, this article presents a systematic introduction of DeSci, proposes a novel reference model with a six-layer architecture, addresses the potential applications, and also outlines the key research directions in this emerging field.

The technology could potentially lead to a new generation of decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous organizations. Unfortunately, there is simply too much misinformation regarding blockchain. Most notably, blockchain has been used as a buzzword synonymous with data immutability and trust. In fact, this is far from the truth. In this article, we provide a concise description of exactly what blockchain technology is, including its design principle, building blocks, core innovations, and benefits. This is followed by an analysis of data immutability. We show that to create an insurmountable barrier against attacks on data immutability, decentralization and system scale are both necessary. Based on this analysis, we further dissect what benefits private and consortium blockchain could actually offer when decentralization is removed. We show that private and consortium blockchain cannot offer data immutability and trust as many works in the literature have claimed or implied. Instead, the centralized version of blockchain technology provides an elegant solution to achieving fault tolerance and atomic contract execution, which could make private and consortium blockchain useful for enterprises that would like to provide high availability to their customers and for their internal operations.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

 abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have become an indispensable part of digital infrastructure in recent years. The unique organizational characteristics and functional structure empower them to become an effective tool for solving corporate governance issues, including contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, etc. However, DAOs themselves also face a variety of governance issues. On one hand, as a new economic organization model, the existing corporate governance theories and methods are no longer fully applicable to DAOs. On the other hand, unpredictable logic vulnerabilities and code loopholes in the governance mechanism might cause devastating damage to DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the ACP method (i.e., artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution) is an elegant research paradigm and a practical approach tailored to solving these challenges. As such, we propose a novel parallel governance framework for DAOs based on the parallel intelligence theory and further discuss its technical methodology and implementation model. Furthermore, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO and conduct computational experiments to validate the effectiveness of its governance mechanism. The experimental results not only confirm the defects of the GnosisDAO governance mechanism but also illustrate parallel governance as a useful research direction to solve existing governance problems of DAOs.},

This review assesses the potential of blockchain technology to enhance the hydrogen economy, a vital component in advancing global sustainable energy initiatives. Findings from comprehensive literature reviews and specific case studies, including “HydroChain” and “H2-Share,” are synthesized to evaluate blockchain's ability to improve transparency, efficiency, and compliance within hydrogen production, storage, and distribution systems. The results indicate that blockchain technology could significantly enhance hydrogen traceability and certification, facilitate robust peer-to-peer energy trading platforms, and strengthen market dynamics through improved logistical operations. However, notable challenges such as scalability, interoperability among diverse blockchain systems, and the need for adaptive regulatory frameworks are identified as major barriers to its full adoption. Addressing these challenges will require a multidisciplinary approach and proactive collaboration among stakeholders to develop scalable blockchain solutions that can effectively integrate with existing technologies. The successful implementation of blockchain in the hydrogen sector could greatly contribute to achieving net-zero emissions and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, providing a replicable model for other sectors in the energy industry.},

The proposed system is developed as an inference engine while having a number of interesting features. First, the system validates and audits the decision-making process while sharing and recording the input data and the computed outcomes in a synchronized trusted manner. Second, the system allows the formation of distributed AI repository that can absorb and manage concurrent use-cases while targeting different scopes and covering diverse AI branches. Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data. A case study of estimating the construction cost for road projects is provided to illustrate the system’s workability and demonstrate its performance.},

 abstract = {Under pressures to reach net zero emissions by 2050, there is an ongoing transition of energy decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization. Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition.},

 abstract = {In remote communities, hybrid energy systems are increasingly used to improve the reliability and renewability of power supply. The techno-economic analysis is often used to develop these promising energy systems, ignoring some performance indicators and environmental factors. This study proposes a multi-approach framework for developing operationally feasible, economically viable, and environmentally sustainable hybrid energy systems in remote areas. A case study is conducted on Con Dao Island in Vietnam to supply its electricity demand using six on-grid and off-grid hybrid energy systems. After finding the best techno-economic configurations of the six developed systems, they are subjected to multi-approach analysis and exhaustive comparison using a set of performance, economic, and environmental indicators. An off-grid hybrid energy system comprising photovoltaics, wind turbines, lead-acid batteries, and diesel generators has the lowest net present cost (109.7 million USD) to supply the predicted island's electricity consumption (with a total on-site electricity generation of 184.1 GWh/yr). However, this off-grid system indicates the highest excess energy fraction (55%), while the on-grid systems with the ability to export excess energy to the grid have no excess energy fraction. In terms of eco-friendliness, an on-grid hybrid energy system consisting of a high level of photovoltaics and wind turbines shows the best results, with a negative total environmental impact and CO2-eq emissions. This on-grid system shows the best cost of energy (0.1 USD/kWh) with approximately 450% less total environmental impact than the best off-grid system investigated, offsetting about 48.2 kilotonnes of CO2-eq/yr by exporting net emission-free electricity. Overall, the proposed framework can assist decision-makers in finding feasible, viable, and sustainable hybrid energy systems.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has gained considerable attention for different types of stakeholders due to its stable implementation in the field of digital currency like Bitcoin. Some users use Bitcoin for payment exchanges against any business while others use the Bitcoin network for earning Bitcoins itself, and there is also another type of user who called hackers those flood different types of attacks to illegally earn some Bitcoins or collapsing overall network. There are also numerous uses of blockchain technology, e.g. health, automation industry, energy sector, security and authentication in smart grids. In this study, we have elaborated on different critical aspects of Blockchain technology like its style of working mechanism, possible improvement suggestions by using Proof-of-Stake, and other custom variations, attempting seven types of challenges by different novel techniques. Moreover, we have also explained the current state-of-the-artwork in blockchain’s non-financial applications like Healthcare in which contribution of four-layered custom blockchain models related to precision medicine and the clinical trial was notable. Moreover, a mobile app model called HDG for the automation of medical records without compromising privacy was also a prominent contribution.},

 abstract = {Although the governance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) has attracted the interest of several academics, few studies have empirically examined how DAOs are governed. We use an exploratory, inductive approach to comprehensively examine how DAOs are currently governed and the ramifications of this. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 DAO members from a variety of sectors to identify how they arrange their voting processes, distribute collaborative decision-making, and maintain their tokens. Three themes emerge from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) voting structure, (2) proposal management, and (3) token management. Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose. However, the operations and methods implemented are more oriented toward agency viewpoints due to their reliance on incentive-based processing and are based on a lack of trust among DAO stakeholders. This study provides empirical insights into DAO governance mechanisms.11Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).},

In this paper we apply the lens of user innovation toolkit theory to the development of Web3. Toolkits are an organizational design solution to an innovation problem with sticky and local information. Our aim is to explore how toolkits theory applies to Web3 innovation, proposing that Web3 innovation is being organized through toolkits (e.g., blockchains, token standards, DAO frameworks) that enable efficient organization of sticky information to facilitate innovation. The contribution of this paper is the first application of toolkits theory to Web3, reframing its development as a problem of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of distributed information. We provide implications for the role of developers as user innovators, the economic problem of emergent toolkit stacking, and the design of toolkit business models.},

Using smart contracts, business logic can be automated and assets such as money become programmable, which opens up previously inaccessible application potential. To date, smart contracts control billions in value. This paper analyzes 468 articles on the topic of smart contracts and their 20,188 references, providing a summary and analysis of the current state of research on smart contracts and identifying intellectual structures and emerging trends. Using exploratory factor analysis for co-citation analysis, six different strands of research are identified that concern technical, social, economic and legal disciplines: I) technical foundations, development and open questions of blockchain networks, II) blockchain and smart contracts for the Internet of Things, III) smart contract standardization, verification and security, IV) blockchain and smart contracts for the disruption of existing processes and industries, V) potentials and challenges of smart contracts, and VI) smart contracts and the law. The interrelations between these groups and individual high-impact publications are visualized using social network analysis. A structured overview of the main strands of research concerning smart contracts, their development over time, the relevance of smart contract platforms in research, and conceptual connections between publications and discourses is obtained. Based on the results, starting points for future research are derived, which offer researchers and practitioners a substantial basis for their work on smart contracts.},

Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts and analysed through the lens of the Interactive Communication Technology Adoption Model (ICTAM) as a guiding framework. The findings reveal that all factors of the ICTAM (system, audience, social, technology, adoption, and use) influence blockchain adoption simultaneously and often in contradictory ways. This study has several contributions. It is among the first to investigate blockchain adoption in online advertising, and from a communication perspective. It extends the application of the ICTAM to a whole ecosystem perspective and identifies which factors are essential for successful blockchain adoption in online advertising. The study concludes that while blockchain technology is a promising solution to challenges afflicting online advertising, more education about blockchain’s potential, favourable regulation, and ready-to-use applications are needed before wide-scale adoption can be realised.},

 abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.},

We follow a mixed-method approach based on web mining and topic modeling with unstructured empirical data on blockchain innovators from Crunchbase, their websites, and academic publications to address these research questions. Our results indicate that blockchain innovators already engage in various application areas beyond the financial sector, addressing critical development issues. However, the empirical data on blockchain research and innovations suggests a largely untapped potential in various promising application areas relevant for the SDGs, such as sustainable energy or integrity verification. The major contributions of this paper are an overview and status quo of entrepreneurial innovation activities and research on blockchain technology in the GS, an analysis of these areas in the context of the SDGs, and a lean methodological approach for innovation forecasting.},

We investigate business ventures leveraging blockchain technology to manage the intellectual property life cycle, in other words how intellectual properties are created, protected, managed and monetized. Our research method is a multiple case study examining a total of 120 use cases. across all primary types of intellectual properties including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, industrial design and geographical indications. The empirical validation is based on an in-depth within-case analysis of 26 applications which were selected from the initial 120 cases based on business maturity and popularity criteria. Our goal is to understand which intellectual property challenges distributed ledger technology is trying to solve and how. We also investigate which blockchain benefits, in terms of technological security, immutability, decentralization, tokenization or disintermediation are promoted by these applications. We triangulate our case study results using a PESTEL coding framework to better understand how the blockchain ecosystem manages the intellectual property life cycle and to provide scholarly researchers and practitioners with insights on how enterprises can use distributed ledger technology to enhance the management of the intellectual property value chain. Moreover, we validate theoretical findings through the evidence collected from our multiple case study analysis, and finally we provide strategic guidance in investigating the current and anticipated challenges of blockchain entrepreneurs to drive further distributed ledger innovation.},

 abstract = {The rise of prosumers – individuals who both produce and consume energy – presents a significant opportunity to reshape energy markets and achieve carbon neutrality. However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platform’s potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a new form of organization, the innovation of which consists in the use of blockchain technology to record the applicable rules governing the project as well as the rights and obligations of its members, usually investors. Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.},

There is a lack of evidence regarding herding in blockchain technology in general and its potential effect on blockchain application platforms in particular. In response to this new technological phenomenon, we studied whether and how herding behaviors take place in the context of blockchain applications for operations in this research. We propose two new variables related to the operation of the blockchain application (i.e., technical assurance and decentralized management efforts) and a new variable related to user identity (i.e., identifiability). We found evidence of the existence of herding by utilizing the objective data of approximately 0.1 million transactions on a leading blockchain application platform providing self-service and collateral-based lending services. Our empirical findings also reveal that technical assurance and decentralized management efforts reduce users' herding tendencies. Moreover, we found that the higher the identifiability, the lower the users' herding tendency, and the less they are affected by technical assurance and decentralized management efforts.},

This study engages with eleven distinguished blockchain experts to critically analyze the prospects of technology integration across various facets of the circular economy, aiming to predict potential outcomes. Utilizing the Delphi method, this research seeks to attain a consensus on the experts' visions and opinions. The findings suggest a nuanced perspective: while certain integrations in the circular economy may face challenges and are unlikely to succeed, others could prove effective in the long term, provided specific conditions are met. When appropriately designed Tokenomics are in place, and the necessary level of digitalization is achieved, blockchain technology can significantly incentivize circular economy practices.

 abstract = {Blockchain has become one of the great drivers of technological evolution of nowadays, making industries interested in the possible applications of that technology. One of the sectors that can benefit from this technology is the online betting industry. According to Statista, the total value of transactions carried out in this industry will be 92.9 billion dollars in 2023. Therefore, the need to make transactions more transparent is undoubtedly one of the main requirements of the betting industry, which promotes continuous technological development in the search for ideal solutions. This “technology” allows the creation of records that cannot be falsified. The applicability of this technology in the betting industry can be very attractive in terms of ensuring greater transparency in transactions. Furthermore, in order to decentralize the organization, it is also intended to implement a DAO governance model. This model aims to solve a centralized governance problem and, therefore, consists of governance based on the code and not on a single person/entity. In the scope of this paper, it was possible to demonstrate through a proof-of-concept solution, the applicability of Blockchain and the DAO governance model in a bookmaker. Thie solution was designed and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, using smart contracts. The results obtained in the comparison study showed that the solution is viable and presents advantages compared to traditional solutions.},

 abstract = {Recently, blockchain has attracted attention as one of the most promising key platform technologies for leveraging IoT (Internet of Things) security and auditing management with trusted and decentralized architecture. Therefore, the possibilities of using blockchain for providing scalable management, efficient access, and accountability for the massive numbers of extant and emerging IoT devices merits investigation. In this study, we implement a blockchain-enabled IoT auditing management system complying with ISO/IEC 15408-2 requirements. The implemented system is operated with a stable data retrieval time, i.e. 25.74 to 26.77 microseconds, and a stable compressing and uploading time, i.e. 32.51 and 39.9 microseconds when handling and accessing below 100 logs. With more logs, the processing time raises in a proportional manner. The introduced auditing system represents an evolutionary paradigm not only possessing the advantageous characteristics of blockchain technology, i.e. de-centralization, robustness and tamper-resistance, but also fulfilling the critical requirements from ISO/IEC 15408-2 with respect to auditing perspective. Moreover, the scalability is guaranteed, as our proposed IoT auditing management system is suitable for versatile IoT-oriented application services (even on heterogeneous platforms).},

This article describes the impact and revolution of FinTech and Blockchain in the financial industry and demonstrates the main characteristics of such technology. Then, we present three critical challenges as well as three ethical issues about using Blockchain technology. Next, we discuss the development of Blockchain for the financial sector. In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed. Finally, this article suggests how financial services should respond to this new technology and how to manage knowledge sharing in a more structured way. This article contributes to the literature related to the current entrepreneurial finance landscape for Blockchain.},

 abstract = {In the information age, electronic documents (e-documents) have become a popular alternative to paper documents due to their lower costs, higher dissemination rates, and ease of knowledge sharing. However, digital copyright infringements occur frequently due to the ease of copying, which not only infringes on the rights of creators but also weakens their creative enthusiasm. Therefore, it is crucial to establish an e-document sharing system that enforces copyright protection. However, the existing centralized system has outstanding vulnerabilities, and the plagiarism detection algorithm used cannot fully detect the context, semantics, style, and other factors of the text. Digital watermark technology is only used as a means of infringement tracing. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for e-document sharing based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and non-fungible token (NFT) in blockchain. The use of blockchain as a distributed credit base resolves the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional centralized systems. The e-document evaluation and plagiarism detection mechanisms based on the DAO model effectively address challenges in comprehensive text information checks, thereby promoting the enhancement of e-document quality. The mechanism for protecting and circulating e-document copyrights using NFT technology ensures effective safeguarding of users’ e-document copyrights and facilitates e-document sharing. Moreover, recognizing the security issues within the DAO governance mechanism, we introduce an innovative optimization solution. Through experimentation, we validate the enhanced security of the optimized governance mechanism, reducing manipulation risks by up to 51%. Additionally, by utilizing evolutionary game analysis to deduce the equilibrium strategies of the framework, we discovered that adjusting the reward and penalty parameters of the incentive mechanism motivates creators to generate superior quality and unique e-documents, while evaluators are more likely to engage in assessments.},

For supporting this hypothesis, striking analogies between the concepts underlying blockchain technology with research are identified, and applied to the generation of verified knowledge in science and technology development. It is then elaborated how a blockchain-enabled token economy can efficiently and transparently incentivize and coordinate an integrative and community-inclusive participatory approach to fuel crowdsourcing of collective intelligence for contributing ideas, work, infrastructure, funding, data, validation, management, assessment, governance, arbitration and exploitation of projects. Quality, credibility and direction of projects are optimized by demanding collateral “skin-in-the-game” from contributors based on blockchain-enabled staking, reputation systems and prediction markets. This way research progress emerges as a chain of community generated and independently vetted blocks of scientific knowledge; these new blocks are concatenated with the state-of-the-art according to transparent consensus mechanisms.},

The integration of blockchain technology into the education system has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency, security, and credibility of the educational process. By creating secure and transparent platforms for tracking and verifying students' academic achievements, blockchain technology can help to create a more accessible and trustworthy education system, making it easier for students to showcase their skills and knowledge to potential employers. While the potential benefits of blockchain in education are significant, there are also several challenges that must be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of this technology in the educational sector. Some of the major challenges include adoption, technical knowledge, interoperability, regulation, cost, data privacy and security, scalability, and accessibility. The necessary equipment for the implementation of blockchain technology in education is diverse and critical to the success of this innovative technology. Organizations should carefully consider this equipment when planning their implementation of blockchain technology in education to ensure the efficient and secure transfer of educational data and transactions within the blockchain network. Blockchain technology has the potential to play a significant role in promoting sustainability education and advancing the sustainability goals of both individuals and organizations. Organizations should consider incorporating blockchain technology into their sustainability education programs, in order to enhance the transparency, verifiability, and efficiency of their sustainability-related activities.

Thus, in contrast to earlier iterations of the web, Web3 users are asked to trust the technology itself rather than the human intermediaries. On its face, this shift to a trustless web calls into question the traditional conceptions of and requirements for trust. However, in this article, we caution against claims that advocate distrusting Web3 on the basis that, despite how quickly Web3 technology is advancing, the psychological processes through which people perceive and make sense of the social world remain fundamentally unchanged. Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research.

 abstract = {C.H. Waddington's concepts of ‘chreods’ (canalized paths of development) and ‘homeorhesis’ (the tendency to return to a path), each associated with ‘morphogenetic fields’, were conceived by him as a contribution to complexity theory. Subsequent developments in complexity theory have largely ignored Waddington's work and efforts to advance it. Waddington explained the development of the concept of chreod as the influence on his work of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, notably, the concept of concrescence as a self-causing process. Processes were recognized as having their own dynamics, rather than being explicable through their components or external agents. Whitehead recognized the tendency to think only in terms of such ‘substances’ as a bias of European thought, claiming in his own philosophy ‘to approximate more to some strains of Indian, or Chinese, thought, than to western Asiatic, or European, thought.’ Significantly, the theoretical biologist who comes closest to advancing Waddington's research program, also marginalized, is Mae-Wan Ho. Noting this bias, and embracing Whitehead's and Waddington's efforts to free biology from assumptions dominating Western thought to advance an ontology of creative causal processes, I will show how later developments of complexity theory, most importantly, Goodwin's work on oscillations, temporality and morphology, Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics, Salthe's work on hierarchy theory, biosemiotics inspired by Peirce and von Uexküll, Robert Rosen's work on anticipatory systems, together with category theory and biomathics, can augment while being augmented by Waddington's work, while further advancing Mae-Wan Ho's radical research program with its quest to understand the reality of consciousness.},

 abstract = {Firms are increasingly adopting blockchains as a form of knowledge engineering to align their internal processes, share information, and improve oversight. We study intraorganizational blockchains from an agency perspective to understand how the distributed, sequenced, and consensus-based nature of blockchains mitigates information asymmetries and affects organizational structures. First, we explain how blockchains differ from conventional relational, contractual, and system-based mechanisms to address three pertinent information challenges—concentration, continuity, and conflict. Subsequently, we address the consequences of introducing such blockchains, arguing that they create both direct and sequenced information channels among principals and agents, which elicit an organizational reconfiguration via vertical disintermediation and lateral reintermediation. Finally, we theorize the implications of blockchain-based organizing for agency theory regarding the chain of command, the unity of direction, and the span of control. Overall, we show how blockchains for intraorganizational governance can mitigate principal-agent problems and impact organizational design in profound ways.},

 abstract = {While the sharing economy has promised to solve a range of problems associated with traditional consumption, the reality is more akin to its inability or even exacerbation of economic and societal issues. We propose that blockchain technology could address these issues. To this end, we explain its potential by elaborating on how blockchain-based sharing services can help solve exploitation, data abuse, financial and legal risks, and the limited accessibility of current sharing practices. Moreover, we conduct a means–end chain analysis to provide a customer’s perspective on the motivations and fears related to blockchain-based sharing solutions. We find four motives (trust, self-determination, quality of life, and security) and two fears (mistrust and economic interest) related to blockchain-based sharing. By juxtaposing the potential benefits of blockchain-based shared services with customer insights, we provide an outline of research avenues for promoting blockchain-based sharing to overcome the current dark side of sharing practices.},

Blockchain began its journey from the concept of cryptocurrency and is now part of a range of core applications to achieve resilience and automation between various tasks. However, with the integration of Blockchain technology into different industrial applications, many application designs, security, and privacy challenges present themselves, posing serious threats to users and their data. Although several approaches have been proposed to address the specific application, security and privacy challenges of targeted applications with limited security enhancement solutions, there is still a need for a comprehensive research study on the application design, security and privacy challenges, and requirements of Blockchain-based industrial applications, along with possible security threats and countermeasures. This study presents a comprehensive and state-of-the-art survey of Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 applications, focusing on potential application design, security and privacy requirements, as well as corresponding attacks on Blockchain systems with potential countermeasures. We also analyse and provide the classification of security and privacy techniques used in these applications to enhance the advancement of security features. Furthermore, we highlight some open issues of integrating Blockchain technology into industrial applications that help design secure Blockchain-based applications as future directions.},

The progress data is stored in a distributed manner using content addressable file sharing; it is then broadcasted to a smart contract which administers payments and transfers lien rights respectively using crypto currencies/tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFT). The method was successfully implemented for payments to 7 subcontractors in two real-world commercial construction projects in Canada and United States where progress was captured using a camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The method eliminates reliance on today's heavily intermediated payment applications and showed promise for achieving accurate, efficient, and timely payment administration.

 abstract = {The language barrier is the biggest obstacle for users watching foreign-language videos. Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker’s revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.},

 abstract = {The traditional industrial chain consists of a group of entities that are familiar with each other, and the relationship between the entities is maintained by signing contracts. However, on the one hand, the inability to reach mutual trust between unfamiliar entities limits the collaboration of entities, and on the other hand, most of the profits in the industrial chain are grabbed by the dominant enterprises. In this paper, an information system for collaboration among business entities is developed based on blockchain, based on which a business model called Decentralized Industry Alliance (DIA) is proposed. Transactions and profit distribution in the DIA are executed by smart contracts, which enables unfamiliar entities to trust each other without relying on a third party. Any entity that voluntarily complies with the smart contracts automatically becomes a member of the DIA, thereby promoting the expansion of the industry scale. The smart contracts distribute profits according to each entity’s contribution to the alliance, so as to ensure the fairness of value distribution. A case about the alliance of elderly care industry is carried out, which shows that the DIA achieves rapid expansion on the premise of ensuring fairness. As a general business model in the web 3.0 era, the DIA can be referenced by other industries.},

 abstract = {The effective prediction of corrosion inhibition efficiency (%IE) of modified graphene oxides (GOs); diaminohexane-modified graphene oxide (DAH-GO) and diaminooctane-modified graphene oxide (DAO-GO) is vital for advanced material applications. This study employs a dual-modelling scheme to predict the %IE, for this purpose, four stand-alone machine learning (ML) models (Multivariate Regression (MVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Neural Network (NN)), and five simple averaging (SA) ensemble paradigms (MVR-SA, GPR-SA, ANFIS-SA, NN-SA, and Decision Tree-SA (DT-SA)). Feature selection processes were carried out to develop three distinct models, leading to a comprehensive comparative analysis. The results demonstrated that the non-linear stand-alone models (GPR, ANFIS, NN) significantly outperform the linear MVR model, with the M2 model configuration yielding the highest performance across all models. Remarkably, GPR-M2 achieved perfect model tuning with zero error rates, indicating its superior predictive capabilities. Ensemble techniques further improved performance, reflecting the experimental data's complexities in %IE modelling. The hierarchical order of performance in the training phase in the testing phase is DT-SA < MVR-SA < ANFIS-SA < NN-SA < GPR-SA. The GPR-SA ensemble emerged as the most accurate technique, substantially enhancing the predictive accuracy of the ensemble models by up to 67.73% in the training phase and 50.71% in the testing phase. These findings suggest the potential of GPR-SA in boosting the performance of ensemble approaches in material science applications. The study recommended a promising future for ML in the development and application of corrosion-inhibitors.},

 abstract = {Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as a common endocrine disease in reproductive-age women, which is characterized by both reproductive and metabolic disorders. Cang-Fu-Dao-Tan Formula (CFDTF) is an effective and relatively safe treatment for PCOS. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood.
Purpose
To explore the effective compounds and mechanisms of CFDTF in treating PCOS based on UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, network pharmacology and molecular experiments.
Methods
The UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS and TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction databases were used to identify the active ingredients of CFDTF. Then GeneCards, Disgenet, Drugbank databases were used to obtain the PCOS related targets. Based above, the Drug-component-target (D-C-T) network and protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network were built to analysis the key targets. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed to find the potential mechanisms. Finally, molecular docking analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular experiments were used to confirm the interactions among the active compounds, targets and explore the potential mechanisms.
Results
A total of 20 compounds were identified by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, and 136 active compounds by TCMSP from CFDTF. After removing the duplicate results, there were 370 targets related to both CFDTF and PCOS, among which, MAPK3, AKT1, RELA, EGF, TP53 and MYC were proved to have high interactions with the components. The mechanisms of CFDTF against PCOS were related to PI3K-Akt, mTOR, MAPK signaling pathways, and the in vitro experiments proved that the CFDTF positively regulated the cell proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis levels in PCOS cell model.
Conclusions
The combination of UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, systematic network pharmacology and molecular experiments identified that the quercetin, hesperidin, and glycyrrhizin disaccharide are the TOP 3 effective compounds of CFDTF in treating PCOS and the potential mechanisms may involve in regulating proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells.},

We found statistically significant differences in allelic frequencies of rs2052129 (p = .009, OR = 1.462; 95% CI: 1.098–1.947) and rs10156191 (p = .019, OR = 1.430; 95% CI: 1.060–1.928) variants in DAO gene. For rs1015691, we were able to show statistically significant association at all genotypic, dominant and allelic levels in both MA (for T allele, p = .020; OR = 1.662, 95% CI: 1.083–2.551) as well as in female subgroup (for T allele, p = .025, OR = 1.460; 95% CI: 1.049–2.033). But no such significant association was found in clinical sub grouping of migraine in rs2052129 as p > .05. However in gender analysis, protective effect of T allele in male migraine patients for rs2052129 (OR < 1) was found.
Conclusions
Our findings clearly indicated that a female patient with rs10156191T allele and in MA subgroup showed an increased risk for migraine. Our data also indicated that rs2052129T variant showed a significant role in migraine susceptibility of this population.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT
Blockchain has received considerable attention recently, due to its promises of verifiable, permanent, and decentralized data handling. In 2017–2020, blockchain (and associated technologies such as smart contracts) has progressed beyond cryptocurrencies, and has been hailed as a disruptive technology for a score of industries. This study adds to the growing body of research on blockchain adoption and blockchain-driven innovation in various fields, including transport, finance, and education. However, the impact of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) on the management of science has not been systematically studied so far. This paper aims to fill the gap by studying the experience of adoption of blockchain-based solutions in academia in 2017–2020. The research is based upon a critical review of projects, relevant literature, and qualitative research: interviews (N = 24) and focus groups (N = 4) with startup founders, scholars, university executives, librarians, and IT experts from the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), Russia, and Belarus. Key challenges and barriers to blockchain adoption in academia are delineated: usability and security issues, legal concerns, conflict of values, and a critique of political dimensions of blockchain governance.},

 abstract = {This paper evaluates blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy. Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.},

 abstract = {Two-thirds of the earth's surface is surrounded by water and the majority of it is still unexplored. The underwater monitoring of the oceans and their surroundings is highly crucial from several perspectives, e.g., to unearth the hidden minerals/oils, to monitor the life of underwater species, military and rescue applications, surveillance of maritime borders, and predict tidal wave behaviors among others. The exploration and inspection activities of the underwater environment are mainly performed remotely by unmanned underwater vehicles or robots because human direct involvement in such a complex environment might not be a feasible option. Moreover, the recent maturity in digital automation and underwater drone technology along with the emergence and improvements in wireless, communication, and sensing technologies had already encouraged the research community to drive deep into this domain. Among several disruptive enabling technologies, Blockchain has emerged as a vital enabling technology to fulfil key requirements for secure data sharing, storage, process tracking, collaboration, and resource management. This study presents a comprehensive review of the utilization of Blockchain in different underwater applications, discussing various use cases along with detailing blockchain-based architectures, potential challenges, solutions, and future research directions. Potential challenges of underwater applications addressed by Blockchain have been detailed. This work identifies knowledge gaps between theoretical research and real-time Blockchain integration in realistic underwater drone applications. The key limitations for effective integration of Blockchain in real-time integration in Unmanned Underwater Drones (UUD) applications, along with directions for future research have been presented.},

 abstract = {Manufacturers are increasingly aware of the importance of system resilience against unexpected disruptive occurrences, such as the recent global Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical wars in Europe. Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.},

 abstract = {The contribution of distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g. blockchain) and smart contracts to the digitalisation and digital transformation of the construction sector is nascent but rapidly gaining traction. ‘Systematic reviews’ of DLT and smart contract applications that are specific to the construction sector are missing. This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.},

 abstract = {Effective governance plays a pivotal role in aligning the interests of diverse stakeholders and shaping the strategic directions of organizations. However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.},

 abstract = {The rise of blockchain technology has brought innovations in various business domains and spawned a new form of organization—the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Steemit is recognized as one of the earliest blockchain-based online communities, and a typical example of DAO. By endowing community members with new roles, the decentralization of blockchain-based communities brings changes to the design of user incentive mechanisms. However, few studies have paid attention to the user incentive mechanism when users play the dual roles of social participant and community owner. On the basis of social capital theory and psychological ownership theory, this study explores Steemit's incentive mechanism by evaluating the impact of these dual roles on user active participation behavior. The study adopts a two-way fixed effect negative binomial regression to test the research model. The results show that users’ social capital, share capital, social feedback, and economic feedback positively affect their active participation behavior. At the same time, social feedback and economic feedback play moderating roles on the effects of the dual capitals. Overall, this research provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for understanding, designing, and governing blockchain-based online communities.},

Proximity Radio Access Network (P-RAN), which was proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), expands the cellular structure from base station to intelligent terminal equipment through device to device (D2D) technology, which provides a cost-effective deployment solution for the 5G and 6G. The extensive deployment of P-RAN solution should be based on the active participation of a large number of distributed intelligent equipment users. Fair, reasonable and credible incentive solution is the key to realize the sustainable operation of this distributed system. This paper introduces a technical solution that applying blockchain technology to design P-RAN operating and incentive mechanism. Through blockchain technology, the current centralized P-RAN operation and incentive can be achieved in point-to-point way. By utilizing blockchain-based identity authentication and asymmetric key pairs, user and relay can confirm and sign the network usage information in sequence to reduce disputes. The abstract of all transactions related to P-RAN services can be recorded on blockchain immutably as the calculation basis of relay rewards. Through smart contracts and P-RAN incentive policy, relays that provide more and higher quality P-RAN service will be rewarded more, which can help to create positive feedback in this decentralized system. The tokens awarded to relays will be able to exchange through the blockchain network for the increase of the whole ecosystem utility. Blockchain-based P-RAN operation and incentive solution pioneer a way to the future heterogeneous network resource sharing and collaboration for supporting Web3.0 and Metaverse.},

Along with performing field measurement in this intended block, in addition, a three-dimensional microclimatic modelling tool ENVI-met 4.0 is used to evaluate the outdoor thermal comfort and validate the accuracy of the software through comparing the measured data with the simulated data. The existing scenario shows that almost the whole area is not comfortable for visiting from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm in extreme summer. After putting forward some suggestion for redesigning this area, the result shows that there is a strong improvement in broadening the cooling time, which means the more suitable time for visiting is given, the new result shows that early morning (8:00–11:00 am) and after 6:00 pm are the most comfortable time for visiting.},

 abstract = {With the advent of blockchain, smart contracts have become one of the most sought-after technologies because of the high customisability they add to transactions. This has given rise to many smart contract applications in areas ranging from financial services, life sciences and healthcare to energy resources and voting. However, due to their infancy, smart contracts still pose many challenges that encumber the stakeholders who interact with them: users, developers and the organisations that are built on top of smart contracts. This study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge of smart contracts within blockchain technology. Based on a systematic mapping study, we offer a broad perspective on their problems and corresponding solutions, present the research trends within the area and compile the 64 papers identified, grouped by top publication sources, channels, methods and approaches. We conclude that, since 2016, there has been an increasing trend towards the publication of blockchain-based smart contract articles at conferences and journals, mainly reflecting experiments and presenting methods, tools and models. According to the results, the most commonly discussed problems and solutions in the literature are related to the security, privacy and scalability of blockchain and the programmability of smart contracts.},

Smart cities can offer various smart applications such as intelligent transportation, industry 4.0, smart banking, among others, for boosting the life quality of citizens. Security is one of the key challenges of a smart city. One can enable smart cities with a blockchain to offer enhanced security via storing transactions in a secure, transparent, decentralized, and immutable ledger. However, both blockchain and smart cities are in their infancy and significant research efforts are needed to integrate them. In this paper, we comprehensively review the role of blockchain in enabling IoT-based smart cities. First, we present the evolution of blockchain technology in terms of constituent technologies, consensus algorithms, and blockchain platforms. Second, we discuss and critically evaluate various smart applications enabled by blockchain. Third, we present real-world blockchain implementation in smart cities as case studies. Fourth, we present the key requirements to integrate blockchain with smart cities. Finally, we present open research challenges along with their key causes and possible solutions.},

To overcome this, rural areas have experimented with decentralised governance. However, this process is fraught with political, fiscal, and institutional difficulties. These often revolve around transparency and accountability issues and low participation rates. Blockchain technology could act as a social innovation to overcome issues in decentralised governance, and rural areas could even prove to be a fertile environment for future innovation. In this conceptual paper, the potential of blockchain technology is theoretically positioned in regional development discourses. After exploring how blockchain could be applied to rural governance and the barriers it needs to overcome to reach mass adoption, a new distributed model of governance is suggested.},

In this paper, we provide an analysis of blockchain governance through a case study of the first cryptocurrency to adopt on-chain voting, Dash. Our analysis introduces the key characteristics of blockchain governance, steps through a data-driven exploration of Dash's on-chain voting system, and highlights exploitable attack vectors and vulnerabilities for the subversion of Dash's on-chain voting system via a novel network analysis methodology. We then conclude with guidelines for other organizations looking to implement similar blockchain governance solutions while maintaining integrity in their operations.},

Web3 describes a broad range of emerging internet applications for blockchain technology (i.e., a decentralized, public database that allows information to be securely recorded on a network of computers rather than verified and controlled by centralized entities). Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices. We conclude by addressing how established companies can prepare for a more decentralized internet.},

 abstract = {Smart contracts are a vital component of applications being built by blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Smart contracts consists of computer code that composed set of rules agreed upon by the involved parties. When these predefined conditions or rules are satisfied by the transactions initiated by parties, the smart contract executes itself to complete the transaction. Normally, while performing transactions with agreements involving multiple parties, a third party have to be involve to verify all the information, which makes it complex and time consuming process. Smart contracts simplify this process by eliminating the third party and automating the process, enabling the stakeholders to perform transactions directly with each other. Smart contract itself is replicated among multiple nodes of a blockchain there by giving benefits of immutability, security and permanence. Most smart contracts are written in Solidity programming language due to its simplicity and conciseness. Attackers are attracted by the popularity of Solidity language and its vulnerability possibilities. For example, in the 2016 year, 60 million US dollars was theft by Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack due to vulnerabilities present in smart contracts. There are few existing tools and papers on this area to find vulnerabilities on smart contracts but taking more time to predict. Thus, this paper presents different Deep learning techniques with satisfactory results to identify smart contract vulnerabilities which are Re-entrancy, Denial of Service (DOS) and Transaction Origin using binary, multi class and multi label classification techniques.},

@article{NAWARI2019100832,
 abstract = {Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a ‘block’, the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.},

Additionally, the paper presents a framework derived from comparing these two blockchain platforms. Finally, the framework is evaluated, and open questions and challenges are analysed.},

The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel ‘Blockchain Agency Theory’ that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike.},

However, the majority of the previous studies have focused on the technical aspects, and overlooked blockchain investigation from a managerial perspective. In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions—transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement—, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.},

Our findings reveal that both factors significantly influence the efficiency of crypto-assets.

This suggests that transparent decentralized decision-making models can reduce information asymmetry, leading to a more efficient market pricing. Furthermore, we show a positive relationship between market efficiency and increased liquidity and age.

 abstract = {This paper aims to critically examine the scholarly work conducted in blockchain (BC) governance. Without venturing into the wide range of governance paradigms, this research considers governance structures based on trust as a foundation for BC governance. A thematic systematic literature review is conducted to understand the literature on this topic, employing the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis) technique. An examination of 155 papers shows that using BC technology (BCT) replaces the cognitive attribution of trust in the material and human-independent code. It is also found that further research anchored to the ‘trust’ concept is required in building BC governance structures. To provide the direction in which the literature is travelling, future research questions on trust and governance are documented. In general, the literature review suggests that BC has the potential to revolutionize the way in which businesses operate. By improving transparency, efficiency, and security, BC can help businesses to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and make better decisions. This research can help policymakers, industrialists, and researchers to identify where BC governance is being used and which aspects of governance are to be focused on.

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has garnered significant attention in recent years, prompting researchers, entrepreneurs, and businesses to seek viable ways to validate the application of blockchain within their specific use cases. Blockchain decision schemes (BDSs) can assist in this decision-making process, offering a potentially more cost-effective alternative to domain experts. Flow chart blockchain decision schemes (FC-BDSs) constitute 77.5% of all BDSs, and this paper systematically reviews these by standardising and aggregating the most prominent schemes into an open-source package. Central to our approach is the definition of an FC-BDS as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Upon this mathematical foundation, we engage in a meticulous exploration and analysis of various elements within FC-BDSs. We present an in-depth analysis of the structure of FC-BDSs, exploring features such as vertex count, question categorisation, and outcome distribution. Notably, the majority of FC-BDS questions ask about data and participation (34.1%) above other domains such as security (18.6%) and performance (10.8%). Observations regarding outcomes shows an overall balance in suggesting the usage or avoidance of blockchains; however, there is a discrepancy between the average questions required to reach these outcomes, revealing potential biases within schemes. Further analysis using similarity metrics (based on both structural and semantic features) identifies significant overlaps between FC-BDSs, with some schemes showing over 90% similarity. These observations could be attributed to a more informal publishing routine for FC-BDSs, and help trace the evolution of FC-BDSs over time. The insights drawn from this research provide valuable insights into the broader BDSs landscape, and stand to make significant strides towards the standardisation of FC-BDSs, thereby promoting a more coherent and effective utilisation of these decision-making tools in the realm of blockchain technology application.},

However, these methods often involve transaction fees, potential delays, and security concerns. These methods lack transparency and traceability features, making tracking, authenticating, and verifying payments and their associated records difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based online payment system that leverages blockchain technology (BT) features and security to revolutionize financial expenses in the education sector. We also present wallet generation, fee tokenization and NFT generation processes. These processes utilize Ethereum and an interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store metadata information associated with fee payment details securely. We use Remix IDE, MetaMask wallet, and Sepolia test network to deploy and analyze the proposed system's results. We have also used the JMeter simulation toolkit to conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of throughput, latency, and response time. Our assessment identifies the increase in performance parameters with the number of users.

FinTech has proven its true potential in traditional financial offerings by delivering digital financial services to individuals worldwide. The pandemic has accelerated how people interact with financial services and has resulted in long-term changes to societies and economies. FinTech has expanded access to financial services and has made such changes possible. FinTech or Financial Technology refers to using new technologies for financial services. Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and cloud computing are a few technologies currently being applied to FinTech. In this paper, we consider FinTech, which partly uses blockchain technology. Blockchain technology plays a vital role in the financial sector as it ultimately lifts trust and the need for third-party verification by using consensus-based verification. This survey provides a comprehensive summary of the most relevant blockchain-based FinTech implementations and an overview of FinTech sectors and segments. For each segment, we provide a critique and a discussion on how each blockchain implementation contributes to solving the majority of problems faced by FinTech companies and researchers. This research aims to direct the future of financial solutions by providing an outline of the applications of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology (DLT) for FinTech. We discuss various implementations, limitations, and challenges of blockchain-based FinTech applications. We conclude this work by exploring possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and future research directions.},

 abstract = {Background
Gender and sexual diversity (GSD) individuals are at increased risk of negative health outcomes and suffer health inequities and discrimination. Many GSD individuals do not seek healthcare for fear of being discriminated against and do not disclose this part of their identity to their health care providers, leading to diagnostic or prescription errors. The objective of our study is to improve understanding of the primary health care needs of GSD individuals.
Methods
This qualitative study relied on semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of GSD individuals recruited through community associations and medical offices in Geneva. Interviews were based on the critical incident technique. Thematic analysis of interview content involved all researchers. GSD community members informed the content of the interview guide, the recruitment process and the results validation.
Findings
Interviews took place with 19 GSD individuals, of whom 7 identified as cisgender, 8 as transgender, 5 as non-binary, 1 as intersex and 3 as in questioning (4 stated double identification). They self-categorized as being gay (4), lesbian (5), bisexual (1), pansexual (4), queer (2), queer bisexual (1), lesbian non binary (1) and in questioning (1). Their age ranged from 25 to 56 years (mean 36.31). The main primary care consultation challenges for GSD patients were: revelation of GSD status, feeling categorized, marginalized or discriminated against, and dealing with physician embarrassment or lack of competence regarding the GSD health issues. These challenges impacted negatively medical treatment and health prevention. To overcome these challenges they proposed measures to improve physicians’ knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding GSD patients, and structural measures for GSD-friendly medical offices.
Discussion
Exploring health experiences of GSD patients in primary care identified that the key issues impacting their health care are related to doctor-patient communication. They provide practical, individual and structural solutions for secure and inclusive health care.},

To this end, we undertake an integrative literature review that reveals three main principles—decentralized, automated and autonomous organizations—and the following four theoretical perspectives mainly adopted to examine this novel organizational form: transaction cost theory, institutions for collective action, agency theory, and socio-materiality. By extending these theories, we propose an integrative model of DAO for research and theory building.

The paper outlines two core problems, which were inspired by recent legislative activities in Belarus and Russia. The first is a possible displacement of existing legal regimes of objects of civil rights by the legal regime of the token. Secondly, the problem of definition of the nature of rights to tokens arises (in rem versus ad personam) as well as remedies for their violations. Provisions of the Belarus Decree “On the development of digital economy” of 21 December 2017 and drafts of the laws on blockchain and ICO, discussed in Russian Parliament and Government are taken to illustrate these problems.},

However, current practices are inadequate for both effectiveness and efficiency since they mainly depend on centralized authority. This paper is designed in two folds; first, a generic blockchain-based online dispute resolution platform is tested with two litigation cases collected in 1999 and 2009 to show the need for a construction-focused system. Then, a new construction-specific framework, Decentralized Construction Enabling Transparent Resolution (DCENTR), is proposed to address the unique nature of construction projects. Ultimately, it is shown that dispute likelihood can be minimized through reliable contract and payment execution, and if occurred, construction disputes can be resolved with higher transparency and dramatic savings in effort, time, and cost.},

 abstract = {Societies at large still grapple to categorize digital space as a phenomenon. At the same time, scientists and developers are searching for innovative methods to better understand how the fundamental shifts caused by digital change will affect the future of humanity over the coming decades. Interdisciplinary governance research at the intersection of technological and environmental foresight is urgently needed to minimize the risks of technological change and explore how digitalization may support, hinder or re-shape sustainability transformations. In this article, we focus on the case of ‘blockchain’ or distributed-ledger technology (DLT) to investigate how recent digital technologies may support the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. Our investigation is centered on areas of public administration and governance which will most likely see an adoption of DLT over the next two decades, such as digital identity, social service provision, and innovative climate finance. To allow for a meaningful comparison of various use cases, we propose four guiding questions that can help researchers, decision-makers and practitioners to determine whether DLT might be an appropriate choice for the sustainability-related task at hand. Moreover, we illustrate how the initial design and subsequent implementation of DLTs may support more centralized or networked modes of governance.},

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.},

 abstract = {In recent years, on the one hand, we have witnessed the rise of blockchain technology, which has led to better transparency, traceability, and therefore, trustworthy exchange of digital assets among different actors. On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.},

Smart contracts, powered by blockchain, can be developed by using the AI capabilities. These contracts can execute themselves based on predefined conditions, automating various processes and reducing the need for intermediaries. Blockchain provides a transparent and immutable ledger for supply chain transactions. AI can be integrated to analyze this data, providing insights into the entire supply chain. This helps in tracking and tracing products, ensuring authenticity, and optimizing the supply chain based on data-driven decisions. AI algorithms can be employed to analyze data from the manufacturing process recorded on the blockchain. This allows for predictive maintenance and quality control, helping to identify and address issues before they result in defects or downtime. AI and blockchain can work together to secure the massive amount of data generated by IoT devices in an Industry 4.0 setting. Blockchain ensures the integrity and immutability of IoT data, while AI can analyze this data for insights and optimization. AI and blockchain can facilitate the creation of decentralized energy grids where AI algorithms optimize energy distribution and blockchain ensures transparent and secure energy trading through smart contracts. AI and blockchain can support decentralized and collaborative manufacturing networks where different entities can securely and efficiently collaborate on production processes. Blockchain enables individuals or organizations to securely monetize their data. AI can help analyze and determine the value of data, ensuring fair compensation in tokenized ecosystems.

 abstract = {The integration of blockchain technology in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for sustainable supply chain management in the context of Industry 4.0 offers several potential benefits. A public and auditable record of the environmental impact of each supply chain stage can be made using blockchain technology. A more streamlined and effective supply chain is made possible by blockchain's decentralized structure. Delays, mistakes, and the need for middlemen are decreased by real-time access to a shared ledger. IIoT devices like sensors and RFID tags can provide real-time data on the location, condition, and environmental parameters of goods. Blockchain can then be used to record and incentivize sustainable practices, such as reducing energy consumption or minimizing waste. The integration of blockchain with IIoT can develop the supply chain management for enabling real-time tracking of goods, optimizing inventory management, and ensuring compliance with sustainability standards. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the key challenges facing traditional supply chains and how the combined use of Blockchains and IIoT technologies. The review also evaluates the environmental, social, and economic implications of adopting Blockchain-enabled IIoT solutions in supply chain operations. Furthermore, the review assesses the current state of research and development, identifying gaps in existing literature and proposing avenues for future exploration. As a results, by highlighting the synergies between these technologies, it seeks to inspire further innovation and adoption, ultimately fostering a more resilient, transparent, and environmentally conscious industrial ecosystem.},

But how might project management supported by blockchain technology look like? And how would such a new form change and affect traditional project management? Not many concepts have been designed or even implemented yet. We chose an experimental framework to answer the first aspects of these questions. We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.},

Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.},

 abstract = {Scientific publishing systems (SPS) provides platforms to authors, reviewers, and editors to express research for the betterment of the community. Traditionally, the research databases are assigned electronic identifiers, and manuscripts are preserved in electronic form. Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.},

 abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.},

 abstract = {Public auditing enables data owners to entrust a third-party auditor (TPA) to perform auditing tasks periodically. To resist malicious TPAs, a plethora of blockchain-based public auditing mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot effectively mitigate single point of failure and collusion between TPAs and miners. These schemes are burdened by significant wastage of storage resources due to the presence of redundant data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized auditing scheme supporting ciphertext deduplication (BDACD). BDACD leverages a decentralized blockchain, which takes over the role traditionally played by a centralized TPA. A decentralized autonomous organization is incorporated to enhance resistance against collusion attacks. By integrating advanced ciphertext deduplication techniques, BDACD effectively mitigates storage overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept, T-Merkle hash tree, along with a corresponding search algorithm. This innovation significantly enhances blockchain storage utilization and enables efficient half-interval searches within a block. To ensure accountability and fairness, a smart contract is employed to establish an arbitration mechanism. This mechanism serves a dual purpose: penalizing any malevolent actions by cloud servers and providing adequate compensation to data owners whose data integrity has been compromised. Detailed security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate BDACD has desirable security and efficiency.},

 abstract = {Integrating blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT) for security is a new development in computational communication systems. While security threats are changing their strategies and constructing new threats on blockchain-based IoT systems. Also, in combining blockchain with IoT networks, malicious transactions and active attacks deliver more vulnerabilities, privacy issues, and security threats. The concept of blockchain-based IoT attacks is a hot topic in both IoT and blockchain disciplines. Network attacks are a type of security and privacy threat and cover the exact scope of threats related to the combination of IoT and blockchain. Even though blockchain has potential security benefits, new cyberattacks have emerged that make blockchain alone insufficient to deal with threats and attacks in IoT networks since vagueness and ambiguity issues are unavoidable in IoT data. The heterogeneous nature of IoT sources has made uncertainty a critical issue in IoT networks. Deep Learning (DL) models have difficulty dealing with uncertainty issues and cannot manage them efficiently as an essential tool in security techniques. Thus, we need better security, privacy, and practical approaches, such as efficient threat detection against network attacks in blockchain-based IoT environments. Also helpful to consider fuzzy logic to tackle deterministic issues when DL models face uncertainty. This paper designs and implements a secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework. This framework utilizes a novel fuzzy DL model, optimized adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based attack detection, fuzzy matching (FM), and fuzzy control system (FCS) for detection of network attacks. The proposed fuzzy DL applies the fuzzy Choquet integral to have a powerful nonlinear aggregation function in the detection. We use metaheuristic algorithms to optimize the attack detection error function in ANFIS. We also validate transactions via FM to tackle fraud detection and efficiency in the blockchain layer. This framework is the first secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework that identifies and detects security threats while considering uncertainty issues in IoT networks and having more flexibility in decision-making and accepting transactions in the blockchain layer. Evaluation results verify the efficiency of the blockchain layer in throughput and latency metrics and the intelligent fuzzy layer in performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score) in threat detection on both blockchain and IoT network sides. Additionally, FCS demonstrates that we obtain an effective system (stable model) for threat detection in blockchain-based IoT networks.},

@article{ZACHARIADIS2019105,
 abstract = {As blockchain platforms are becoming increasingly noticeable in financial services and beyond, questions arise regarding their suitability to compete with or replace existing payment systems and marketplaces and redesign the financial infrastructures of the future. Prominent among these concerns are issues around governance and control in distributed ledgers: How are distributed ledger technologies governed? Can blockchains address complex administration problems? What key issues of note for practitioners and academics have emerged thus far? In this paper we aim to review the existing governance practices of established or popular blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems with a view to understanding how they hold up in times of crises. What questions are raised when they are compromised or faced consensus challenges in coordinating action especially around control and accountability? We use a translational process, generating focal insights about present concerns from the reference point of completed academic studies and extensive practitioner consultation. Rather than adopting a declarative approach attempting to provide all the answers, we draw insights from the IT platform governance literature to offer a critical perspective for asking the right questions around key governance issues in financial infrastructure such as decision rights, control mechanisms, and incentives.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, with the emergence of Web 3.0 and the metaverse, we collectively witnessed the explosive development of the decentralised autonomous organisation and the blockchain business model. Particularly, the advancement of technologies has further given birth to a novel form of social platform as blockchain-enabled social media (i.e., SocialFi), which is growing both in size and number of users. Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field. Using the case of Pixie – the world’s first fully functional decentralised photo and video sharing social network based on blockchain technology, this insight paper identifies a conceptual model of blockchain-enabled social media that is useful for illustrating the successful business strategy and operations of firms. Particularly, the identified model employs four pillars of innovation as fundamental technologies, governance and operations, incentive mechanism design, and organisational structure and performance. Based on this crypto economy social media model, the study further presents the main challenges, discusses the implications based on agency theory, as well as highlights several directions for future research associated with blockchain-enabled social media.},

@article{ZHOU2022108318,
 abstract = {Information technologies, such as blockchain, have promoted the development of decentralized decision-making in complex systems and generated many decentralized autonomous organizations. We construct a set of decentralized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models based on the basic decentralized decision mode of “votingmajority”, and we consider the assumptions that DMUs have no prior information about other DMUs’ decisions, and that they do. Then, the process of decision-making for each decision making unit (DMU) can be viewed as a social behavior over multiple time periods. Using a numerical example, we demonstrate that the new DEA models can provide acceptable efficiency results with specific weights for each DMU and can describe the details of the consensus relationship among DMUs. Similar to the market mechanism in reality, the efficiency scores of DMUs within an alliance containing more than half of the participants are overestimated, at the expense of nonallied DMUs. The models in this paper provide a possible path for efficiency measurement based on decentralized decision-making principles in complex systems.},

@article{ZHU2014169,
 abstract = {Approaching policy research from a cultural perspective, this paper proposes that understanding engineering education practice and policymaking in China requires considerable sensitivity to context. By adopting a historical–philosophical analysis methodology, this paper analyzes how three fundamental concepts (engineering, engineer, and education) are linked to a variety of beliefs, assumptions, and ideas that are partially unique to the Chinese cultural context. More specifically, these concepts are discussed in relation to three partially distinct philosophical frameworks: Confucianism, Marxism, and economic pragmatism. Our analysis in this paper draws on studies in comparative education and Chinese studies as well as policy reports released by the Central Government. Based on the analysis, the paper suggests taking a cultural approach to studying engineering education policy, with important implications for both Chinese and Western scholars and policymakers. This paper should be of interest to comparative education scholars, international engineering educators, and education policymakers with a global focus.},

@article{ZUTSHI2021107187,
 abstract = {Since the last few years there has been a massive spurt of Research on Blockchain Technologies and several attempts at incorporating them for a myriad of Business Applications. Blockchain Technologies promised to bring about decentralized trust having the potential to disrupt digital ecosystems by providing alternatives to centralized storage and management of data. This has the potential to radically transform industries and services through new models of data storage, transparency, tracking, payment systems amongst other advantages. However, Blockchain Technology is designed to provide other Value Propositions beyond decentralized storage, such as innovative crypto economic and investment models and radical new forms of decentralized participative governance models that could lead to the evolution of new generation of Digital Platforms and multi stakeholder business interactions. In this paper, through a systematic literature review, we present a set of key Blockchain Value Propositions and a discussion on how it can complement to the evolution of Digital Platforms and the Collaborative Economy. We also argue that while some of the value propositions are easier to integrate with existing Digital Platforms, more disruptive value propositions such as Business Automation, Economic and Governance Models present greater challenges but could lead to not just innovation at the technological level, but also metamorphosis of the existing social, economic and governance models.},
