abstract = {This session represents a "first of a kind" for a major computer conference. The session is devoted entirely to formal technological forecasting and assessment efforts dealing with the computer industry. Technological forecasting as an autonomous discipline, with its own set of methodologies and techniques, is only about five years old. Of course, similar efforts have taken place over the years within the long range planning staffs of most technology-oriented companies and organizations. Furthermore, the intuitive judgment of recognized experts is a technological forecasting technique that has always been with us and has been well represented at these meetings by various panel presentations. What appears to be really new is a growing recognition of the need to examine potential futures systematically in order to assess a wide variety of concerns and potential consequences of technological development. The days of looking only for profit related effects seem to be passing into history. Because the scope of concern has significantly widened, with an accompanying increase in the complexity of the required analyses, new approaches to forecasting have been sought.},

abstract = {The rapidly growing demand for wireless communication makes efficient power allocation a critical factor in the network's efficient operation. Power allocation in decentralized wireless systems, where the transmission of a user creates interference to other users and directly affects their utilities, has been recently studied by pricing methods. However, pricing methods do not result in efficient/optimal power allocations for such systems for the following reason. Systems where a user's actions directly affect the utilities of other users are known to have externalities. It is well known from Mas-Colell et al. that in systems with externalities, standard efficiency theorems on market equilibrium do not apply and pricing methods do not result in Pareto optimal outcomes. In this paper, we formulate the power allocation problem for a wireless network as an allocation problem with "externalities." We consider a system where each user knows only its own utility and the channel gains from the transmitters of other users to its own receiver. The system has multiple interference temperature constraints to control interference. We present a decentralized algorithm to allocate transmission powers to the users. The algorithm takes into account the externality generated to the other users by the transmission of each user, satisfies the informational constraints of the system, overcomes the inefficiency of pricing mechanisms and guarantees convergence to globally optimal power allocations.},

abstract = {Blockchains have become a popular technology for lowering the trust-tax burden between transacting parties that cannot necessarily trust each other. They are used as substitutes for the centralized authorities typically incorporated in transactional workflows to perform verification tasks and have the advantage of being objective and incorruptible. For applications such as supply chain marketplaces, auxilliary functionalities beyond the core blockchain roles of recording and validating transactions such as event detection are important for enabling application participants be responsive to business conditions. Unfortunately, existing blockchain event frameworks are immature, syntactic, inflexible and not expressive enough for many application needs.In this paper, we propose an approach that involves an event model which "semantifies blockchain transactions" and an implementation architecture that integrates a open-source blockchain database BigChainDB with a semantic engine and publish-subscribe messaging platform. Finally, we model and simulate a use-case inspired from the manufacturing domain and present usability and preliminary performance results that demonstrate the discriminatory ability of semantics-enabled event model.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enable new forms of business collaboration while the combination with smart contracts allows for an automation of business and collaboration processes. The immutability of DLT secures the execution of business processes. Hence, any process automation or resource management activities are tamper-proof. Yet, a widespread use can only takeoff, if business process experts can directly use this new form of technology, since business process experts are not necessarily programming experts. Thus, we argue for a high-level business process modeling to allow an application-oriented formulation of business collaboration. Hence it is important to research the instantiation and execution of business processes on DLTs, which are formulated in conventional notations.Existing approaches for process implementation on DLTs build-upon state machines that encode the process flow in smart contracts. Thereby every process instantiation requires the creation of a new smart contract with its state machine. In contrast we propose a variant of process implementation that builds-upon an extending kernel. The execution logic is encoded as a core function in the validation routine of DLT nodes. Going down this avenue, the process flow is specified inside transactions and the validation routine will ensure that the process is correctly executed. We validate the implementation of our approach and compare it to alternatives that implement processes by state machines across smart contracts.},

abstract = {We study randomized algorithms for placing a sequence of
n nodes on a circle with unit perimeter. Nodes divide the
circle into disjoint arcs. We desire that a newly-arrived node
(which is oblivious of its index in the sequence) choose its
position on the circle by learning the positions of as few existing
nodes as possible. At the same time, we desire that that the
variation in arc-lengths be small. To this end, we propose a new
algorithm that works as follows: The kth node
chooses r random points on the circle, inspects the sizes of
v arcs in the vicinity of each random point, and places
itself at the mid-point of the largest arc encountered. We show
that for any combination of r and v satisfying
rv ¡\'{Y} c log k, where c is
a small constant, the ratio of the largest to the smallest
arc-length is at most eight w.h.p., for an arbitrarily long
sequence of n nodes. This strategy of node placement
underlies a novel decentralized load-balancing algorithm that we
propose for Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) in peer-to-peer
environments.Underlying the analysis of our algorithm is &lt;i&gt;Structured
Coupon Collection&lt;/i&gt; over &lt;i&gt;n/b&lt;/i&gt; disjoint
cliques with &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; nodes per clique, for any
&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; ≥ 1. Nodes are
initially uncovered. At each step, we choose &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
nodes independently and uniformly at random. If all the nodes in
the corresponding cliques are covered, we do nothing. Otherwise,
from among the chosen cliques with at least one uncovered node, we
select one at random and cover an uncovered node within that
clique. We show that as long as &lt;i&gt;bd&lt;/i&gt; ≥
&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; log &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;,
&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) steps are sufficient to
cover all nodes w.h.p. and each of the first
Ω(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) steps succeeds in covering a node
w.h.p. These results are then utilized to analyze a stochastic
process for growing binary trees that are highly balanced -- the
leaves of the tree belong to at most four different levels with
high probability.},

abstract = {Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) systems have been widely adopted in highly scalable environments. We see this especially with IoT/IIoT applications, an environment where low bandwidth and high latency is ideal. The projected growth of Iot/IIoT network nodes are in the billions in the next few years and as such, there is a need for network communication standards that can adapt to the evergrowing nature of this industry. While current pub/sub standards have produced positive results so far, they all adopt a "topic" based pub/sub approach. They do not leverage off modern devices having spatial information. Current open-source standards also focus heavily on centralized brokering of information. This makes the broker in this system a potential bottleneck as it means if that broker goes down, the entire network goes down. We have developed a new, unique and innovative open-source pub/sub standard called VAST that leverages spatial information of modern network devices to perform message communication. It uses a unique concept called Spatial Publish/Subscribe (SPS). It is built on a peer-to-peer network to enable high scalability. In addition to this, it provides a Voronoi Overlay to efficiently distribute the messages, ensuring that network brokers are not overloaded with requests and ensures the network self-organizes itself if one or more brokers break down. It also has a forwarding algorithm to eliminate redundancies in the network. We will demonstrate this concept with a simulator we developed. We will show how the simulator works and how to use it. We believe that with this simulator, we will help encourage researchers adopt this technology for their spatial applications. An example of such is Massively Multi-user Virtual Environments (MMVEs), where there is a need for a high number of spatial network nodes in virtual environments.},

abstract = {Clinical trials and drug discovery would not be effective without the collaboration of institutions. Earlier, it has been at the cost of individual’s privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant’s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the concept of in-place model training by keeping the data intact to the device. Though it is privacy-preserving in nature, however, it is susceptible to inference, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. Blockchain is a decentralized programming paradigm that provides a broader control of the system, making it attack resistant. It poses challenges of high computing power, storage, and latency. These emerging technologies can contribute to the desired learning system and motivate them to address their security and efficiency issues. This article systematizes the security issues in Federated Learning, its corresponding mitigation strategies, and Blockchain’s challenges. Further, a Blockchain-based Federated Learning architecture with two layers of participation is presented, which improves the global model accuracy and guarantees participant’s privacy. It leverages the channel mechanism of Blockchain for parallel model training and distribution. It facilitates establishing decentralized trust between the participants and the gateways using the Blockchain, which helps to have only honest participants.},

Our protocols rely on a novel non-malleable timed commitment scheme which efficiently supports range proofs to establish that bidders have sufficient funds to cover a hidden bid value. This allows us to penalize users who abandon bids for exactly the bid value, while supporting simultaneous bidding in multiple auctions with a shared collateral pool. Our protocols are concretely efficient and we have implemented them in an Ethereum-compatible smart contract which automatically enforces payment and delivery of an auctioned digital asset.},

AI, famous for its big data processing ability, will enable the FWN to self-update itself to better adapt to the dynamic network condition. Blockchain, as a distributed ledger, can guarantee data integrity, security and privacy. In this survey, we overview the concept of AI and blockchain and present their state-of-the-art applications in wireless networks. The potential of AI and blockchain is still huge and waiting to be fully explored in wireless networks. Therefore, we introduce how AI and blockchain can assist each other in FWNs. Furthermore, we explore the current constraints of applying both technologies in the FWNs. In the final part, we discuss the future direction of the deployment of AI and blockchain in FWNs.},

abstract = {As the volume and complexity of distributed online work increases, collaboration among people who have never worked together in the past is becoming increasingly necessary. Recent research has proposed algorithms to maximize the performance of online collaborations by grouping workers in a top-down fashion and according to a set of predefined decision criteria. This approach often means that workers have little say in the collaboration formation process. Depriving users of control over whom they will work with can stifle creativity and initiative-taking, increase psychological discomfort, and, overall, result in less-than-optimal collaboration results—especially when the task concerned is open-ended, creative, and complex. In this work, we propose an alternative model, called Self-Organizing Pairs (SOPs), which relies on the crowd of online workers themselves to organize into effective work dyads. Supported but not guided by an algorithm, SOPs are a new human-centered computational structure, which enables participants to control, correct, and guide the output of their collaboration as a collective. Experimental results, comparing SOPs to two benchmarks that do not allow user agency, and on an iterative task of fictional story writing, reveal that participants in the SOPs condition produce creative outcomes of higher quality, and report higher satisfaction with their collaboration. Finally, we find that similarly to machine learning-based self-organization, human SOPs exhibit emergent collective properties, including the presence of an objective function and the tendency to form more distinct clusters of compatible collaborators.},

Finding ways for distinct CDNs to coordinate and cooperate with other CDNs is necessary to achieve better overall service, as perceived by end-users, at lower cost. In this paper, we present an architecture to support peering arrangements among CDN providers, based on a Virtual Organization (VO) model. Our approach promotes peering among providers, reduces expenditure, while upholding user perceived performance. This is achieved through proper policy management of negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLAs) among peers. In addition, scalability and resource sharing among CDNs is improved through effective peering, thus evolving past the current landscape where "islands" of CDNs exist. We also show analytically that significant performance improvement can be achieved through the peering of CDNs.},

abstract = {Virtual coordinate systems provide an accurate and efficient service that allows hosts on the Internet to determine the latency to arbitrary hosts without actively monitoring all of the nodes in the network. Many of the proposed systems were designed with the assumption that all of the nodes are altruistic. However, this assumption may be violated by compromised nodes acting maliciously to degrade the accuracy of the coordinate system. As numerous peer-to-peer applications come to rely on virtual coordinate systems to achieve good performance, it is critical to address the security of such systems.In this work, we demonstrate the vulnerability of decentralized virtual coordinate systems to insider (or Byzantine) attacks. We propose techniques to make the coordinate assignment robust to malicious attackers without increasing the communication cost. We use both spatial and temporal correlations to perform context-sensitive outlier analysis to reject malicious updates and prevent unnecessary and erroneous adaptations. We demonstrate the attacks and mitigation techniques in the context of a well-known virtual coordinate system using simulations based on three representative, real-life Internet topologies of hosts and corresponding Round Trip Times (RTT). We show the effects of the attacks and the utility of the mitigation techniques on the virtual coordinate system as seen by higher-level applications, elucidating the utility of deploying robust virtual coordinate systems as network services.},

abstract = {Energy is the scarcest resource in ad hoc wireless networks, particularly in wireless sensor networks requiring a long lifetime. Intermittently switching the radio on and off is widely adopted as the most effective way to keep energy consumption low. This, however, prevents the very goal of communication, unless nodes switch their radios on at synchronized intervals—a rather nontrivial coordination task. In this article, we address the problem of synchronizing node radios to a single universal schedule in wireless mobile ad hoc networks that can potentially consist of thousands of nodes. More specifically, we are interested in operating the network with duty cycles that can be less than 1\% of the total cycle time. We identify the fundamental issues that govern cluster merging and provide a detailed comparison of various policies using extensive simulations based on a variety of mobility patterns. We propose a specific scheme that allows a 4,000-node network to stay synchronized with a duty cycle of approximately 0.7\%. Our work is based on an existing, experimental MAC protocol that we use for real-world applications and is validated in a real network of around 120 mobile nodes.},

abstract = {Load balancing is essential for efficient utilization of resources and enhancing the performance of computational grid. Job migration is an effective way to dynamically balance the load among multiple clusters in the grid environment. Due to limited capacity of single cluster, it is necessary to share the underutilized resources of other clusters. Each cluster saves information about its neighbors including the transfer delay available between the local resource and its neighbor and the load value of its neighbor. This paper addresses the issues in multi cluster load balancing based on job migration across separate clusters. A decentralized grid model, as a collection of clusters for computational grid environment is proposed. A Sender Initiated Decentralized Dynamic Load Balancing (SI-DDLB) algorithm is introduced. The algorithm estimates system parameters such as the resource processing rate, load on each resource and then balance the load by migrating jobs to the least loaded neighbor resource by taking into account of transfer delay. The main goal of the proposed algorithm is to improve the average response times of jobs. The proposed algorithm has been verified through the GridSim simulation toolkit and compared with the Non Migration (NM) algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields better performance when compared with the NM algorithm.},

abstract = {Replicating or caching popular content in memories distributed across the network is a technique to reduce peak network loads. Conventionally, the main performance gain of this caching was thought to result from making part of the requested data available closer to end-users. Instead, we recently showed that a much more significant gain can be achieved by using caches to create coded-multicasting opportunities, even for users with different demands, through coding across data streams. These coded-multicasting opportunities are enabled by careful content overlap at the various caches in the network, created by a central coordinating server. In many scenarios, such a central coordinating server may not be available, raising the question if this multicasting gain can still be achieved in a more decentralized setting. In this paper, we propose an efficient caching scheme, in which the content placement is performed in a decentralized manner. In other words, no coordination is required for the content placement. Despite this lack of coordination, the proposed scheme is nevertheless able to create coded-multicasting opportunities and achieves a rate close to the optimal centralized scheme.},

The choice of MAGNET is based on its uniqueness to handle auctions for allocation of tasks which include time windows and precedence constraints.Empirical evaluations based on real data obtained from a logistics company show that the system performs well. The costs of the allocations obtained by our approach are on average within 5\% from the optimal allocation.

Also, we assume the players have no direct means of communication. This model extends the standard stochastic multiarmed bandit framework to a decentralized multiple player setting with competition. We introduce a new algorithm for this setting that, over a time horizon T, attains O(log(T)) stable regret when preferences of the arms over players are shared, and O(log(T)2) regret when there are no assumptions on the preferences on either side. Moreover, in the setting where a single player may deviate, we show that the algorithm is incentive compatible whenever the arms' preferences are shared, but not necessarily so when preferences are fully general.},

In these systems, agents have a select set of other agents with whom they interact based on environmental knowledge, cognitive capabilities, resource limitations, and communications constraints. Previous findings have demonstrated that the structure of the artificial social network governing the agent interactions is strongly correlated with organizational performance. As multi-agent systems are typically embedded in dynamic environments, we wish to develop distributed, on-line network adaptation mechanisms for discovering effective network structures.

abstract = {Managing the privileges of occupants and visitors of large commercial buildings to access different building areas, control systems and equipment therein is a challenging task. The best practice today involves giving long-term building occupants, for example employees working in the building, access privileges to their organization areas and requiring visitors to be escorted by them. This approach is conservative and inflexible. Ideally, an automated solution is needed to manage access delegations; however, traditional role-based access control models are unwieldy in that they require the specification of all roles and their relative authority, which is a challenge in large buildings home of multiple organizations and numerous visitors. In this paper, we present a methodology based on blockchain smart contracts to describe, grant, and revoke fine-grained permissions for building users in a decentralized fashion. This method supports access control using resource description framework (RDF) graphs and implements two APIs for client applications. Leveraging the metadata of a real building, we have applied the proposed method to manage privileges in some realistic use-cases and shown that it can greatly reduce the administration overhead while providing fine-grained access control.},

An FLS is a drone with light sources that illuminates a shape. Groups of G FLSs may implement reliability techniques to tolerate FLS failures, provide kinesthetic haptic feedback in response to a user’s touch, and facilitate a divide and conquer approach to challenges such as localizing FLSs to render a shape. This paper evaluates four decentralized techniques to form groups. An FLS implements a technique autonomously using asynchronous communication and without a global clock. We evaluate these techniques using synthetic point clouds with known optimal solutions and real point clouds. Obtained results show a technique named Random Subset (RS) is superior when constructing small groups (G ≤ 5) while a different technique named Closest Available Neighbor First (CANF) is superior when constructing large groups (G ≥ 10).},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed growing consolidation of web operations. For example, the majority of web traffic now originates from a few organizations, and even micro-websites often choose to host on large pre-existing cloud infrastructures. In response to this, the "Decentralized Web" attempts to distribute ownership and operation of web services more evenly. This paper describes the design and implementation of the largest and most widely used Decentralized Web platform --- the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) --- an open-source, content-addressable peer-to-peer network that provides distributed data storage and delivery. IPFS has millions of daily content retrievals and already underpins dozens of third-party applications. This paper evaluates the performance of IPFS by introducing a set of measurement methodologies that allow us to uncover the characteristics of peers in the IPFS network. We reveal presence in more than 2700 Autonomous Systems and 152 countries, the majority of which operate outside large central cloud providers like Amazon or Azure. We further evaluate IPFS performance, showing that both publication and retrieval delays are acceptable for a wide range of use cases. Finally, we share our datasets, experiences and lessons learned.},

Under this framework, we formulate the prediction problem as matrix completion, whereby unknown entries of an incomplete matrix of pairwise measurements are to be predicted. This problem can be solved by matrix factorization because performance matrices have a low rank, thanks to the correlations among measurements. Moreover, its resolution can be fully decentralized without actually building matrices nor relying on special landmarks or central servers.In this paper we demonstrate that this approach is also applicable when the performance values are not measured exactly, but are only known to belong to one among some predefined performance classes, such as "good" and "bad". Such classification-based formulation not only fulfills the requirements of many Internet applications but also reduces the measurement cost and enables a unified treatment of various performance metrics. We propose a decentralized approach based on Stochastic Gradient Descent to solve this class-based matrix completion problem. Experiments on various datasets, relative to two kinds of metrics, show the accuracy of the approach, its robustness against erroneous measurements and its usability on peer selection.},

abstract = {In several emerging applications, data is collected in massive streams at several distributed points of observation. A basic and challenging task is to allow every node to monitor a neighbourhood of interest by issuing continuous aggregate queries on the streams observed in its vicinity. This class of algorithms is fully decentralized and diffusive in nature: collecting all data at few central nodes of the network is unfeasible in networks of low capability devices or in the presence of massive data sets.The main difficulty in designing diffusive algorithms is to cope with duplicate detections. These arise both from the observation of the same event at several nodes of the network and/or receipt of the same aggregated information along multiple paths of diffusion.In this paper, we consider fully decentralized algorithms that answer locally continuous aggregate queries on the number of distinct events, total number of events and the second frequency moment in the scenario outlined above. The proposed algorithms use in the worst case or on realistic distributions sublinear space at every node.We also propose strategies that minimize the communication needed to update the aggregates when new events are observed. We finally present experimental analysis providing evidence for the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithms on realistic simulated scenarios.},

abstract = {Many-core architectures used in embedded systems will contain hundreds of processors in the near future. Already now, it is necessary to study how to manage such systems when dynamically scheduling applications with different phases of parallelism and resource demands. A recent research area called invasive computing proposes a decentralized workload management scheme of such systems: applications may dynamically claim additional processors during execution and release these again, respectively. In this paper, we study how to apply the concepts of invasive computing for realizing decentralized core allocation schemes in homogeneous many-core systems with the goal of maximizing the average speedup of running applications at any point in time. A theoretical analysis based on game theory shows that it is possible to define a core allocation scheme that uses local information exchange between applications only, but is still able to provably converge to optimal results. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that this allocation scheme reduces the overhead in terms of exchanged messages by up to 61.4\% and even the convergence time by up to 13.4\% compared to an allocation scheme where all applications exchange information globally with each other.},

abstract = {In this paper, decentralized scheduling for a cognitive multihop underwater acoustic network with a primary user interference constraint is investigated. The network consists of primary and secondary users, with multihop transmission adopted for both user types to provide reliable communications. Key characteristics of underwater acoustic channels, including large propagation delay, distance-and-frequency dependent attenuation, half-duplex modem and inter-hop interference are taken into account in the design and analysis. In particular, time-slot allocation is found to be more effective than frequency-slot allocation due to distinct features of the underwater channel. The goal of the network scheduling problem is to maximize the end-to-end throughput of the overall system, while limiting the throughput loss of primary users. The framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDP) is applied to formulate the optimization problem, with a computationally intractable optimal solution. Key properties are shown for the objective function, enabling the design of approximate schemes with significant complexity reduction. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly increases system throughput while maintaining the primary throughput loss constraint. Under certain traffic conditions, the throughput gain over frequency-slot allocation schemes can be as high as .},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized access control framework with transitive delegation capabilities that tackles the performance and scalability limitations of the existing state-of-the-art solutions. In order to accomplish this, the proposed solution is anchored in the self-sovereign identity (SSI) paradigm, which embodies a distributed identity management system. By adopting this paradigm, we obviate slow cryptographic premises such as identity-based encryption (IBE) that were used in prior work. Furthermore, we enhance the existing verifiable credentials (VCs) from this paradigm by introducing our own decentralized permission objects to support the concept of transitive delegations. This concept allows delegates to further delegate their access to resources with the same or fewer privileges to other entities within the framework. This renders our solution suitable for diverse scenarios, including applications in decentralized building access management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of transitive delegations in this paradigm. Finally, our performance experiments show a performance enhancement of three orders of magnitude compared to the prevailing state-of-the-art solutions.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a topology independent, scalable information dissemination algorithm for spatio-temporal traffic information such as parking place availability using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) based on Wireless-LAN IEEE 802.11.The algorithm uses periodic broadcasts for information dissemination. Broadcast redundancy is minimized by evaluation of application layer information and aggregation. Due to the spatio-temporal characteristics of parking place information, the spatial distribution of information is limited by utilizing techniques, which take the local relevance and age of information into account.Based on a realistic model of a german city with up to 10000 vehicles, our results show that a decentralized parking place information system works efficiently even with 5\% of vehicles equipped with Wireless-LAN and without the help of any message relaying infrastructure. This fact makes such a non-safety driver assistance application very interesting, especially in the rollout phase of vehicular ad hoc networks.},

abstract = {In 1971, social critic Ivan Illich published Deschooling Society, a controversial work that critiqued mainstream education systems and proposed a radical alternative. While his work remains controversial, re-examining his ideas might advance efforts to design for learning at scale. First, we examine three design principles that emerge from Illich's writing on learning webs: (1) a holistic perspective that incorporates multidisciplinary thinking (in Illich's case, blending philosophy, politics, sociology, economics, theology, and cybernetics), (2) learning webs as a framework for thinking about learning beyond the limitations of school, and (3) broadening our view of what should be scaled (e.g., scaling opportunities rather than content). Second, we discuss three tensions in Illich's work that relate to scaling learning: (1) decentralization vs. centralization, (2) place-based vs. online learning at scale, and (3) serving the advantaged vs. the disadvantaged. In discussing these ideas and tensions, we discuss contemporary technologies and models, which may be seen as similar to learning webs. Finally, we suggest that Illich's work offers an opportunity to further connect work that sits across two related research communities: Learning @ Scale and connected learning.},

In the age of the smartphone, mobile user scenarios become more and more important for Online Social Networks. Smartphones enable location-based and context-aware services, but bring the increased risk of privacy violations - at least in centralized OSN architectures. Decentralized Online Social Network architectures are promising as they inherently offer better privacy and less dependence on a single service provider, but they bring new challenges regarding core features of Online Social Networks. In this paper, we introduce a three-tiered view of the social graph and propose a new architecture for decentralized Online Social Networking applications, supporting the three-tiered view and focusing on location-based and context-aware user scenarios.},

abstract = {The ongoing industrialization and rising technology adoption around the world are leading to ever higher energy consumption. The benefits of electrification are enormous, but the growing demand also comes with challenges with respect to associated greenhouse gas emissions. Although continuing progress in energy research has brought up new technologies in energy generation, storage, and distribution, most of those technologies focus on increasing efficiency of individual components. Work on integration and coordination abilities between individual components in micro-grids will lead to further improvements and gains in efficiency that are necessary to reduce carbon footprints and slow down climate change. To this end, the CityLearn environment provides a simulation framework that allows the control of energy components in buildings that are organized in districts. In this paper, we propose an energy management system based on the decentralized actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm MARLISA but integrate a centralized critic and call it MARLISADSCC. In this way, we are training a model to autonomously control the energy storage of individual buildings in a CityLearn district to improve demand response guided by a better informed training signal. We show performance increases over baseline control techniques for a district but also discuss the resulting action selection for individual buildings.},

abstract = {Crowd Funding is a behavior that raises funds for projects or venture capital by generating a small amount of money from a large number of people. It started late in China, but has rapidly been developeing. At present, the research on crowdfunding in China is still at an early stage and lacks deep-level exploration Those researches mostly focus on the meaning, characteristics, and operating methods of crowd Funding. Therefore, this paper takes crowd Funding literature as the research object, using CiteSpace to map, describe and counts the related keywords and cited references in the target domain. Starting with the cited relations among the existing studies of core database, focusing on weighted documents, this papaer analyzes the relationship of cooccurrence in crowd funding papers, and conductes research hotspots, trends and knowledge structures in the "Crowd Funding" field. The results show that the business economy is the largest research category in crowdfunding, followed by computer science and government laws and regulations, and there are also studies about crowdfunding from the perspective of the environmental ecology science, public management and social science.},

abstract = {This paper combines recent developments in sparse approximation and distributed consensus theory to efficiently perform decentralized localization in wireless networks. To this goal, we exploit the Compressed Sensing (CS) framework, which provides a new paradigm for recovering signals being sparse in some basis by means of a limited amount of random incoherent projections. In particular, we propose a novel decentralized technique that considers the spatial correlations among the received measurements at the base stations (BSs) to provide global accurate position estimation, while reducing significantly the amount of measurements exchanged among the BSs and required for accurate positioning. We exploit the common structure of the received measurements to design a gossip-based algorithm in order to alleviate the effects of radio channel-induced signal variations on the estimation accuracy. Experimental evaluation with real data demonstrates the superiority of the proposed decentralized CS-based localization technique over traditional fingerprinting methods in terms of the achieved positioning accuracy.},

This is because future general-purpose processors are not likely to improve the performance of a single thread of execution; instead, the presence of multiple processor cores on a CPU will improve the performance of groups of threads. In this article, I argue that there is another trend underway, namely integration, which will have a greater near-term impact on developers of system software and applications. This integration, and its likely impact on general-purpose computers, is clearly illustrated in the architecture of modern mobile phones},

abstract = {Gossip algorithms can provide online information about the availability and the state of the resources in supercomputers. These algorithms require minimal computing and storage capabilities at each node and when properly tuned, they are not expected to overload the nodes or the network that connects these nodes. These properties make gossip interesting for future exascale systems. This paper examines the overhead of a decentralized gossip algorithm on the performance of parallel MPI applications running on up to 8192 nodes of an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer. The applications that were used in the experiments include PTRANS and MPI-FFT from the HPCC benchmark suite as well as the coupled weather and cloud simulation model COSMO-SPECS+FD4. In most cases, no gossip overhead was observed when the gossip messages were sent at intervals of 256ms or more. As expected, the overhead that is observed at higher rates is sensitive to the communication pattern of the application and the amount of gossip information being circulated.},

abstract = {Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many challenging issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, in which a trustworthy central authority is needed for coordination. Such an approach incurs many disadvantages, including vulnerability to attacks, lack of credibility, and difficulty in calculating rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the abovementioned issues. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods, and techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work comprehensively surveys challenges, solutions, and future directions for blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes: decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed, and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.},

We use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to evolve response thresholds for a simulated swarm engaged in dynamic task allocation problems: two-dimensional and three-dimensional collective tracking. We show that evolved thresholds not only outperform uniformly distributed thresholds and dynamic thresholds but achieve nearly optimal performance on a variety of tracking problem instances (target paths). More importantly, we demonstrate that thresholds evolved for some problem instances generalize to all other problem instances, eliminating the need to evolve new thresholds for each problem instance to be solved. We analyze the properties that allow these paths to serve as universal training instances and show that they are quite natural.After a priori evolution, the response thresholds in our system are static. The problem instances solved by the swarms are highly dynamic, with schedules of task demands that change over time with significant differences in rate and magnitude of change. That the swarm is able to achieve nearly optimal results refutes the common assumption that a swarm must be dynamic to perform well in a dynamic environment.},
