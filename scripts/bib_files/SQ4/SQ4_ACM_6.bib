abstract = {Blockchain has been recognised as a technological breakthrough with the ability to support new decentralised security-based solutions in sectors such as information technology and finance. Blockchain allows different communities to create Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), which are self-organised democratic organisations controlled by smart contracts. This paper presents a new DAO model for the procurement of services by public organisations, such as government agencies. To demonstrate the advantages of this solution, this work looks specifically at current public procurement systems that resort to third-party contractors that manage these negotiations. Third parties lack the transparency, security, and democratic representation that a DAO can provide. We present the implementation of a DAO as a set of smart contracts executed on Ethereum-compatible permissionless blockchains, supported by a consensus algorithm, replacing third-party contractors.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology enables a new form of online community: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), where members typically vote on proposals using tokens. Enthusiasts claim DAOs provide new opportunities for openness, horizontality, and democratization. However, this phenomenon is still under research, especially given the lack of quantitative studies. This paper presents the first census-like quantitative analysis of the whole ecosystem of DAOs, including 30K DAO communities on the main DAO platforms. This enables us to provide insights into the allegedly "democratic'' nature of DAOs, building metrics concerning their lifespan, participation, and power concentration. Most DAOs have a short lifespan and low participation. There is also a positive correlation between community size and voting power concentration. Like other online communities, DAOs seem to follow the iron law: becoming increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Still, a significant amount of DAOs of varying sizes defy this idea by being egalitarian by design.},

abstract = {The emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represents a paradigm shift in the organizational structure enabled by distributed digital ledger technologies such as blockchain. Exclusively digital web-based entities, DAOs function independently through blockchain-based smart contracts that rely on distributed governance, community coordination, and incentive mechanisms rather than top-down hierarchies. As DAOs continue to foster an environment conducive to a new class of digital participants, they are becoming increasingly prominent in the digital cryptocurrency economy, raising questions regarding their structure, sustainability, and adoption. Being collectively owned and managed by their members, DAOs exhibit characteristics of both non-zero and zero-sum dynamics, thereby posing a challenge to conventional centralized and hierarchical management models. This mixed-methods study examines DAOs within modern information ecosystems through a literature review, blockchain analysis, and comparative organizational analysis. The literature review synthesizes academic discourse on DAOs, highlighting key theories, such as decentralization, digital governance, and distributed decision-making. Blockchain analysis of 10 leading DAOs provides engagement and activity metrics. Comparative analysis considers the DAOs’ advantages and challenges in relation to traditional centralized organizations, focusing on aspects such as governance, efficiency, and adaptability. The findings reveal DAOs' innovative potential and adoption barriers, such as reliance on token incentives and difficulties with coordinated decision-making due to reasons like concentration of voting power and others. Although DAOs possess advantages in terms of decentralization, community alignment, and transparent algorithmic execution, traditional organizations currently maintain superiority in terms of stability and legal standing. This study provides an interdisciplinary academic perspective on the concept and implementation of the DAO by combining conceptual understanding, empirical blockchain evidence, and comparative analysis. It is concluded that realizing the transformative potential of DAOs requires synthesizing multidisciplinary insights and overcoming substantive adoption hurdles. The proposed framework serves as a foundation for further research on the evolution and integration of DAOs into organizations of the future.},

Concretely, we describe DAOs and their governance needs and highlight gaps between the state of the art of MAS research and the governance needs of DAOs.},

Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer. We will illustrate its potential with the case of the DAO Genesis Alpha, which is the main DAO of the DAOstack project.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has enabled a thriving emergent ecosystem of tools and communities actively using decentralized systems. However, most blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum) requires users to pay some fees to execute their desired actions in these novel online services. To which extent an increase in the price of such fees negatively affects user activity? Would significant price surges deter users from using blockchain-enabled online services? In this work, we study the 2020 surge of transaction fee price in the Ethereum network, and analyze how that affected user activities. Our use cases are the blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from the platforms DAOstack and DAOhaus. Thus, we analyzed 5,580 transactions from 7,825 users grouped in 191 DAO communities, using a VAR model with a daily time series of the average fee value and the DAO operations. Our results show just a minor influence of the fee (gas) price and the activity of DAO users. The insensitivity of the activity to the fee price is an anomaly in a supposedly self-regulated market, and we consider this should be tackled in future implementations.},

However, with increasing security breaches and compliance failures with data protection law, researchers have begun to explore the feasibility of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) as a way of reimagining traditional forms of top-down data governance. In this paper, we describe early findings from the development of a card-based approach for engaging the public in the design of DAOs for collectively governing health data. Following a public workshop, we reflect on how our methodological approach involved laypeople in practical discussions about DAO design elements, such as voting mechanisms. Through group conversations, we observed how values affected the kinds of decentralised organisational structures participants wished to engage in. In particular, our analysis has implications for the future directions of DAO design, by pointing towards flexibility and modularity for voting and proposal interfaces, scalability and balancing power in tokenised communities.},

abstract = {This piece explores algorithmic governance as a strength and a vulnerability in the experience of building participatory communities known as "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations". The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation and built cryptographically secure blockchain-based infrastructure to counter this threat. Now, not just on chain transactions are being tracked but every move of participants in blockchain communities. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if mis-used for social control. This piece analyzes the ways in which decentralization efforts can be a threat to themselves by exploring the question, 'Are "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) the next panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in "autonomous" systems?'. By employing ethnographic methods and case study analysis, this piece provides an important qualitative contribution to the early dynamics of the aspirations and problems of decentralized, autonomous organizations.},

Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

Governance tokens are distributed to users of the platform, granting them voting rights in the platform's governance protocol.Many DeFi platforms have already been subject to attacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.  In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.  We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.},

One of the main applications of smart contracts are the so called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), which originated from an idea envisaged by Buterin, in his Ethereum white paper. Indeed, DAOs are decentralized organizations, where the members implement their decisions using smart contracts. In the article, we introduce a simple framework for a DAO, and then we discuss some governance issues. In particular, we focus on how DAO members could be induced to dedicate sufficient time to voting sessions, for a proper functioning of the organization. Indeed, recent empirical research suggests how the members’ participation rate, to voting activities, has a meaningful positive correlation with to a DAO's performance. More specifically, we formalize the notion of attention time and propose a simple model for the so-called Holographic Consensus, a protocol introduced by the DAOStack platform to solve the issue of limited time dedicated to governance, discussing under what conditions DAO members may choose the so-called boosting voting procedure.},

Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

Participative budgeting requires voting about budget allocation by communities and is often confronted with issues in trust and transparency. Yet, DAOs are hardly used for participative budgeting. In this research, we introduce Decentralized Autonomous Citizen Participation Organizations (DACPOs). In a DACPO, data and actions are recorded and autonomously executed in a decentralized way. DACPOs can be used for enabling participative budgeting and thereby provide transparency, decrease the risks of fraud and corruption, and increase citizens’ trust. The viability of DACPOs depends on a number of factors, including a minimum number of citizens who participate. In further research, factors influencing the use of DACPOs for participative budgeting can be further analyzed and tested.},

However, the traceability of blockchain transactions violates voter anonymity in existing proposals. Besides, transaction costs also need to be considered. Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89\% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at .},

abstract = {Traditional Blockchain Sharding approaches can only tolerate up to n/3 of nodes being adversary because they rely on the hyper-geometric distribution to make a failure (an adversary does not have n/3 of nodes globally but can manipulate the consensus of a Shard) hard to happen. The system must maintain a large Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low failure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this paper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up to n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and every Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that this design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one class) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more Shards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The improved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation for decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.},

This system is demonstrated to be able to outperform the highly mature and optimised POSIX backend when used under high load and contention, as per typical forecast workflow I/O patterns.

abstract = {The non-fungible token (NFT) market has experienced significant growth in recent years. Similar to real estate and artwork, NFT is illiquid and it does not have a market price. Thus, there arises a need for a comprehensive scoring system to analyze the value of NFTs. Using a single score is often inadequate, as NFT value is influenced by numerous factors and is assessed based on personal objectives. Addressing the issue, this study explores critical factors influencing NFT value and develops three scores to rank NFTs including rarity, return on investment (ROI), and reputation score. The scores serve to evaluate both NFTs and NFT collections. (i) The rarity score evaluates the level of scarcity, and it applies to NFTs within a collection. (ii) The reputation score evaluates the interest of communities in NFT projects, considering the number of followers and the interaction rate; the score is for NFT collections. (iii) The ROI score assesses the profit generated by NFTs; it applies to both NFTs and NFT collections. Our empirical results show that a well-distributed rarity score of NFTs enhances their demand and profit; high-rarity NFTs are typically associated with a low number of sale transactions. NFT collections with high ROI and high reputation generally draw more attention and yield a positive return. In addition to the three scores, this paper presents a system to collect and process a huge amount of blockchain and social network data for NFT evaluation.},

abstract = {Recent blockchain-technology related innovations enable the governance of collaborating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to engage in agile business-network collaborations that are based on the novel concept of smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely coupled collaboration lifecycle with the main steps of setup, enactment, possible rollbacks and finally, an orderly termination. This lifecycle supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs, smart contract negotiations, and behavior monitoring during enactment with the potential for breach management. Based on a sound understanding of the collaboration lifecycle in a Governance- as-a-Service (GaaS)-platform, a new type of conflict management must safeguard business-semantics induced consistency rules. This conflict management involves breach detection with recovery aspects. To fill the detected gap, we employ a formal design-notation that comprises the definition of structural and behavioral properties for exploring conflict-related exception- and compensation management during a decentralized collaboration. With the formal approach, we generate a highly dependable DAO-GaaS conflict model that does not collapse under left-behind clutter such as orphaned processes and exponentially growing database entries that require an unacceptable periodic GaaS reset.},

abstract = {High performance scale-out storage systems are a critical component of modern HPC and AI clusters. However, characterizing their performance remains challenging: Different client I/O patterns have very different performance scaling behavior, and bottlenecks in the HPC storage software may also limit performance scaling. The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open source scale-out storage system that is designed from the ground up to support Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVMe storage in user space. DAOS has demonstrated leadership performance on IO500. But while IO500 has defined an extensive “standard” set of I/O patterns, a single IO500 run does not provide much insight into how a storage solution scales. This paper investigates the performance scaling behavior of the DAOS storage stack for typical IOR and mdtest workloads, as a function of the storage server hardware and the client-side parallelism. It also analyses the impact of the HPC networking stack (libfabric/verbs and UCX) on the achievable performance.},

We believe that the modularity, reuse, interoperability and portability of this model has much to offer, but that there exist some challenges in overcoming the performance issues inherent in the approach, and extending the range of applications to which it is suited. We are particularly interested in applying the coordination languages to decentralized systems. To this end, blockchain smart contracts are proposed to offer a decentralized trustable method to automatically verify compliance with pre-defined conditions before executing a transaction involving multiple parties. To validate our proposal, we demonstrate a healthcare functional prototypes as a proof of concept.},

abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are powerful platforms for vehicular data services and applications. The increasing number of vehicles has made the vehicular network diverse, dynamic, and large-scale, making it difficult to meet the 5G network’s demanding requirements. Decentralized systems are interesting and provide attractive services because they are publicly available (transparency), have an append-only ledger (robust integrity protection), remove single points of failure, and enable distributed key management and communication in a peer-to-peer network. Researchers dedicated substantial efforts to advancing vehicle communications, however conventional cryptographic mechanisms are insufficient which enabled us to look at decentralized technologies. Therefore, we revisit decentralized approaches with VANETs. Endpoint devices hold a wallet which may incorporate threshold key management methods like MPC wallets, HD Wallets, or multi-party threshold ECDSA/EdDSA/BLS. We also discuss trust management approaches and demonstrate how decentralization can improve integrity, security, privacy, and resilience to single points of failure. We also conduct a comprehensive review, comparing them with current requirements, and the latest authentication and secure communication architectures, which require the involvement of trusted but non-transparent authorities in certificate issuance/revocation. We highlight the limitations of these schemes from PKI deployment and recommend future research, particularly in the realm of quantum cryptography.},

abstract = {In data-intensive workloads, data placement and memory management are inherently difficult: the programmer and the operating system have to choose between (combinations of) DRAM and storage, replacement policies, as well as paging sizes. Efficient memory management is based on fine-grained data access patterns driving placement decisions. Current solutions in this space cannot be applied to general workloads and production systems due to either unrealistic assumptions or prohibitive monitoring overheads.To overcome these issues, we introduce DAOS, an open-source system for general data access-aware memory management. DAOS provides a data access monitoring framework that utilizes practical best-effort trade-offs between overhead and accuracy. The memory management engine of DAOS allows users to implement their access-aware management with no code, just simple configuration schemes. For system administrators, DAOS provides a runtime system that auto-tunes the schemes for user-defined objectives in a finite time. We evaluated DAOS on commercial service production systems as well as state-of-the-art benchmarks. DAOS achieves up to 12\% performance improvement and 91\% memory saving. DAOS is upstreamed and available in the Linux kernel.},

abstract = {Semantic genetic programming is a recent, rapidly growing trend in Genetic Programming (GP) that aims at opening the 'black box' of the evaluation function and make explicit use of more information on program behavior in the search. In the most common scenario of evaluating a GP program on a set of input-output examples (fitness cases), the semantic approach characterizes program with a vector of outputs rather than a single scalar value (fitness). The past research on semantic GP has demonstrated that the additional information obtained in this way facilitates designing more effective search operators. In particular, exploiting the geometric properties of the resulting semantic space leads to search operators with attractive properties, which have provably better theoretical characteristics than conventional GP operators. This in turn leads to dramatic improvements in experimental comparisons.The aim of the tutorial is to give a comprehensive overview of semantic methods in genetic programming, illustrate in an accessible way a formal geometric framework for program semantics to design provably good mutation and crossover operators for traditional GP problem domains, and to analyze rigorously their performance (runtime analysis). A number of real-world applications of this framework will be also presented. Other promising emerging approaches to semantics in GP will be reviewed. In particular, the recent developments in the behavioral programming, which aims at characterizing the entire program behavior (and not only program outputs) will be covered as well. Current challenges and future trends in semantic GP will be identified and discussed.Selected methods and concepts will be accompanied with live software demonstrations. Also, efficient implementation of semantic search operators may be challenging. We will illustrate very efficient, concise and elegant implementations of these operators, which are available for download from the web.},

Soulbound tokens add an important piece to blockchain technology, as they could be the key to building Web3 and a trustworthy decentralized society. Issued and strictly linked to an account, representing the soul of a user, the soulbound token makes it possible to represent a property that only the user can have and that cannot be transferred, but only removed, which enhances security. To evaluate their impact on blockchain development, we first examine the concept of soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their effective adoption. The application sectors include the creation of digital identity certificates, ownership certificates, reputational certificates, governance, and the healthcare sector. We then report and describe relevant blockchain token standards, including soulbound token standards, provided in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Finally, to study the efficacy of the implementation of soulbound tokens, we propose a case study that includes the design and development of a decentralized vaccine certification prototype based on soulbound tokens. In our system, the vaccination data produced by the health authority is fully decentralized and implemented as the issuance of soulbound tokens for the benefit of a citizen's soul account. As a result, the citizen is the only owner of the vaccination data.},

abstract = {Blockchain governance plays a crucial role in projects utilizing blockchain technology, as it defines decision-making and the evolution of the project over time. In this paper, we are particularly interested in liquid democracy governance models which have recently gained attention and which allow to delegate votes. We empirically study existing deployments of these models on Gitcoin and the Internet Computer, and measure the concentration of the voting power. We observe quite a high skew, which contrasts with the otherwise highly decentralized nature of the application. We hope that our preliminary insights can lead to follow-up work in the community and nourish the discussion on the different governance designs.},

However, it is not clear whether voting preferences in the virtual world will mirror real-world voting preferences. We present a within-subject study in which participants were asked to allocate voting power in two scenarios. The first scenario probed participants’ opinion about the divisibility of voting rights. The second scenario presented participants with the case of unequal allocation of voting power in a virtual world, enforced by smart contracts. In both scenarios, participants allocated voting power and rated the fairness of their decision. Our study finds that participants’ voting preferences in the virtual world scenario did not mirror their real-world preferences and beliefs. Voting systems in the metaverse need to be carefully designed to align with human values and ethics.},

abstract = {People are getting familiar with cryptocurrencies because of the rapid development of cryptography, and bitcoin, a traditional decentralized digital currency, becomes famous. Thus, it is necessary to establish a digital currency allocation framework. Two existing methods both share the same goal of reaching blockchain consensus; however, the processes are different: The proof of Work system is completely related to tasks, but the Proof of Stake system is related to tokens. Hence, service providers are more than glad to apply the Proof of Work theory after distinguishing the difference between these two systems; this system which does not have high limitations is more fair and balanced. To enhance the traditional Proof of Work system, Artificial Intelligence can properly help and make the new framework works more efficiently. AI model can pre-assign a trustworthy score via the IP address, and then it can take the responsibility to generate the puzzle for the qualification. After the model verifies the output, the trustworthy score can increase or decrease based on the performance. Finally, it can establish a loop from the trustworthy score to puzzle difficulty, and then back to the trustworthy score. Therefore, an AI assistant can accurately monitor the entire transaction process and ensure validation to be environmentally friendly.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology (BCT) has garnered a great deal of attention and interest due to its cutting-edge, revolutionary, and promising features. The concept of blockchain involves linking a series of transaction blocks together in a chain, with each block being encrypted and inaccessible to anyone who lacks unanimous agreement. BC is comprised of five core stages, but the focus of this paper is on BC 2.0, specifically smart contracts. Smart contracts are utilized to ensure appropriate access controls and the enforcement of contracts. Digital signatures are essential for transactions in smart contracts, and various signature algorithms are employed, including ECDSA and EdDSA. The research problem is to compare and contrast the levels of security offered by two digital signature algorithms, ECDSA and EdDSA, which are employed in smart contracts. The primary objective of this study is to determine which digital signature algorithm performs better in terms of security.},

However, a unified framework to analyze and compare different selection mechanisms is largely missing. To address this gap, we advocate employing concepts and tools from computational social choice to devise a model in which different selection mechanisms can be formalized. Such a model would allow for conceptualizing and evaluating desirable representation axioms. We make the first step in this direction by proposing a unifying mathematical formulation of different selection mechanisms as well as various social-choice-inspired axioms such as proportionality and monotonicity.},

Sixteen participants in the first round of interviews were involved in the framework’s creation. Then we developed and implemented our framework in the community with the help of other stakeholders. This proof-of-concept creates user groups using information from users’ daily activities as input and grows the green plants in a virtual environment. Finally, we involved AI agents and stakeholders in the framework test and iterations. Our study’s user evaluation of a few key stakeholders demonstrates how our strategy enhances user viscosity and experience.

abstract = {Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a carrier of unique identity as a virtual currency. Its indivisible, unique, and verifiable characteristics can truly reflect personal assets and virtual assets to a certain extent. It is widely applied by users in art, games, collectibles and other areas. NFT is stored on the blockchain. The user's digital signature is embedded into the NFT record, which is distributed through a smart contract and verified by the blockchain consensus mechanism, thus solving the problem of identity confirmation in digital asset transactions. This paper makes a review of the main processes and key technologies in NFT applications. First, it introduces the life of NFT: minting, distribution, storage and circulation. Then, the key technologies of NFT are explained, including the blockchain smart contracts and consensus mechanisms in NFT distribution and transaction, the token standards that the minting and transaction process of NFT needs to use, and the important role of NFT in the field of web3. Finally, through the evaluation system of NFT, the problems existing in the current NFT applications and the future research direction are drawn out.},

The value, legitimacy, and utility of NFTs is disputed: proponents highlight revolutionary economic and cultural potentials of an open, secure, and immutable ownership database, while opponents are displeased by the environmental issues and abundant wrongdoing in the ecosystem. Nevertheless, the phenomenon is relevant to HCI, and signifies important developments for future interactive products. To better understand the NFT phenomenon, and to inform future HCI research and design, we investigated the stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem and relations between them. Based on open data we mined from the social news website Hacker News, we contribute the first data-backed model of stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem. The model reveals a nuanced account of the outlooks of creators, owners, and technologists; identifies investment firms and auction houses as arbiters of knowledge and value; and presents implications for future research.},

To address this problem, there has been a great deal of research on algorithmically-efficient deep learning, which seeks to reduce training costs not at the hardware or implementation level, but through changes in the semantics of the training program. In this paper, we present a structured and comprehensive overview of the research in this field. First, we formalize the algorithmic speedup problem, then we use fundamental building blocks of algorithmically efficient training to develop a taxonomy. Our taxonomy highlights commonalities of seemingly disparate methods and reveals current research gaps. Next, we present evaluation best practices to enable comprehensive, fair, and reliable comparisons of speedup techniques. To further aid research and applications, we discuss common bottlenecks in the training pipeline (illustrated via experiments) and offer taxonomic mitigation strategies for them. Finally, we highlight some unsolved research challenges and present promising future directions.},

Non-fungible tokens are a recent example, as they allow a decentralized way to generate and verify proof of ownership via distributed ledger technology. Despite crucial uncertainties, these tokens have generated great enthusiasm for the future of digital property and its surrounding economy. In this regard, I think there is an untapped opportunity in applying a hypertext approach to augment such highly structured ownership-based associations. To this end, in this work I propose hyperownership, based on the premises that property is the law of lists and ledgers, and that hypertext is an apt method to inquiry such a ledger system. In spite of the significant risks and challenges to realize such a vision, I believe that it has great potential to transform the way with which we interact with digital property.},

Therefore, it should be protected, and awareness needs to be created. Today, in the face of climate change challenges and natural disaster, some of our heritages, linked to natural landscapes, is endangered. This paper describes developing an alternative licensing model for NFTs and a mobile-based NFT marketplace created to promote and protect nature as a heritage in the face of climate change-induced dangers. By incorporating evidence about state-of-the-art, leveraging blockchain and NFTs technologies at the service of heritage, here we highlight two essential and unique aspects: i) ensuring the usage of zero-carbon blockchain solutions and the creation of temporary NFTs, and ii) enabling continuous income sources for the asset owners, in our case organisations devoted to the protection of the designated natural landscapes. In this paper, we describe the design process and the validation of the ideas behind the usage and licensing of zero-carbon temporary NFTs. Thus we propose a financially sustainable solution capable of showing the actual state of the lineage (for example, the changing aspect of a landscape over seasons) and promoting a continuous source of donations used to preserve the assets. We validated the concept with users and obtained good usability and design results, proving the chosen approach’s effectiveness.},

abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is considered a new vision of banking and financial services based on Peer-to-Peer technology, and in particular on the blockchain technology. Since 2020, DeFi has started to develop in the cryptocurrency markets. Then, with the increase in popularity of digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and with the launch of the Metaverse, DeFi has been introduced into the Social environment by the combination of social networking and finance in the blockchain. This new shape of DeFi has been called Social Finance (SocialFi). SocialFi can be seen as the social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing to get monetary benefits from being part of SocialFi platforms. In detail, SocialFi has a special feature that is decentralized, open and user-controlled, and it started to be adopted by the communities. The main component of SocialFi is the Social token used to reward people. In this paper, we describe in detail the concept of SocialFi, and we discuss its application on future Social Media platforms.},
