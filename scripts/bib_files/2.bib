abstract = {Our understandings of money, possessions, and ownership are all changing dramatically as consumption becomes digital and virtual. The Metaverse is an imagined future space where these building blocks of neoliberal production and consumption are delinked. We examine these changes through the affordances of cryptocurrencies, algorithmic collectibles, and NFTs. We seek to disambiguate these efforts at disintermediation through online auctions and speculation. We present practical implications for artists, art institutions, buyers, and investors. We theorize new forms of ownership with fractional ownership and fractionalized property rights. And we seek to understand why some consumers pay astronomical prices for digital art that includes simple and often silly artwork with limited property rights. To do so we distinguish alternate, but sometimes overlapping, buyer motivations in the wild world of crypto art as we purportedly move toward the Metaverse.}

The technical solutions proposed in the literature to address this issue remain confined to proof-of-concept implementations within the boundaries of individual nuclear plants. In this work, we aim at answering the following question: How can we design a system to monitor the radioactive waste information along its complete lifecycle across different stakeholders, while making such information also safely available to the public when necessary? The proposed system combines IoT and blockchain technology. IoT sensors placed on nuclear waste drums allow to generate information regarding their status in real time. Blockchain provides an immutable repository for the drum monitoring information decentralized across a set of stakeholders, like nuclear waste originators, waste packaging and transportation companies, storage sites, and regulatory bodies. Following the principles of design science research, we describe a prototype implementation of the proposed system based on a private instance of Ethereum and its application in a pseudo-real use case in Korea. The proposed system is the first of its kind evaluated by practitioners and aims to set a reference for future implementations in this field.}

This article introduces DA2Wa, a protocol designed to establish a secure pairing between a cryptocurrency wallet and a DApp, both of which run as isolated applications on the same machine. The protocol utilizes a six-character PIN exchange mechanism, delivering a security level equivalent to that of Bluetooth. To demonstrate the security of DA2Wa, we employ Tamarin Prover, a tool for symbolically modelling and analysing security protocols.}

However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet. The experimental results show that our scheme can more securely solve the problem of excessive privacy leakage of medical users within a feasible timeframe.}

Blockchain technology supports time-stamping, authentication, process coordination, non-repudiation, commercial transactions, and also provides security for transactions and storage. The pharmaceutical SCM demands accurate, immediate and secure control system. Additionally, the supply chain process data from IoTs is stored and processed in Cloud by Analytics applications, for business planning and improvement. An efficient and secure IoT-Cloud-Blockchain based system for both SCM automation and analytics has been proposed in this work. It leverages a hierarchical IoT, Mist, Edge, Fog, Cloud computing (IMEFC) architecture to enhance Communication-Response-Compute-Security-Storage (CRCSS) in the system. Blockchain technology provides security for the SCM transactions and data. The efficiency of the Blockchain is measured in terms of upload time, download time and transaction fees for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Filecoin platforms. The Filecoin blockchain platform is quicker and cost-effective for larger file sizes, compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin, making it suitable for Pharmaceutical SCM systems.}

The contribution of this paper is the first application of toolkits theory to Web3, reframing its development as a problem of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of distributed information. We provide implications for the role of developers as user innovators, the economic problem of emergent toolkit stacking, and the design of toolkit business models.}

Using Bitcoin as an example, we analyze the data distribution of covert channels within the block and transaction structure. Furthermore, we compare the hiding patterns and covert communication patterns and discuss the challenges and promising directions to achieve secure, robust, and cost-effective covert communication using blockchain.

Blockchain technology drives the emergence of unprecedented types of ventures, with varying degrees of decentralization, both from an infrastructural and organizational perspective. However, there is no consistency regarding the definitions and labels used to refer to blockchain ventures. This paper proposes a definition of blockchain ventures and provides a typology distinguishing four ideal types of blockchain ventures. Our findings reveal that blockchain ventures do not inherently entail either organizational or infrastructural decentralization.

Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms. To effectively leverage decentralized trust as a novel aspect of competitive actions, business leaders must pursue Web3 technologies that are reliable, high-growth market segments that are credible, and ventures that are investable.}

Through this research, we have identified key topics such as investment security or corporate challenges that provide valuable insights and structured information essential for industry stakeholders. In summary, this study explores the dynamic interplay between blockchain technology, ICOs, STOs and social media in the industry. It sheds light on the sentiment and implications of the use of this technology and these emerging financial models, offering a nuanced understanding of their impact on the market. Thus, the idea that user opinions play a crucial role in influencing decisions is supported, and their impact can fluctuate depending on the changing dynamics of the market.}

Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.}

However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain. While solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria. Despite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.}

We explain in detail how GameFi differs from traditional games, and carve out its unique value proposition. We also explore how the mechanics of blockchain games influence the social facet of P2E games, where guilds and clans essentially function as profit-sharing organizations. GameFi leverages disparate elements of the crypto space: tokens, DeFi, and NFTs. Lastly, we discuss in detail some of the challenges of GameFi.}

abstract = {Digital globalization enabled by disruptive technologies has opened a myriad of ways to create value, warranting a cross-disciplinary research agenda on digital connectivity in international business (IB). Given the scarcity of understanding about the role of specific technologies enabling value creation through digital connectivity, we investigate how blockchain-based digital connectivity shapes value creation in international digital platforms and ecosystems (DPEs). Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity. Moreover, this interdisciplinary explanation reveals why certain features theoretically attributed to blockchain (e.g., decentralization, trust) do not always realize or support value creation in practice in IB based on the DPE business model.}

One possibility is to securely store and represent personalized consumer preferences. This manuscript illustrates the application of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a means to present consumer preference data and deliver personalized product recommendations directly to consumers. To do this, we initiated a study involving a small group of 31 respondents who participated in the “What’s Your Whisky” survey. Their responses were transformed into unique pieces of artwork generated by an algorithm. Furthermore, whisky recommendations were derived from these survey responses and integrated into the corresponding artwork. These personalized artworks, which represent each respondent’s whisky taste preference and top whisky selection, can be minted onto a blockchain as NFTs. This process enables respondents to securely own and retain them in their digital wallets, thus creating an immutable record of their whisky taste preferences and personalized recommendations. Finally, a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the value of personalized artwork NFTs. Respondents were asked for preferences between artwork derived from their taste preferences to those with the same whisky recommendations but with randomly sourced background art. Binomial test results revealed a clear preference for artwork based on their personal affirmed that respondents favored artwork based on their personal survey responses.}

Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.}

abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.}

On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.}

In the second phase, we collected and examined code-related data from GitHub and market-related data from blockchain browsers (e.g., Etherscan) for these projects. Our analysis revealed that the Web3 ecosystem can be categorized into two groups, i.e., Web3 infrastructure and Web3 applications, with each consisting of several subcategories or subdomains. We also gained insights into the popularity of these Web3 projects at both the code and market levels and pointed out the challenges in the Web3 ecosystem at the system, developer, and user levels, as well as the opportunities it presents.

abstract = {In the context of extreme societal polarization, activists have mobilized to protest injustices and claim their rights, yet such efforts often fall short of goals because demands normally are directed to government or firms that offer superficial responses. Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.}

abstract = {In modern paradigm of smart grid, prosumers can trade energy peer-to-peer in a transactive energy market to reduce energy costs and improve energy efficiency. In addition, cloud energy storage (CES) is a type of shared energy storage systems with high economic efficiency that can provide energy storage services for prosumers and become an active player in energy trading. However, transactive energy implementation in power systems has several challenges such as data privacy and security. In existing researches, energy trading mechanisms rely on central authorities, where security and privacy cannot be maintained. Therefore, this paper presents a decentralized stochastic optimization model of transactive energy management based on blockchain in the presence of CES. In this framework, the smart contract based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers technique is deployed on the Ganache and Ethereum blockchains, and the YALMIP toolbox along with CPLEX solver handle decentralized optimization in the MATLAB software. The numerical results demonstrate that not only the capacity of distributed generations is fully utilized, but also total costs of smart homes are reduced by more than 27%, and the total grid’s delivery power to smart homes is decreased by more than 24% compared to the inflexible scheduling.}

Thus, in contrast to earlier iterations of the web, Web3 users are asked to trust the technology itself rather than the human intermediaries. On its face, this shift to a trustless web calls into question the traditional conceptions of and requirements for trust. However, in this article, we caution against claims that advocate distrusting Web3 on the basis that, despite how quickly Web3 technology is advancing, the psychological processes through which people perceive and make sense of the social world remain fundamentally unchanged. Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research. Overall, this article provides critical guidance to brand managers, policy advisors, and academics seeking to understand, build, and trust Web3 technology.}

To enhance trading efficiency and pricing fairness, as the major challenges of P2P market designs, this study introduces two new market mechanisms, Hybrid Auction Coalition (HAC), and innovative coalition business model (ICBM), respectively. The performance of these market mechanisms is contrasted with existing mechanisms from the literature with respect to electricity bills, market efficiency, fairness, and blockchain feasibility using a comprehensive list of indicators including costs and profits, fairness, market efficiency, and technical viability. Compared to traditional billing, ICBM and HAC increase sellers’ profit by 88% and 66% respectively, while both impose 13% more costs on buyers. ICBM and HAC also set the fairest prices compared to the existing markets. ICBM is shown to improve blockchain feasibility and market efficiency due to lighter on-chain calculations, and absolute clearing mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that HAC outperforms standalone auctions in every aspect which endorses the hybridization benefits.}

However, existing MCS systems operate in a centralized manner, giving rise to several challenges, including privacy, security, incentives, and dependence on a central service provider. Blockchain is a novel application paradigm that incorporates point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, intelligent contracts, distributed data storage, and other computing technologies, creating a shift from the current centralized paradigm to a decentralized paradigm. Nonetheless, the convergence of MCS and blockchains necessitates addressing numerous fundamental challenges arising from their merger. This paper examines the major issues facing MCS systems and blockchain’s potential role in addressing them. We present the MCS-blockchain integrated deployment strategies, architectural designs, and core blockchain technology principles that contribute significantly to the performance of blockchain-based MCS applications. Additionally, the advancement of blockchain technology and its impact on MCS system security and performance requirements are investigated. Finally, we highlight current research gaps and future research opportunities that may inspire the deployment of novel blockchain-based MCS systems.}

We develop a conceptual model and testable propositions that extend the work of McKnight et al. (2001, 2002, 2011) to the blockchain ecosystem based on an integrative literature review. We conceptualize trust as a multidimensional, multi-object construct combining three major objects of trust: algorithmic trust in the blockchain protocol (platform), trust towards peers and services providers, and trust in decentralized applications (product). The model reflects the process of building a trust layer for users and institutions on top of the trustless technology. The paper demystifies the trust building process, from initial trust to knowledge-based trust, and its dimensions within the blockchain ecosystem, and, consequently, helps practitioners to build strategies that increase users' trust. The contribution to the academic literature resides in the unification of multiple perspectives on trust within an integrative conceptual framework to point out the mechanisms of trust building process, as well as to identify future research directions.}

However, one of its shortcomings is the lack of a defense mechanism against the ability of a single user to generate a surplus of identities, known as the Sybil attack. Web3 has a Sybil attack problem because it uses peer sampling to establish connections between users. We evaluate the promising but under-explored direction of Sybil avoidance using network latency measurements, according to which two identities with equal latencies are suspected to be operated from the same node, and thus are likely Sybils. Network latency measurements have two desirable properties: they are only malleable by attackers by adding latency, and they do not require any trust between network participants. Our basic SybilSys mechanism avoids Sybil attackers using only network latency measurements if attackers do not actively exploit their malleability. We present an enhanced version of SybilSys that protects against targeted attacks using a variant of the flow correlation attack, which we name TrafficJamTrigger. We show how the message flows of Round-Trip Time measurements can be used to expose attack patterns and we propose and evaluate six classifiers to recognize these patterns. Our experiments show, through both emulation and real-world deployment, that enhanced SybilSys can serve a fundamental role for Web3, effectively establishing connections to real users even in the face of networks consisting of 99% Sybils.}

However, DFL faces incentive and security challenges in the decentralized framework. To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.}

These issues are often perpetuated by centralized systems and their manipulation by system administrators. Furthermore, the lack of data ownership and the monetization of user data by tech companies further increase concerns about transparency. In light of these concerns, this study aims to review existing blockchain-based governance models and identify best-practice governance models focusing on corruption transparency, their characteristics, and components. The research will also examine the role of a token economy in addressing trusted third-party issues related to asset ownership management. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of smart contracts, blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Web 3.0, and multifactor challenge set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFSSIA) as modern technologies to combat corruption and achieve transparency in the public sector. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) comprising peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters published between 2012 and 2023. Using the SLR methodology, 45 primary and supporting studies have been selected for result extraction and analysis. Finally, we discovered seven blockchain-based governance models with their characteristics and primary components.}

There is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that integrates Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, and advanced cryptographic techniques to address these challenges and enhance the security and transparency of transactions. This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions. This work highlights the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized protocols in revolutionizing security and transparency across diverse sectors.}

Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices.

The amount of transactions generated and stored in such Web3 applications is significant and, in its raw form, usually not searchable by users. Existing Web3 transaction indexing and search engines are predominantly centralized and, therefore, can manipulate search results or censor particular queries. With the proliferation of Web3 transactions and applications, a decentralized and censorship-resistant search primitive is becoming essential. We present DeScan, a decentralized and censorship-resistant indexing and search engine for Web3. Users index their local Web3 transactions using custom rules that output triplets. Generated triplets are bundled in a distributed transaction graph that is searchable by other users. To coordinate search and distribute the storage of the transaction graph over peers in the network, we build upon a Skip Graph (SG) data structure. Since the Skip Graph does not provide any resilience against adversarial peers that censor searches, we propose four modifications to improve its robustness. We implement DeScan and conduct experiments with up to 12 800 peers and 10 million Ethereum transactions. Our experiments show that DeScan with our modifications enabled can tolerate 20% adversarial peers and 35% unresponsive peers without disruption. Moreover, we find that searches in DeScan are usually completed well within a second, even when the network grows. Finally, we show that storage and network costs are evenly distributed amongst peers as the network grows.}
