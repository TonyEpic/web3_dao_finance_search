  abstract={The advent of Web3 technologies and blockchain has opened new avenues for exploring decentralized solutions to pressing environmental issues. A blockchain-based Web3 application for the management of CO2 absorption rights could be a very effective solution to combat climate change. Blockchain technology allows the creation of permanent and transparent records of transactions in a decentralized network, which makes it an ideal tool for monitoring and managing CO2 absorption rights. The rights could be registered in the blockchain and transferred through smart contracts, which would guarantee the validity and traceability of these transactions. In addition, the Web3 application would allow greater accessibility for users, since it could be accessed from anywhere without the need to have proprietary systems installed. Decentralized applications could also be used to verify CO2 emissions and removals by users, which would increase transparency and trust in the system. This paper presents the development of a novel Web3 application that leverages blockchain technology for managing CO2 absorption rights using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The proposed application allows for the secure, transparent, and efficient management of CO2 absorption rights, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of carbon offsetting initiatives.},

  abstract={Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is an emerging computation architecture, which provides high scalability and flexibility. All the existing F aaS systems are owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. While this is not an issue for most existing enterprise applications, such character is not compatible with the decentralization principle of dApp/Web3 applications, more of which are being deployed in the cloud environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a decentralized FaaS, which is managed by multiple cloud service providers and allows a decentralized application to take advantages of FaaS. In this research paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system for managing decentralized FaaS using blockchain technology and decentralized API management, where functions are executed on a distributed network of nodes by multi-cloud data centers, rather than on a centralized server. This allows for greater scalability and flexibility, as well as improved security and reliability.},

  abstract={Initiatives such as blockchains and decentralized storage networks are pushing for a decentralized Web3 to replace the current architecture. At the core of Web3 are network resource sharing services, which allow anyone to sell spare network capacity in return for rewards. These services require a way to establish trust, as parties are potentially malicious. This can be achieved by reputation systems. In this paper we make the case for using deep reinforcement learning in Web3 reputation calculation. More specifically, we propose a model which allows for decentralized calculation of scores with high personalization for the user.},

  abstract={This paper presents a proof-of-concept (PoC) that leverages Web3 technology, specifically blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), to create a secure, transparent, and fair reseller market without the need for a trusted third party. The PoC demonstrates that NFTs can be used to authenticate items, build trust between parties and establish verifiable product own-ership. By paralleling NFT transfers with the sale of items, the practicality of selling counterfeit goods is reduced. Furthermore, the blockchain-based storage of product information enables verification of origin, history, and authenticity by any involved party, fostering transparency and equal access to information for buyers and sellers. We demonstrate that Web3 technology can effectively address critical issues in traditional reseller markets, offering substantial benefits to all parties involved.},

  abstract={Technology has advanced and with it, cybercrime has become a reality. The rise of Web3 technology aims to decentralize the internet and create a trustless network of smart contracts, leading to the limitation of conventional identification systems. Blockchain technology provides a solution to security concerns by instilling trust in end-users' minds. In this project, a blockchain-based identification system will be created using SoulBound Tokens. These NFT-like tokens cannot be transferred after minting, making them immutable and secure. Third parties can request users' credentials, which can be easily verified through the blockchain's transparent chain of custody. This approach creates a secure and reliable identification system that protects users' data and assets from malicious actors. This concept extends to finance, healthcare, and government services. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can create a more secure environment for individuals and institutions.},

  abstract={Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable, peer-to-peer network which provides trust, transparency, and tamper resistance and these features have led to various applications such as bitcoin and ethereum. Various structures of Blockchains are designed in fields such as e-health as it can facilitate safe and secure storage of the patient’s information in the health care system. Data integration problem in healthcare can be overcome by bringing a decentralized system in the hospital organization. This paper focuses on the use of Blockchains in managing medical records for insurance claim. By removing the central administrator, the suggested architecture uses Ethereum smart contracts to create a tamperproof and transparent healthcare system and ensure the integrity of sensitive patient data. Additionally, the smart contract keeps the patient well-informed and governs the communication between all the participants in the network. The proposed approach provides a solution to eliminate fraudulent insurance claims using Machine Learning (ML) with Blockchain.

Mutual monitoring of medical information on the blockchain creates a mutually supportive relationship where users themselves monitor each other. In this demonstration experiment, the system was introduced to six elderly people. This decentralized system in which users themselves monitor each other is called the Web3 type. The Web type is a technology that is expected to break through the current concentration of data in overseas digital industries and leave digital data resources in Japan. This research is unique in that it combines blockchain technology, which is at the core of this technology, with medical information.

  abstract={An all-encompassing and flexible framework that links theoretical principles and actual execution is required for the creation of hardware for Web3.0 and edge intelligence. Decentralized identification, semantic data, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs are just few of the concepts that are examined in depth to provide the groundwork for this technique. The main goal is to figure out what kinds of hardware are needed to implement these theoretical principles. Subsequently, the technique continues to extract the hardware requirements, distinguishing the unique demands, problems, and performance criteria important for enabling Web3.0 and edge intelligence. These needs include a wide range of topics, including performance, safety, efficiency, scalability, and even compatibility. Once the theoretical principles and hardware requirements are fully understood, the technique moves on to the design step. Key to realizing these abstract ideas is the development of specialized hardware architectures and components. Based on the outcomes of the performance assessment, iterative refinement is carried out to fix the hardware's flaws and enhance its functionality. As a result of this iterative process, hardware is kept up to date to suit the ever-shifting requirements of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. The suggested technique concludes with an emphasis on flexibility and future-proofing in light of the everchanging nature of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. Keeping up with technology developments and reevaluating the hardware design as needed are both part of this process.},

  abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have become a prevalent part of everyday life, making the need for IoT firmware security greater than ever. Firmware dispatch systems play a crucial role in maintaining the secure operations of IoT devices, where a compromise on the integrity of dispatches may simply ruin an IoT device. Hence it is essential to have robust solutions to safeguard such systems. With the advent of blockchain and Web3 technologies, there are new options for tackling security-related challenges. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof, secure, and fully distributed protocol, making it an excellent choice for a firmware dispatch system. In this work, we explore the existing blockchain-based solutions for distributing IoT firmware updates, and then propose a secure firmware dispatch system for IoT devices using Ethereum. Our system employs Web3.Storage, with a hosted implementation of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol. In the evaluation, we demonstrate that our designed architecture is fast, reliable, and scalable by offering a firmware integrity validation. It can benefit a wide range of manufacturers who intend to increase the security of their IoT devices.},

  pages={151-154},
  abstract={Blockchain is a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that is an emerging technology currently disrupting various fields. The aim of this paper is to explore ways to harness the advantages of blockchain while being implemented to existing systems. A permissioned blockchain can be established through Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) that utilizes ledgers that are interacted upon by a chaincode. An HLF network was established to investigate the custom chaincode. The scenario of the project was grounded on the functions performed in a web-based property inventory management system that uses a centralized database. The chaincode in the project was written using JavaScript and Node.js was used to create the whole chaincode source. A channel was built between the nodes of the blockchain where the chaincode was deployed. Subsequently, to open a gateway to the network, multiple Representational State Transfer (RST) Application Programming Interface (API) were created. Several gateway endpoints were tested through Insomnia, a cross-platform API client for RST. The tests performed employed various request methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) which resulted in evidence that the custom chaincode is fully functional and adheres to the OpenAPI specification. The paper concludes that it is highly feasible and advantageous to integrate a blockchain into an existing Web 2.0 system. Most functions and business logic in existing traditional systems can be reflected in a chaincode with proper planning and execution. In the future, other aspects of the blockchain network will be explored further.},

  abstract={The advancements of the metaverse has validated a new world of possibilities with Web2 and Web3 technologies that are increasingly immersive, interconnected, spatial and decentralized. One of the key Web3 technologies that is intersecting with the metaverse is blockchain technology, that has now imbued metaverse worlds and platform as what are now identified as Layer-1 and Layer-2 metaverse, and in tandem the intersecting of decentralized Web3 technologies including but not limited to metaverse currencies and cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens and tokenization, marketplaces, digital wallets, and blockchain main and side-chain networks. In combination with interoperable and interconnected avatars, the metaverse is evolving beyond phygital experiences and asset architecting into financial experiences and asset trading. This research paper investigates the intersections between the metaverse and Web3 emerging technologies by firstly conducting a systematic literature review of the metaverse and its intersection with emerging technologies which currently has a dearth in academic and research literature despite the developments of the Web3 metaverse and its Layer-1 Layer-2 protocol. The review is followed by pilot-testing the metaverse platforms intersecting with Web3 technologies in real-world, particularly on the use of buy-and-sell, trading and item ownership under decentralized finance and financial technology. Finally, the research assesses the resulting metaverse based on user reviews and experiences on the feasibility of Web3 metaverse. The intersection of Web3 and the metaverse is still an early adoption of IR4.0 emerging technologies, yet the convergence of the metaverse, blockchain technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence is ultimately the precursor to the future Web4.},

  pages={3342-3356},
  abstract={The use of IoT technology in collecting personal health records (PHR) within the eHealth environment is a growing trend. However, data integrity is a concern as cloud service providers (CSPs) often cannot guarantee it. Blockchain technology offers a solution to guarantee data integrity and traceability. However, the immutability of traditional blockchain conflicts with GDPR's requirements. To address scalability and privacy concerns, we have designed a comprehensive scheme that integrates the redactable blockchain with the existing revocable IPFS mechanism. Our scheme overcomes the disadvantage of residual downloading information in the traditional blockchain. Additionally, we have developed an enhanced proxy re-encryption scheme that simplifies access control for physicians without the need for complex group key management. Unlike traditional blockchains and P2P file sharing systems, our PHR platform allows for selective removal of records and files while maintaining auditable logs. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively enhances the exclusive revocation feature with acceptable overheads. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide the merit of fully complete record and file revocation on a blockchain-based system.},

  abstract={In the evolution of technology, the Web 3.0 has become the future of the technological world. The web 3.0, which is still evolving, aims in creating an immersive environment which contains smart applications supported by AI and aims in decentralization of data. In the upcoming era, the successor of today’s transactions is most likely to be the transactions through cryptocurrency, which is built on top of the blockchain technology. It is important to make the upcoming technology more reliable, secure, and fast to bring it to real-time use. To overcome the low throughput and high latency of broadcasting in blockchain technology this paper comes up with the pandemic protocol for broadcasting. Communication can be the most important part of any network to work efficiently. It is a communication protocol used for broadcasting which works on the principle of how the pandemic Covid-19 spread. The implementation of this protocol in the blockchain technology to broadcast the transactions can make the technology more efficient and faster. This implementation will be tested for its efficiency and its throughput, analyze its performance, and resolve issues. Overall, this work will help in remove the inadequacies of existing communication protocols thus helping in demonstrating the benefits of this pandemic protocol for communication. The Pandemic Protocol minimizes data redundancy, reducing latency and network congestion, a significant improvement over traditional protocol. In the Web 3.0 era, the Pandemic Protocol’s efficient communication capabilities make it ideal for real-time applications and network scalability. By minimizing redundant data, it bolsters security, reducing the risk of data tampering and strengthening data integrity. Unlike energy-intensive protocols like Proof of Work (PoW), the Pandemic Protocol minimizes resource consumption, making it eco-friendly and cost-effective.},

  abstract={${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, often cited to drastically shape our lives, is ubiquitous. However, few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0. Our definition is not the only way of understanding ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, in this article, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: ${\mathsf (i)}$(i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and ${\mathsf (ii)}$(ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService in approximately 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability and scalability.},

  abstract={Websites and Web apps have become increasingly crucial over the past decade to daily life. Over the last ten years, websites have increased from three million to over 1.7 billion. Modern centralised digital marketplaces and enterprises provide consumers with an alternative method of selling and purchasing items conveniently. However, disadvantages among the marketplaces include the platform’s potential to arbitrarily block merchants, the fees associated with listing and selling products on the site, and the lack of user data privacy. In this, we propose and demonstrate a decentralised application that takes advantage of the Ethereum blockchain to address all these issues. The Truffle development framework was employed in the creation of the application. An Ethereum smart contract later migrated to the Ethereum network comprised the application’s features. The web3.js API (Application Program Interface) was used to send the user’s input to the Ethereum network after being received through a web interface. The users involved will be able to do transactions with the help of an interactive user interface. The interfacing is done using the Truffle framework, and the transactions are made through MetaMask, where ETH tokens are used. The dApp is created using JavaScript and React JS library. Thus, the integration of the blockchain and with front-end application by interfacing it with web 3.0 helps create a secured, immutable, trusted, and easy-to-use e-commerce website.},

  abstract={Individual medical records have a high priority of integrity and security, yet they are vulnerable to data breaches and manipulation. It’s vital to communicate these data in a secure and safe manner. To overcome this problem, the proposed solution named, CoreMedi, uses blockchain technology to store and share medical data. Data stored on blockchain is immutable, verifiable and transparent (based on accessibility). As data cannot be altered on blockchain, the rate of fraud may be drastically decreased. With the help of smart contracts which are small pieces of code that run on blockchain, a Decentralized Application (DApps) is designed and implemented that enables patients/individuals to store and share medical records securely. Users may share their medical history, medications, and personal data with a specific medical personnel on the same blockchain network using CoreMedi, a Decentralized Web application. The application is implemented with React as frontend and the backend infrastructure uses Ethereum solidity smart contracts. The process of running a blockchain application is not simple because the users must be willing to spend crytpocurrencies as gas fees, as this is the way to maintain the network with no single organization having control.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of web technology, Web3.0 has attracted a considerable amount of attention due to its unique decentralized characteristics. The digital economy is an important driver of high-quality economic development and is currently in a rapid development stage. In the digital economy scenario, the centralized nature of the Internet and other characteristics usually bring about security issues such as infringement and privacy leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how to use Web3.0 technologies to solve the pain points encountered in the development of the digital economy by fully exploring the critical technologies of digital economy and Web3.0. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of Web3.0 that should be integrated with the digital economy to better find the entry point to solve the problems by examining the latest advances of Web3.0 in machine learning, finance, and data management. We hope this research will inspire those who are involved in both academia and industry, and finally help to build a favourable ecology for the digital economy.},

  abstract={The frequency of software supply chain attacks has reached unprecedented levels, primarily due to the increasing reliance on huge numbers of software and hardware dependencies, and the inherent vulnerabilities they harbor. Currently, vendors providing these software and hardware components share security advisories to centralized databases or post them on proprietary websites, which security engineers have to search manually to find vulnerabilities relevant for their systems. Furthermore, the security advisories often do not follow a standard machine-readable format, which results in the engineers having to manually analyze the documents. In this paper, SENTINEL, a novel solution for automating dissemination and discovery of security advisories leveraging Web3 technologies, is presented. In particular, the Ethereum blockchain is used by vendors to notify asset owners of novel vulnerabilities in their systems in a reliable and accountable manner. Evaluation tests conducted on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet confirm that our proposal is a functional and functioning solution for securely disseminating and discovering security advisories utilizing a fully decentralized infrastructure. SENTINEL’s source code is released as open source software on GitHub.},

  abstract={Web3 brings an emerging outlook for the value of decentralization, boosting the decentralized infrastructure. People can benefit from Web3, facilitated by the advances in distributed ledger technology, to read, write and own web content, services and applications more freely without revealing their real identities. Although the features and merits of Web3 have been widely discussed, the network architecture of Web3 and how to achieve complete decentralization considering law compliance in Web3 are still unclear. Here, we propose a perspective of Web3 architecture, deController, consisting of underlay and overlay network as Web3 infrastructures to underpin services and applications. The functions of underlay and overlay and their interactions are illustrated. Meanwhile, the security and privacy of Web3 are analyzed based on a novel design of three-tier identities cooperating with deController. Furthermore, the impacts of laws on privacy and cyber sovereignty to achieve Web3 are discussed.},

  abstract={Web3 has received a lot of attention since its emergence. It aims to provide users with more diverse and vivid web services as well as the complete control over their own data. To support the development of Web3, privacy-preserving decentralized data computing schemes need to be studied. In earlier works, blockchain was used for trusted data sharing. However, due to the lack of computing attribute, blockchain is not capable enough to ensure the trustworthiness of the distributed computing process. Besides, the distributed computing method requires a large amount of data transmission and the current privacy protection researches seldom consider the problem of user privacy. In this article, we design a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving distributed data computing architecture to break-through the limitations of existing researches. The proposed architecture ensures the secure and trustworthy computing with state channel and computing sandbox. We also design a sandbox location obfuscation method based on onion routing technology, making it difficult for attackers to identify the sandbox location or infer user privacy. Our solution fully considers the characteristics of Web3 and can well support the diverse Web3 applications.},

We propose AFFIRM, a secure privacy-preserving blockchain framework for efficient, scalable and lightweight mobility data generation, validation, storage and retrieval in future Web3 applications. AFFIRM enables nearby devices to self-organize as a fog network and collaboratively train machine learning algorithms locally to securely generate, validate, store and retrieve mobility data via consensus leveraging Information Centric Networking as the underlying architecture. The proposed collaborative learning enables nodes to learn and adapt with respect to parameters related to scalability, timeliness, security, privacy, and resource consumption. We evaluate AFFIRM using mobility data from New York city and results shows it to scalably store mobility data from up to 700 devices with lower delays and overhead.},

  abstract={Reputation is a fundamental concept in human social interactions and inter-relationship. Blockchain and Web3 have been rapidly growing, involving multi-millions of users, billions of transactions, and hundreds of millions of addresses onchain (i.e. on-blockchain). Decentralized identity and onchain reputation will play a critical role in defining each individual's persona, and natively supporting onchain entities to build trust in the Web3 space, while preserving user privacy and autonomy. This paper presents a novel reputation ranking method to address the problem. We leverage adaptive weighted Page Rank algorithms to assess and rank the reputation of participants within various public blockchains. We assign reputation scores to onchain entities based on their historical transaction behaviors, taking transaction volume, activeness, and network contributions into account. In addition to describing the theoretical framework of our reputation ranking, this paper provides empirical insights into its implementation on transactional datasets of Ethereum and BNB Chain. The results and findings presented herein offer a foundation for further research and development of onchain reputation systems in public blockchains and its applications in decentralized finance and Web3 ecosystems.},

  abstract={The development of effective recommender systems for Web3 assets, such as the Non-Fungible Token (NFT), requires concentration along with the growth of popularity and heterogeneity in many potential applications such as Web3 gaming and NFT rental markets, the requirements of predicting rNFT classification desire a practical solution. In this paper, we make use of the referable NFT (rNFT11In this work, rNFT mainly refers to the EIP-5521 protocol and corresponding formed network/topology [1], while NFT is used in the context of a single node, node sets, or products that align with the EIP-5521 protocol.) standard [2], indexed EIP-5521, to construct an rNFT classification framework leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN), an emerging branch of Deep Learning (DL), which learns on the inherent topology of graph-based data. In particular, we first transform the rNFT backward and onward reference relationship to a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and model appropriate node and edge features from rNFT metadata and associated token transactions. Next, a multi-layer GraphSage model is designed to include the collected features for the learning process. In this way, the model takes into account graph topology together with features to classify both the existing and incoming NFT nodes in a supervised way. We also give comprehensive elaboration on the architecture of the new GNN-based recommender system with discussions in regard to its characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, we expect to conduct extensive experiments, by presenting an initial plan, to show the feasibility and efficacy of our system.},

This first stage of the investigation involves a comprehensive review of previous research, methods, and best practices in the field, with the goal of identifying areas where the envisioned synergy may fill a need. Empirical data culled from preexisting Web3.0 infrastructure, real-world use cases, and simulated data are all considered throughout the data collection process. Expert interviews and surveys are also used to collect qualitative information, with the goal of eliciting relevant feedback from specialists in the area. The research approach itself includes the design and execution of a series of experiments and simulations. These exploratory projects are meant to analyze how Web3.0 apps may best make use of decentralized protocols and edge intelligence. These factors comprise measurements relating to latency, throughput, data availability, scalability, and security/privacy. At the end of the study, a comparison is made between the suggested integrated solution and the status quo of centralized systems and other popular approaches to Web3.0 infrastructure.

  abstract={Online merchandising plays an important role in internet users’ behavior. With the advent of Web3.0 and blockchain technologies, online markets can be adapted to these new changes. In traditional online markets, buying and selling are performed in a centralized manner, which, in addition to the problems of centralized systems, also brings the challenge of users’ trust. One of the challenges in online markets is maintaining the privacy and not revealing the exchanged file to unauthorized entities. Another challenge is to have a mechanism to detect fraud in the market. If the wrong file or key is sent by the seller, the fraud detection mechanism guaranties that the smart contract will be informed and the buyer will be refunded. On the other hand, the seller will be paid if a correct file and its corresponding key have been sent.Blockchain network is not suitable for file storing. Therefore, there are centralized or decentralized methods to store files in building a blockchain based file sharing market. In this work, we selected a distributed file system storage called IPFS (InterPlanetary File system). We integrated IPFS network with a suitable smart contract which is deployed on Ethereum blockchain. We provided a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any dispute that happens between market users.},

  abstract={Electronic First Information Report (e-FIR) is a basic document filed to the police stations by a victim or someone on his/her behalf when a cognizable offense such as murder, kidnapping, rape, theft, etc. is committed. In the e-FIR database, the offense's record can be compromised due to its centralized nature, and further the intentional registration of false e-FIR can occur. Thus, data integrity and transparency are key concerns in e-FIR database. In this paper, e-FIR data integrity and false registration appended with police stations in a centralized database are addressed via a consensus-based distributed blockchain solution, as an integral part of a smart city environment. Specifically, a smart contract based intelligent framework has been utilized to explore the potential of Ethereum blockchain in providing integrity to e-FIR data stored in a police station's database. Local database is interfaced with Ethereum blockchain using Web3 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol. Multiple simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Our results show a trade-off between different hashing algorithm security level for the offenses data and number of transactions stored in a single block on blockchain ledger.},

  abstract={The internet has evolved a lot in the last 40 years and its early applications has become unrecognizable. Web 1.0 focused on serving static pages is considered as the read-only web, whereas web 2.0 made way for dynamic pages making it as read-write web, which is predominantly experienced. The main problem face here is, as the users of E-commerce applications, is single-point-of-failure (SPOF), which means, the data stored in centralized servers is highly susceptible and vulnerable to attacks. Now, the internet's next evolution enables to develop decentralized applications and adds few other features like trustlessness, distributed, transparent, robust, etc. This also makes web 3.0 as read-write-own web. Now, this evolution wave of decentralization has hit the applications. To overcome this problem, this study has proposed a solution to completely decentralize the E-Commerce platform by using Blockchain in conjunction with smart contracts and utilizes the decentralized storage like IPFS (Inter Planetary File System). This article has developed a system that uses ReactJs as the frontend and the Ethereum blockchain as the backend to execute smart contracts using the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and to store data in a decentralized way by using IPFS and BigChainDb.},

  abstract={The typical method of keeping track of medical records uses paper and centralised systems, which introduces a great deal of uncertainty and can lead to inaccurate information, identity theft, a lack of accessibility, and other problems. With the use of blockchain technology, which offers us security, availability, and integrity, this study seeks to address these problems. Using this, the records can be safeguarded and accessible from anywhere, at any time. This blockchain-based solution can protect a patient's life in an emergency since all of the records can be viewed in one location without the inconvenience of running various tests. Re-chain a secure blockchain-based digital medical health record management system was developed to solve the problems with the centralized and traditional system. It is based on the Ethereum network and uses web3.storage which is an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) system to store files in a decentralized manner.},

  abstract={Web3 is a revolutionary Internet paradigm that focusing decentralization, user empowerment, and intelligence. One of its key technologies is decentralized identity (DID), which has gained significant attention recently. However, existing DID solutions are not scalable enough to be compatible with the large-scale identity node applications required by Web3 across various fields. To overcome this challenge, we propose the first multi-layer Web3 DID architecture utilizing sharding blockchain, which provides management, scalability, and compatibility. This architecture leverages leader shards and the main chain to establish trust, while regular shards manage DID-related transactions. Specific system processes and query optimizations are also given. Besides, formal security analysis and comprehensive simulation evaluations have demonstrated that the architecture can achieve all proposed security and performance goals, including low latency of down to 2 seconds and high throughput of up to 90KTPS.},

  abstract={The pharmaceutical industry's crucial task is to look after the medicines while they are being transported, by ensuring ideal storage conditions and keeping track of the complete medications sent to prevent risky scenarios. These three classifications are used by WHO: falsified, substandard, and unregistered/unlicensed. The need for sophisticated tools to identify fabricated pharmaceuticals will rise as criminals grow craftier. To identify phoney and substandard drugs, new technologies are continually being developed. A substantial lack of transparency in the current system makes it difficult for patients to understand the cost of acquired medications, making counterfeit drugs a prime issue. Moreover, if there are accusations of illegal or unethical behaviours, it could be difficult to look into supply chain tampering. The blockchain technology was employed. Two parties' transactions can be efficiently and permanently recorded using an open, distributed ledger like blockchain. Blockchains are transparent, decentralized, distributed, and unchangeable, which makes them an ideal solution for the problem of fake medications. This study proposes a mechanism for the safe distribution of medications throughout the whole supply chain. Each product in the chain can be moved between chain associates who have been confirmed using an event request-response approach. A product may be traced back to its source thanks to smart contracts, which are used to record all transactions between entities onto the blockchain. A DApp is made using the React Framework. On a local blockchain that Ganache provided, the smart contracts were put into action. The blockchain connection between the DApp and Web3.js is made possible by the Truffle framework. The outcomes of the studies show that our method is practical and marginally more secure than existing solutions.},

Blockchain technology, specifically leveraging the Ethereum network, emerges as a promising solution. By utilizing blockchain's traceability features, we can meticulously monitor the origins of food ingredients, tracing their journey from farm to plate. This system, recorded on a decentralized database through smart contracts, ensures an unalterable record of the entire process, providing accessible information about harvesting dates and consumable shelf life. Beyond enhancing traceability and evaluating food quality, the blockchain-based system introduces incentive programs. Participants in the supply chain are motivated through blockchain-linked rewards or tokens, fostering transparency and security in hotel and restaurant food supply chains. This alignment of incentives promotes accountability and active engagement from all stakeholders, ensuring a secure and transparent food supply chain.},

  abstract={Different from “read” based Web1 and “read-write” based Web2, “read-write-own” based Web3 is proposed as a typical user-centric Internet to open the new generation of the World Wide Web. Web3 is the internet religious fundamentalism for data rights owned by users based on identity, data, network, and service, which requires the support of full-process data protection provided by a zero-trust and zero-touch environment. However, as to the traditional layered architecture like TCP/IP, data protection is an overlaid function, which is far away from the full-process data protection requirements. To this end, in order to build a zero-trust and zero-touch environment, a Web3 architecture is presented in this article as a promising paradigm. Meanwhile, the key principles for Web3 architecture designing are discussed, covering interoperability and interpretability of data, trustworthiness throughout network lifecycle, incentive for collaboration and sharing, and human-centric experience. Moreover, in order to achieve these principles, four aspects of enabling technologies are presented, including semantic, incentive, decentralized, and spatial technologies. Finally, some main challenges and open issues are also identified as a future direction for further work.},

  abstract={The music industry has experienced significant growth, primarily driven by digital streaming services. However, major platforms have centralized control, limiting artists’ autonomy and revenue. To address this, the emergence of Music NFT marketplaces represents a revolutionary shift. These platforms leverage blockchain to tokenize music, turning it into unique, tradable assets through NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This allows artists to have direct interactions with fans, offer exclusive content, and establish new revenue streams. Music NFTs serve as certificates of ownership, providing proof of authenticity and making forgery challenging. Artists can choose platforms, mint and sell NFTs, and promote drops on preferred social media. Buyers acquire the original audio file and the chance to support artists. NFT owners can store collections in crypto wallets and decide to sell, with artists earning a share of subsequent sales. Music NFTs offer an alternative to streaming, providing fans a direct means to support artists, while artists strengthen connections with supporters and earn royalties from secondary sales.},

  abstract={Web3.0 apps, with their emphasis on decentralization, real-time processing, and low latency, hold the key to MEC's bright future. This calls for an all-encompassing, future-oriented strategy in MEC architecture and design. The suggested technique is a multi-stage strategy for molding the future of MEC via cutting-edge architectures and designs for Web3.0 over 5G/6G networks. In the first stage, you'll examine the needs and goals of Web3.0 in detail. Real-time, lowlatency interactions are essential, as is familiarity with the dynamics of distributed apps and blockchain technology. In the second stage, we examine the current MEC setup, from edge server dispersion to data center density to network topology. The technique takes use of the low latency, high throughput, and huge device connection offered by 5G and impending 6G networks to guarantee preparedness for the future. The suggested technique is based on novel building layouts as its foundation. Latency, throughput, resource usage, scalability, and security compliance are only few of the metrics that may be evaluated to guarantee that the design is effective. The difficulties of actual deployment are also discussed; they include issues like where to put edge servers and how to scale resources according to demand. To ensure that the process remains in step with developing technologies and user preferences, it is recommended that improvements be made in a series of iterations.},

  abstract={Online Social Networks gained a crucial role in people's everyday life, acting as the medium through which people can interact with each other. The introduction of blockchain technology prompted a new generation of social media based on the concept of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and other Web3 technologies, giving birth to the Metaverse. Decentraland is one such platform, where users can explore a 3D virtual world and communicate with each other. The main feature of Decentraland is that the virtual world is divided into parcels, implemented through NFTs, that can be traded among users and where owners can create buildings or mini-games for other users to play with. In this work, we explore the virtual world of Decentraland by presenting the main details of the virtual world and by focusing on the economic impact of NFT trading on the description of the parcels. In detail, the parcel's description can be used to advertise the proximity of the parcel to infrastructures or special projects to attract potential buyers. This paper's findings show the impact and the magnitude of this phenomenon, highlighting entire quarters that adopt this technique throughout the map by overriding the playful aspect of the platform.},

  abstract={Human lives now include a significant amount of social media usage. Social media is used to create communities, strengthen bonds, and stay in touch with distant friends. A single server, which performs all significant processing, serves as the hub of a centralized system. Thus, a centralized server becomes an easy target for hackers. Decentralized social networks can provide a more secure environment where users may exercise more privacy control through distribution of information processing across many machines. This study proposes a system where the Web3 Library is used to implement the decentralized network. This provides a social graph with all devices in the network. The Ethers library provides functionalities to engage the Ethereum framework. This way an OSN (Online Social Network) service based on blockchain is created and its decentralized operations are performed. Due to a decentralized autonomous organization that is designed for user autonomy, users can democratically self-manage the OSN.},

  abstract={Decentralization promises to remedy the drawbacks of the web by executing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchains. Unfortunately, modern blockchains cannot support realistic web application workloads mainly due to congestion.We introduce the Smart Redbelly Blockchain (SRBB), a provably correct permissionless blockchain that reduces congestion by (1) avoiding redundant propagation and validations of transactions with Transaction Validation and Propagation Reduction (TVPR) and (2) mitigating the propagation of invalid transactions within blocks by Byzantine nodes with a dedicated Reward-Penalty Mechanism (RPM). Our comparison of SRBB against Algorand, Avalanche, Diem, Ethereum, Quorum, and Solana, using the DIABLO benchmark suite, indicates that SRBB outperforms all these blockchains under real application workloads. Moreover, SRBB is the only blockchain to successfully execute real workloads of NASDAQ and Uber on a DApp without losing transactions. To demonstrate that TVPR and RPM are the causes of the improved performance, we compare SRBB with its naive baseline, which does not contain TVPR and RPM. Our results show that TVPR increases the throughput by 55× and divides the latency by 3.5, while RPM increases the throughput by 7% under flooding attacks. Finally, TVPR helps reduce transaction losses in the normal scenario while RPM goes further and mitigates transaction losses under flooding attacks.},
