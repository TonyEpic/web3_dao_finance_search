abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

abstract = {The metaverse, as a rapidly evolving socio-technical phenomenon, exhibits significant potential across diverse domains by leveraging Web3 (a.k.a. Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

abstract = {Since the emergence of bitcoin, 14 years ago, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins these virtual currencies have experienced a rapid growth, with a plethora of applications emerging. While most popular applications of blockchain technology are in the business field, its main features – such as decentralization or enhanced security – make it suitable to redesign social, cultural and political realities such as the social contract that regulates the relationship between states and citizens. Blockchain-based applications have the potential to change social values and the social contract itself. This paper aims to discover if smart contracts and blockchain technology can bind the social contract between the state and its citizens in such a way as to reduce corruption and increase efficiency of service delivery. Further, the emergence of a new type of social contract will be investigated: the smart social contract. This new concept aspires to enhance Jean Jacques Rousseau's social contract with the benefits inherent in blockchain technology. It involves an automatic execution of the obligations that a government assumes through a certain program, determined by consensus by all the members of society. In case of non-fulfillment of the obligations, the persons /institutions responsible are sanctioned appropriate penalties. We implement and evaluate a prototype of a smart social contract in Solidity, finding that the contract is capable of automatic execution upon the achievement of predetermined conditions, such as the fulfillment of an obligation by a local government official.},

abstract = {Regardless of which community, incentivizing users is a necessity for well-sustainable operations. In the blockchain-backed Web3 communities, known for their transparency and security, airdrop serves as a widespread incentive mechanism for allocating capital and power. However, it remains a controversy on how to justify airdrop to incentive and empower the decentralized governance. In this paper, we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role taxonomy methodology through a data-driven study to understand the characteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop. We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters. In conjunction with the results, we discuss from the aspects of interaction, financialization, and system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions for decentralized communities.},

abstract = {The social network Twitter possesses a key characteristic: it is centralized, allowing Twitter Corporation to control data substitution and set moderation rules. However, this issue can only be resolved through the complete decentralization of the platform. To achieve this, blockchain technology is crucial as it enables the operation of decentralized applications with smart contracts serving as the foundation for system-user interaction. In this paper, we propose the minimum viable implementation of a similar social network called Brain Logger, which stores all necessary data in the NEAR blockchain network. Introducing a small fee for modifying data on the network ensures a solution to the aforementioned problems. The implementation includes a smart contract for blockchain networks and a web application frontend. The smart contract was developed using the NEAR software development kit in Rust, while the frontend was created in JavaScript using the React framework and Redux for local data storage. The code can be accessed on Github.},

Enthusiasts claim DAOs provide new opportunities for openness, horizontality, and democratization. However, this phenomenon is still under research, especially given the lack of quantitative studies. This paper presents the first census-like quantitative analysis of the whole ecosystem of DAOs, including 30K DAO communities on the main DAO platforms. This enables us to provide insights into the allegedly "democratic'' nature of DAOs, building metrics concerning their lifespan, participation, and power concentration. Most DAOs have a short lifespan and low participation. There is also a positive correlation between community size and voting power concentration. Like other online communities, DAOs seem to follow the iron law: becoming increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Still, a significant amount of DAOs of varying sizes defy this idea by being egalitarian by design.},

abstract = {Web3 social media strives to eliminate the need for centralized management by building upon on technologies such public ledgers and smart contracts. This has generated significant hype, but creates many notable challenges, many of which remain unaddressed. One such challenge is content moderation. Specifically, the immutable nature of blockchain means that it becomes impossible to retrospectively delete posts. This means that illegal content posts cannot be moderated or removed. In an attempt to overcome this, Web3 platforms, such as memo.cash, allow users to filter out posts from their personal timelines. Taking memo.cash as a use case, the goal of this work is to study the efficacy of the approach, and identify associated challenges. A particularly unique feature of memo.cash is that users must pay money (satoshi) for each social action (e.g., posting and blocking other users). We conjecture that this may impact the nature of moderation, particularly among poorer users. To explore this, we gather data from memo.cash covering 24K&nbsp;users, 317K&nbsp;posts, and 2.57M user actions. We investigate how the need to pay may impact the moderation system and propose potential solutions to address the challenges that arise.},

To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive framework that identifies four core components of user interaction within the Web3 ecosystem: blockchain infrastructures, Web3-based Decentralized Applications (DApps), online communities, and off-chain cryptocurrency platforms. We delve into the security concerns perceived by users in each of these components and analyze the mitigation strategies they employ, ranging from risk assessment and aversion to diversification and acceptance. We further discuss the landscape of both technical and human-induced security risks in the Web3 ecosystem, identify the unique security differences between Web2 and Web3, and highlight key challenges that render users vulnerable, to provide implications for security design in Web3.},

This work considers blockchains as a socio-technical system of rules, in order to draw a comparison with legal systems. Following the comparison, one finds that most blockchains lack what, in legal theory, are considered secondary rules. That is, the meta-rule of the system.This works examines the relevant concepts and provides their definitions, then proceeds to outline concrete example of the failure of governance among popular blockchains before drawing the parallelism with legal systems and argue that secondary rules might solve some of the issues of the governance of blockchains.Secondary rules are the necessary infrastructure for building sound governance structures and a necessary condition for blockchains to succeed as a new mode of governance. The conclusion provides future research directions.},

abstract = {There has been growing interest in the so-called “Web3” movement. This loosely refers to a mix of decentralized technologies, often underpinned by blockchain technologies. Among these, Web3 social media platforms have begun to emerge. These store all social interaction data (e.g., posts) on a public ledger, removing the need for centralized data ownership and management. But this comes at a cost, which some argue is prohibitively expensive. As an exemplar within this growing ecosytem, we explore memo.cash, a microblogging service built on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. We gather data for 24K users, 317K posts, 2.57M user actions, which have facilitated $6.75M worth of transactions. A particularly unique feature is that users must pay BCH tokens for each interaction (e.g., posting, following). We study how this may impact the social makeup of the platform. We therefore study memo.cash as both a social network and a transaction platform.},

abstract = {The design of tokenomics, i.e., distribution and circulation mechanisms of cryptocurrency tokens, is a top priority for almost all Web3 applications which relates to their own economic systems via native cryptocurrency tokens. Unfortunately, while the sustainability of tokenomics largely determines the long-term development of a Web3 application, the tooling support for the design of it has been far too insufficient. A common practice at the time of writing is to specify tokenomics with a combination of documents, spreadsheets, code scripts etc.. In this paper, we introduce the TMI development platform for the modelling and analysis of Web3 tokenomics. TMI creates a domain-specific language and its graphical development environment for developers to succinctly model crypto-economic relations in a drag-and-drop way. Based on created models, TMI allows developers to formally analyse their tokenomics via checking fundamental economic properties, e.g., The core team of a project holds less than 20\% of the project token in 36 months. A demonstration video of TMI is available at https://youtu.be/LDn-eRxPMTw.},

abstract = {Securing and managing medical data in hospitals is one of the significant challenges still existing in healthcare. There can be different kinds of patients staying in hospitals with various diseases. All these medical data records need to be secured appropriately for future use and verification. In the hospital, there will be essential documents such as criminal cases and postmortem reports, although it is unclear if they are being handled properly or not. Even the hospital staff can alter these data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based secured medical data management system to manage access to each medical record in a network of hospitals. The proposed system has three main access management categories: one for securing general (fever or cold) medical report, category 2 for postmortem or crime reports security and category 3 for securing cancer /brain death /genetic disorder reports. Sensitive clinical data should not be visible to patients with cancer or genetic disorders as these patients have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Hence, the data is accessible only to doctors, family members, and researchers. The data related to the crime or postmortem reports have only limited access for those with legal permission to access and verify these types of reports. So through blockchain distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, we could store the data in a tamper-proof manner and manage the user access to these data.},

Until now, scientific efforts have been primarily focused on theoretical discussions about the implications of the technology and on technical proposals to improve and consolidate the underlying infrastructure, neglecting the experience of people using blockchain-based systems. However, for this technology to permeate the mainstream, blockchain technology should be easily accessible to the general public. This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps. Also, we saw how blockchain metaphors and transaction-mediated interactions challenge established mental models for modern applications, imposing heavy workloads on users. We conclude the paper by discussing design implications resulting from blockchain’s paradigm change.},

Soulbound tokens add an important piece to blockchain technology, as they could be the key to building Web3 and a trustworthy decentralized society. Issued and strictly linked to an account, representing the soul of a user, the soulbound token makes it possible to represent a property that only the user can have and that cannot be transferred, but only removed, which enhances security. To evaluate their impact on blockchain development, we first examine the concept of soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their effective adoption. The application sectors include the creation of digital identity certificates, ownership certificates, reputational certificates, governance, and the healthcare sector. We then report and describe relevant blockchain token standards, including soulbound token standards, provided in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Finally, to study the efficacy of the implementation of soulbound tokens, we propose a case study that includes the design and development of a decentralized vaccine certification prototype based on soulbound tokens. In our system, the vaccination data produced by the health authority is fully decentralized and implemented as the issuance of soulbound tokens for the benefit of a citizen's soul account. As a result, the citizen is the only owner of the vaccination data.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design, deployment and qualitative study of a large-scale, public, generative art exhibition, through which passers-by could create artworks, and mint a non-fungible-token (NFT). Following the month-long exhibition, during which 229 anonymous participants produced artworks, 69 non-transferable NFTs were minted, we surveyed (33) and interviewed (14) expert and novice participants about their experiences. We explored contemporary challenges of owning digital things, and the extent to which NFTs, and 'Web3' technologies offer meaningful forms of ownership. Our findings describe how the inability to trade this NFT, and its unique circumstances of acquisition, made it meaningful in ways that extended beyond its immediate (limited) utility and offered participants something through which to construct identity. Reflecting on the aspirations, contradictions, and misconceptions of forms of ownership enabled by NFTs, we conclude with proposals for renewed attention in HCI to the nature of digital possessions, and the potential for 'ownership design'.},

abstract = {The metaverse represents now one of the most promising innovations that lie under the umbrella of Web3-powered technologies. Its societal impact has important repercussions both on social good and on social computing. Among the technologies that are driving the metaverse, we find cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that are used to represent the property of goods and assets in the virtual worlds. In particular, NFTs are used to represent the parcels in which the metaverse is divided, with unknown consequences on the metaverse economy. In this paper, we explore the social impact of employing NFTs in the metaverse and propose an analysis of parcel sales taking Decentraland and The Sandbox as a case study. Our analysis uncovers that prices of the metaverse parcels are increasing over time and that acquiring parcels is becoming prohibitive. Additionally, we identify that the factors that drive the price of sales in the metaverse are the proximity to specific landmarks, like roads, squares, districts, or parcels owned by influencers or enterprises. We argue that this could be a factor in reducing the social good of the metaverse because it fuels a speculative market similar to the one of the physical estate.},

abstract = {Shared code in blockchains, known as smart contracts, stands to replace important parts of our digital governance and financial infrastructure. The permissionless execution of smart contracts is tightly coupled to cryptocurrencies and Proof-of-Work blockchains. As a result, smart contracts inherit the environmental impact of Proof-of-Work blockchains, such as its energy consumption, carbon footprint, and electronic waste. The four concepts of relaxed consistency, strong identities, probabilistic consensus, and the use of liabilities instead of assets may change the status quo. This work explores the integration of these concepts to decouple smart contracts from Proof-of-Work blockchains. By means of a local-first approach, which may expose users to inconsistent ephemeral contract states, the architecture of smart contracts can be transformed to become green. Because such contract states may be dropped, we base the interactions between users on liabilities. We propose a novel paradigm for smart contract architectures, named Green Smart Contracts, that is based on a local-first approach. Furthermore, we present and implement a prototype solution for this paradigm. We validate the need for a mechanism to resolve consistency violations by replaying the contract calls of a real smart contract. Our simulation shows that violations occur more often (13\% of contract invocations) when using liabilities than when using a traditional blockchain (3\% of contract invocations). However, we additionally validate that they can be avoided using a consensus mechanism, and our experiments show that a publish-subscribe messaging pattern uses the fewest messages to do so, though it may not be applicable for use cases that disallow the inherent imbalance in the messaging between peers. Our carbon emission estimation shows that a Green Smart Contract approach lowers carbon emissions by 52.31\% when compared with the messaging behavior of a typical peer-to-peer blockchain with 1000 nodes.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent deeds of ownership, based on blockchain technologies and smart contracts, of unique crypto assets on digital art forms (e.g., artworks or collectibles). In the spotlight after skyrocketing in 2021, NFTs have attracted the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors intent on placing promising investments in this profitable market. However, the NFT financial performance prediction has not been widely explored to date. In this work, we address the above problem based on the hypothesis that NFT images and their textual descriptions are essential proxies to predict the NFT selling prices. To this purpose, we propose MERLIN, a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed to train Transformer-based language and visual models, along with graph neural network models, on collections of NFTs’ images and texts. A key aspect in MERLIN is its independence on financial features, as it exploits only the primary data a user interested in NFT trading would like to deal with, i.e., NFT images and textual descriptions. By learning dense representations of such data, a price-category classification task is performed by MERLIN models, which can also be tuned according to user preferences in the inference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles. Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset has shown that MERLIN models achieve significant performances according to several financial assessment criteria, fostering profitable investments, and also beating baseline machine-learning classifiers based on financial features.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel multi-directional speaker, named MuDiS, which utilizes a parametric array to generate highly focused sound beams in multiple directions. The system capitalizes on air nonlinearity to reproduce sound from ultrasounds, successfully overcoming challenges inherent in traditional parametric arrays, such as transducer size and wavefront shape. It supports three important features simultaneously: independent beams, wide-angle digital steering, and unintended leakage suppression. To address these challenges, we designed a specialized cell structure that connects ultrasonic transducers, redirecting an approximately omnidirectional wavefront with optimal interspacing. An optimization-based algorithm is developed to minimize unintended leakages, and a nonlinear distortion reduction scheme is proposed to enhance sound quality. The paper showcases a prototype demonstrating the system's capabilities as a multidirectional speaker with a wide sound projection angle. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed multi-beam projection system rivals the performance of commercially available single-beam projection directional speakers, and improved steering angle and sound fidelity compared to multi-beamforming performance using traditional parametric arrays.},

We discuss the focus of the existing research body and juxtapose it to the changing landscape of emerging blockchain technologies to highlight future research avenues for HCI and interaction design. With this review, we identify key aspects where interaction design is critical for the adoption of blockchain systems.

abstract = {Vehicle based logistics are hinged on their ability to timely deliver goods, services, and people. The classical expression of “time is money” comes alive in the logistics industry yielding potentially huge financial and health consequences in case of missing deadlines. This is especially the case for time sensitive pharmaceuticals, delivery of perishable goods, delivery of people travelling, delivery of services in fault fixing/recovery sector. All these use cases motivate the need for an immutable, secure, and immortalized process of tracking time. To solve this challenge, this paper presents prototype-based research that integrates the 4th industrial revolution technologies of vision Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and blockchain. The developed prototype features a Raspberry-PI board embedding a camera, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to recognize plate letters from the image and a crypto wallet to sign the logging of plate number and time events on the NEAR blockchain, an emerging sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain that is simple to use, secure and scalable. The effective operation of the developed prototype has been validated inside a campus parking and shows an accuracy of 80\%. The benefits of transparency, security, and immutability of the blockchain combined with the intelligence, data capture, and processing of IoT will enable to develop accountability solutions trusted by all different logistic stakeholders.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, human daily life has become deeply bound to the Internet. To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some technical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the revolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings. Finally, we explore several challenges and issues in this promising area.},

abstract = {We identify a subtle security issue that impacts mechanism design in scenarios in which agents can absolutely commit to strategies, by which the strategy of an agent may depend on the commitments made by the other agents. This changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game of choosing which strategies to commit to. We say that a game that is unaffected by such commitments is Stackelberg resilient and show that computing it is intractable in general, though it can be computed efficiently for two-player games of perfect information. We show the intuitive, but technically non-trivial result, that if a game is resilient when some number of players can make commitments, it is also resilient when these commitments are available to fewer players. We demonstrate the non-triviality of Stackelberg resilience by analyzing two escrow mechanisms from the literature. These mechanisms have the same intended functionality, but we show that only one is Stackelberg resilient. Our model is particularly relevant in Web3 scenarios, where these commitments can be realized by the automated and irrevocable nature of smart contracts, and highlights an important issue in ensuring the secure design of Web3. In particular, our work suggests that smart contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks.},

Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83\% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.},

abstract = {Web3 is progressively decentralising Internet services with the introduction of the blockchain, from social networks to online trading. Filecoin is a Web3 storage marketplace implemented on top of the Interplanetary File System that aims at decentralising storage by rewarding users who pledge storage to the system. Clients form deals with storage miners, who store deals on the Filecoin blockchain for transparency and auditability. Storage miners can also obtain extra rewards when they mine a block. In this paper, we show that although Filecoin aims at complete decentralisation, the rewarding system acts as the opposite. We download a dataset composed of 47.5M messages and expose that most of the blocks are created by the same storage miners, who are also the ones that pledge more storage. An analysis of their identity shows that they belong to cloud companies, that have a lot of extra storage resources. The effect observed is due to the fact that storage miners are able to commit all extra storage to the system, even when there are no deals in them. Additionally, this effect is further intensified by recent updates to Filecoin, which let storage miners update committed storage to deal-containing storage effortlessly.},

abstract = {The control, governance, and management of the web have become increasingly centralised, resulting in security, privacy, and censorship concerns. Decentralised initiatives have emerged to address these issues, beginning with decentralised file systems. These systems have gained popularity, with major platforms serving millions of content requests daily. Complementing the file systems are decentralised search engines and name-registry infrastructures, together forming the basis of a decentralised web. This survey article analyses research trends and emerging technologies for content retrieval on the decentralised web, encompassing both academic literature and industrial projects.Several challenges hinder the realisation of a fully decentralised web. Achieving comparable performance to centralised systems without compromising decentralisation is a key challenge. Hybrid infrastructures, blending centralised components with verifiability mechanisms, show promise to improve decentralised initiatives. While decentralised file systems have seen more mature deployments, they still face challenges such as usability, performance, privacy, and content moderation. Integrating these systems with decentralised name-registries offers a potential for improved usability with human-readable and persistent names for content. Further research is needed to address security concerns in decentralised name-registries and enhance governance and crypto-economic incentive mechanisms.},

abstract = {Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored for particular domains. Many frameworks and tools have been proposed to develop editors for DSLs, especially for desktop IDEs, like Eclipse.We are witnessing the advent of low-code development platforms, which are cloud-based environments supporting rapid application development by using graphical languages and forms. While this approach is very promising, the creation of new low-code platforms may require the migration of existing desktop-based editors to the web. However, this is a technically challenging task.To fill this gap, we present ROCCO, a tool that migrates Eclipse-based graphical modelling editors to the web, to facilitate their integration with low-code platforms. The tool reads a meta-model annotated with EuGENia annotations, and generates a web editor using the DPG web framework used by the UGROUND company. In this paper, we present the approach, including tool support and an evaluation based on migrating nine editors created by third parties, which shows the usefulness of the tool.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized access control framework with transitive delegation capabilities that tackles the performance and scalability limitations of the existing state-of-the-art solutions. In order to accomplish this, the proposed solution is anchored in the self-sovereign identity (SSI) paradigm, which embodies a distributed identity management system. By adopting this paradigm, we obviate slow cryptographic premises such as identity-based encryption (IBE) that were used in prior work. Furthermore, we enhance the existing verifiable credentials (VCs) from this paradigm by introducing our own decentralized permission objects to support the concept of transitive delegations. This concept allows delegates to further delegate their access to resources with the same or fewer privileges to other entities within the framework. This renders our solution suitable for diverse scenarios, including applications in decentralized building access management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of transitive delegations in this paradigm. Finally, our performance experiments show a performance enhancement of three orders of magnitude compared to the prevailing state-of-the-art solutions.},

Blockchain allows different communities to create Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), which are self-organised democratic organisations controlled by smart contracts. This paper presents a new DAO model for the procurement of services by public organisations, such as government agencies. To demonstrate the advantages of this solution, this work looks specifically at current public procurement systems that resort to third-party contractors that manage these negotiations. Third parties lack the transparency, security, and democratic representation that a DAO can provide. We present the implementation of a DAO as a set of smart contracts executed on Ethereum-compatible permissionless blockchains, supported by a consensus algorithm, replacing third-party contractors.},

abstract = {Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are prone to various vulnerabilities, leading to substantial financial losses over time. Current analysis tools mainly target vulnerabilities with fixed control- or data-flow patterns, such as re-entrancy and integer overflow. However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed that about 80\% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the lack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring how Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) could aid in detecting logic vulnerabilities.In this paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static analysis for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying solely on GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false positives and is limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a versatile code understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability type into scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities with GPT. To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently recognize key variables and statements, which are then validated by static confirmation. Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects and 3K Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90\%) for token contracts and acceptable precision (57.14\%) for large projects like Web3Bugs. It effectively detects ground-truth logic vulnerabilities with a recall of over 70\%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors. GPTScan is fast and cost-effective, taking an average of 14.39 seconds and 0.01 USD to scan per thousand lines of Solidity code. Moreover, static confirmation helps GPTScan reduce two-thirds of false positives.},

abstract = {(Un)real Estates is a project and platform that explores a counterfactual narrative of the physical city and its digital counterpart. It is a provocation about the commercialisation of the infrastructure of the spatial internet. (Un)real Estates presents a proto-architectural sequence and experience between particles and pixels, matter, and event.In virtual jumpspace, machines and search terms hallucinate spatial configurations, while random probability distributions and large language models generate new topologies. This creates a stochastic architecture that is the inadvertent realisation of an architectural fantasy - architecture without architecture.The project integrates digital media techniques and architectural design syntax to explore an immersive architectural experience where the physical and virtual are fused as seamless interfaces. The project provides new ways of engaging with the built environment, and operates at limits of material practice, extending the spaces open to the architectural imagination.(Un)real Estates forestalls the terminal end of the metropolitan experiment and is an epistle to the post-urban technotopia, with all its manifold tensions and misgivings. It is a postscript for the city on the cusp of a technological singularity. By presenting a near-future scenario, (Un)real Estates serves as a cautionary tale to consider the potential consequences of the unabridged networked speculative enterprise.The project responds to the theme of (dis)engagement, and utilises AI, Machine Learning, explores subjects of data extractivism, data governance, physical and digital artefacts, and decentralised blockchain and digital ledger technologies.},

As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

However, to fully realize the potential of DT, companies require robust and scalable front-end solutions. This study proposes harnessing micro-frontend technologies to surmount the limitations of monolithic front-end frameworks, thereby crafting effective presentation layers tailored for industrial companies. By decomposing complex and distributed systems into modular web-based DT, the proposed framework enables better scalability, synergy, and efficient application development. It also tackles the intricacies introduced by complex multi-vendor elements within DT and the orchestration of services and virtual environments. Research is focused on developing an architecture that facilitates seamless connectivity between multiple blocks of DT as well as interactivity and immersive experiences. Our study offers insights into our journey of implementing this framework for various industrial use cases, such as training, monitoring, and control, highlighting the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges. Ultimately, this research aims to accelerate the creation of DT, improve maintainability, and increase efficiency and productivity in industrial environments.},

Different access control systems have been proposed for different IoT environments, many are remaining only at a conceptual level. In this paper, we propose a decentralized, ledger-based, publish-subscribe based architecture for the administration of access in a smart home IoT environment to preside at the assignments of underlying operational authorizations. Proposed architecture is endorsed by a proof-of-concept implementation, which utilizes smart contracts to ensure the integrity of administration supplemented by intrinsic benefits of blockchain to be distributed and transparent. Despite the rising hype around the blockchain technology that stokes its utilization in different domains, utilizing it for access control purposes is not yet promising. Our implementation results assure using blockchain for administrative access control is propitious, while is not yet appropriate for operational access control, which have been mainly the focus of previously proposed blockchain-based access control works.},
