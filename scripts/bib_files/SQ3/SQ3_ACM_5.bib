abstract = {This study aims to understand communicative activities of an illicit cyber-trade community on an anonymous social platform, Reddit. Based on the communication-as-constitutive of organization (CCO) perspective, the study identifies participants with different levels of engagement, and examines how their discursive engagement collectively reflects the ways in which illicit market users co-orient themselves to respond to a crisis event (i.e., market shutdown). The empirical case for this study is a subreddit channel dedicated to what was once the largest dark web market: r/AlphabayMarket. We examine two month period's posting activities until market was permanently shut down in July 2017. Our analysis comprises three parts. First, a social network analysis was conducted to identify key and non-key players in the community. Second, a structural topic modeling was computed to inductively infer topic clusters. Third, posts were manually reviewed to articulate the process of co-orientation manifest in the results of topic modeling.},

abstract = {In an effort to contain the Covid-19 pandemic emergency, nations have sponsored smartphones apps tracing contacts. The ultimate aim is to alert people when a Covid-19-positive has been found and it occurs that they have been in close contact with the positive. In the context of contact tracing, transparency of data gathered is of utmost importance to show beyond doubt that the people privacy is preserved as much as possible. The proposed approach aims at making gathered data publicly available in such a way that anonymity is preserved and stored data are immutable and not owned by a single organization. For this, we equip users in a university environment with an app that reveals their presence as a proximity to a WiFi access point. While the server-side provides location ids to apps, the location history is kept within the app and checks for a possible contact are performed by the app. The server aggregates presence data related to each WiFi access point according to time-slots, and stores these periodically in a blockchain for maximum transparency and immutability. The tests on the developed prototype have shown the accuracy in determining presence data, the feasibility for apps to interact with smart contracts and to have daily presence data stored in a blockchain. The ability to exhibit official and immutable statistics on people gathering at university should be useful to give evidence of the effort to have controlled accesses and gathering avoidance.},

abstract = {Within a globalized world, Portuguese culture lives between the poles of international influence and the strong inertia of their own cultural structure and dynamics, traditionally peripherical to the rest of the Western world. Portuguese cultural institutions and museums have shown an extremely cautious position in recent decades. They have remained reluctant to adapt to changes and foster new creative proposals out of the reach of the “fine arts” idea. This has led to an underestimation of new artistic currents, especially those related to new technologies. New media art is probably the art more attached to the present time. It is constantly evolving, everchanging, and very close to the quick evolution of culture and society. Despite the growing digital literacy rates reached in recent years, the digital culture has not been embraced by museums in Portugal. New media art has not been collected by official institutions, and it is almost not being exhibited and preserved for the future. The lack of institutional support provokes a deepening of the precariousness experienced by artists and the artworks. Consumed whether in the form of images appearing on platforms or social networks, whether as ephemeral works in festivals and performances, new media art is as obsolescent as weak, liquid following Bauman's term. New media art is a potential heritage at risk. This study tries to analyze this paradoxical situation, searching for the cause of the absence of new media art and, in general, the creativity related to new technologies in the official Portuguese culture. On the other hand, this research explores the dynamics of a digital culture forged in a parallel alternative structure sustained by festivals, prizes, associations, research labs and some other projects. These sources allow us to create a whole map of the country's surprisingly rich, new media art realm.},

abstract = {With the explosion of COVID-19 cases and the government’s needs to control virus spreading, the development of effective and robust systems for managing vaccination certificates to restrict citizens’ activities has been in the centre of many governments. This paper proposes a system that allows for the update of the status of certificates and bases its function on a specific form of logs stored on Blockchains and a set of rules for the interpretation of these logs. Also an outline of a proof of concept implementation of the system in Ethereum together with a cost and security analysis are provided in the paper. The proposed architecture provides several benefits with the most prominent one being the suspension of certificates in case an already vaccinated individual is found positive. In existing certificate management systems a vaccinated individual that is tested positive still holds a valid vaccination certificate during the self-isolation period. This vulnerability allows infected individuals to commute freely and thus facilitates the spread of the pandemic. The proposed solution is not limited to COVID-19 related certificates, but rather it could be deployed in any kind of digital certificate.},

abstract = {We propose Shard Scheduler, a system for object placement and migration in account-based sharded blockchains. Our system calculates optimal placement and decides on object migrations across shards. It supports complex multi-account transactions caused by smart contracts. Placement and migration decisions made by Shard Scheduler are fully deterministic, verifiable, and can be made part of the consensus protocol. Shard Scheduler reduces the number of costly cross-shard transactions, ensures balanced load distribution and maximizes the number of processed transactions for the blockchain as a whole. To this end, it leverages a novel incentive model motivating miners to maximize the global throughput of the entire blockchain rather than the throughput of a specific shard. In our simulations, Shard Scheduler can reduce the number of costly cross-shard transactions by half while ensuring equal load and increasing throughput more than 2 fold when using 60 shards. We also implement and evaluate Shard Scheduler on Chainspace, more than doubling its throughput and reducing user-perceived latency by 70\% when using 10 shards.},

abstract = {In today's digital world, enterprises and individuals are generating massive data that is potentially useful for many data consumers with data driven applications. The emergence of data marketplaces is a step toward helping the data owners to monetize their digital assets and get connected to the potential buyers. The current data marketplaces cannot handle the challenges related to data ownership claims, illegal redistribution, and data ownership traceability. To overcome these problems in a general-purpose market, we propose a marketplace based on watermarking and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) technologies. In the proposed NFT-based marketplace, the owner's data is stored as an NFT where the underlying content of the NFT holds the watermarked data. The watermarked data is obtained by embedding some information about the owners and the buyers into the original data. The embedded information can later be extracted to identify the owner and the buyer of the traded data. Furthermore, the transactions corresponding to the NFT provide verifiable ownership proof and traceable ownership history. A Proof-Of-Concept (POC) implementation of the proposed marketplace that will be integrated within AI-Gallery Data Marketplace service in Huawei Cloud is presented for trading image data. An extensive set of experiments to measure the gas consumption on the blockchain and evaluate the robustness of the watermarked assets against 51 attacks are performed. Finally, a method based on error correction codes is proposed for improving the watermarking robustness in the implemented marketplace. The link for the codes and the POC demo is provided in the appendix.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a cloud based public key infrastructure utilizing blockchain technology model for replacing the currently outdated traditional variant. Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6\% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87\%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface.},

The underlying technology, Blockchain, shifts the responsibility for securing assets to the end-user and requires them to manage their (private) keys. Little attention has been given to how cryptocurrency users handle the challenges of key management in practice and how they select the tools to do so. To close this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=10). Our thematic analysis revealed prominent themes surrounding motivation, risk assessment, and coin management tool usage in practice. We found that the choice of tools is driven by how users assess and balance the key risks that can lead to loss: the risk of (1) human error, (2) betrayal, and (3) malicious attacks. We derive a model, explaining how risk assessment and intended usage drive the decision which tools to use. Our work is complemented by discussing design implications for building systems for the crypto economy.},

Through interviews with 24 users, we explore reasons for selecting wallets in different contexts. Participants opt for smart contract wallets to simplify key management, leveraging social interactions. However, they prefer personal devices over individuals as guardians to avoid social cybersecurity concerns in managing guardian relationships. When engaging in high-stakes or complex transactions, they often choose browser-based wallets, leveraging third-party security extensions. For simpler transactions, they prefer the convenience of mobile wallets. Many participants avoid hardware wallets due to usability issues and security concerns with respect to key recovery service provided by manufacturer and phishing attacks. Social networks play a dual role: participants seek security advice from friends, but also express security concerns in soliciting this help. We offer novel insights into how and why users adopt specific wallets. We also discuss design recommendations for future wallet technologies based on our findings.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.},

abstract = {ERC-20R is a wrapper around ERC-20 that supports asset recovery within a limited time window after an asset is transferred. It is designed to reduce theft and losses on the blockchain by allowing a victim to recover their stolen or lost assets during the recovery window. When an honest recipient receives an ERC-20R asset, they must wait until the recovery windows elapses (say, 24 hours), before they can unwrap the asset back to its base ERC-20 form. We argue that many DeFi services will likely refuse to accept unsettled recoverable assets because they can interfere with their normal operations. Consequently, when Alice receives an ERC-20R token, she must wait 24 hours before she can use it with a DeFi service. But what if Alice is willing to pay a fee to exchange the wrapped token for an unwrapped ERC-20 token that can be used right away? In this paper we explore how to design a pool to exchange an unsettled ERC-20R asset for a base ERC-20 of the same asset. Designing such a pool raises several challenging questions and we present our solutions.},

This overlooks the communities developing novel creative practices on NFT platforms. Interviews with 16 creatives utilizing NFTs reveal a vast Art World: networks of distinct communities maturing into cooperative ecosystems with unique artistic subcultures, philosophies, and interactions. We observe unique qualities of these decentralized distribution platforms and identify patterns of activity comparable to those of traditional art worlds. We identify how aspects of these systems might subvert, or replicate, existing systems of power, value, and access. The impacts of policy and platform design on online creative communities in the NFT Art World carry valuable lessons for developers of digital interventions into the creative industry, exemplifying pertinent considerations for the future of creative labor and cooperation online.},

abstract = {A blockchain is designed to make consistent and reliable agreement in an unreliable and decentralized environment. It also permits processing transactions, making smart contracts, which allows end users to perform the contracts without any intermediate entities. However, there are some challenges in retrieving the state in a smart contract on the blockchain. For example, an external database or user-defined data structures can be used to retrieve the data from a smart contract in a range, which can increase the management overhead and decrease the overall performance of the blockchain system. In this paper, we propose a scheme that enables SQL query operations in a blockchain system. In our proposed scheme, the register and query managers provide fast retrieval of range data without any user-defined data structure, and management at low cost without any external database, respectively. We have implemented our scheme on quorum which is an Ethereum-based blockchain system and evaluated it using a synthetic benchmark. The experimental results show that our system can improve the search performance up to about 22x compared with the existing system with low memory usage.},

abstract = {The growing popularity of online social media (OSM) has led to the creation of a wide amount of social media platforms. In this context, the increasing competition among platforms and the emergence of decentralized alternatives such as Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM), have led to more frequent user migrations: individuals tend to switch platforms in search of improved features, content, or communities. Therefore there has been increasing interest in user migration studies modeling and predicting user migration. However, user migration, especially in blockchain-based platforms remains an understudied problem. Existing methods rely on user activity to derive interaction graphs and then address the user migration prediction problem as a node classification task, where user decisions are encoded as node labels. While the performance look promising, there are currently two important research gaps: i) there is no work using graph neural networks, the state-of-the-art in machine learning on graphs; and ii) there is a lack of methods designed to improve prediction performance in the case of class imbalance, i.e. the presence of dominant behavior among the ones to predict. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict user migration in BOSM. We model the data as a directed temporal multilayer graph, capturing social and monetary interactions among users. To address the problem of class imbalance in node classification, we introduce a data-level balancing technique following an undersampling approach. The evaluation, conducted on data describing user migration across blockchain online social media platforms, shows that graph neural networks are a suitable machine learning approach to perform user migration prediction. Furthermore, the proposed undersampling approach improves predictive power on severely imbalanced data. These results highlight how graph neural networks are effective in predicting user migration, without the need for manual feature engineering and in the absence of user information. Our methodology holds potential for applications beyond user migration, such as fraud detection and bot detection, and opens up venues for further research in other prediction tasks in online social networks and blockchain-based systems.},

abstract = {Without relying on centralized intermediaries to participate in financial services such as exchanging and lending assets, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has set off a new paradigm of asset self-management. On the other hand, data as an emerging asset becomes increasingly significant in our daily life. How to self-manage our data assets to raise their value deserves further exploration. Inspired by DeFi, we envision a decentralized eco-system/community where people can donate or trade data end-to-end for the public good and/or maximize data value. This paper explores this vision by building a DeFi-based data sharing and trading system. In order to explore the actual value of data in the market, we propose an elastic data pricing scheme that can dynamically adjust data prices based on data usage and timing. Finally, we implement and integrate these critical components into a prototyping system deployed onto Ethereum - the current leading blockchain system, and evaluate the system service performance, smart contracts functionality, and the robustness of the data pricing scheme.},

abstract = {Software supply chain compromises are on the rise. From the effects of XCodeGhost to SolarWinds, hackers have identified that targeting weak points in the supply chain allows them to compromise high-value targets such as U.S. government agencies and corporate targets such as Google and Microsoft. Software signing, a promising mitigation for many of these attacks, has seen limited adoption in open-source and enterprise ecosystems.In this paper, we propose Sigstore, a system to provide widespread software signing capabilities. To do so, we designed the system to provide baseline artifact signing capabilities that minimize the adoption barrier for developers. To this end, Sigstore leverages three distinct mechanisms: First, it uses a protocol similar to ACME to authenticate developers through OIDC, tying signatures to existing and widely-used identities. Second, it enables developers to use ephemeral keys to sign their artifacts, reducing the inconvenience and risk of key management. Finally, Sigstore enables user authentication by means of artifact and identity logs, bringing transparency to software signatures. Sigstore is quickly becoming a critical piece of Internet infrastructure with more than 2.2M signatures over critical software such as Kubernetes and Distroless.},

The problems of traceability, non-counterfeiting and unique usage of digital coupons fall within this area; many couponing platforms are hence exploring the possibility of addressing the above limitations with blockchain technologies. In view of the foregoing, in this work we analyse and compare several blockchain-based couponing systems. To do so, we first propose a general schema of digital coupon and define the desirable properties of a couponing system. Then, we select a sample of these systems and we examine them, describing their design choices and summarizing their relevant properties. Finally, we inspect their code and study how the notion of couponing system is interpreted in their smart contracts. We also highlight their distinctive features and relevant implementation solutions. We conclude by discussing what emerged from our analysis and proposing some possible future investigations.},

However, the existing blockchain Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) approaches for secondary students are inadequate. In this study, we designed a tailored workshop for secondary students and examined the effectiveness of introducing blockchain concepts in the context of metaverse by implementation. The workshop integrated four educational theories, including Transfer of Learning, Interest Theory, Situated Learning, and Experiential Learning. The synthesis of typical theories gives rise to an innovative education strategy aimed at facilitating a transfer of awareness and interest from the metaverse domain to the blockchain domain, which is also the workshop’s ultimate goal. The workshop was designed considering the developmental status of secondary school students and its alignment with the Hong Kong secondary curriculum framework to accomplish the learning objective of enhancing their knowledge, skill, awareness and interest in blockchain technology. 225 secondary students joined the workshop, and the findings demonstrated that our approach is effective and the adoption of the transfer from the metaverse domain to the blockchain domain is feasible. The results of this paper may serve as a successful example of blockchain education for secondary students.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on addressing the prevalent issues related to established Verifiable Random Function (VRF) schemes and presents our novel VRF scheme. Our proposed distributed VRF scheme employs multi-party computation (MPC) where each participant is identified by their own decentralized identifiers (DID) on a blockchain network, making the collective randomness by preventing any single participant from determining the output of the VRF. We further aim to enhance the randomness of our VRF scheme by utilizing a successor rule-based de Bruijn sequence to generate pseudo-random numbers with a strong balanced property, ensuring both numbers of 1s and 0s are equal. For generic VRF construction, we adapt the approach of selective-secure VRF scheme using verifiable functional encryption (VFE), which is a more generalized version of homomorphic encryption plus verifiability. Moreover, we estimate the security aspects of our VRF scheme and the entropy approximation based on the information-theoretic perfect secrecy model. Also, using the NIST SP800-22 test suite for randomness, we demonstrate the randomness performance with a 98.29\% overall pass rate on the total 176 tests of 11 standard tests and 0.6765 of the average p -value for statistical randomness. We provide technical details on implementing our VRF MPC model in the Solidity smart contract.},

abstract = {Blockchain is undoubtedly one of the most potentially attractive technologies for the organization of financial services. The significance of the Blockchain technology in a banking system can be determined by three main principles that is; Disintermediation, Transparency and Provenance. The DLT (distributed ledger technology) eliminates the need for trust enforcer in the banking management system. This is made possible by the tamper- proof data in the distributed data records and all the participants in the network have the same version of data record with them at all times and it is unalterable. Blockchain promotes a public database record of all the customer transactions and other data, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy system as the customers have a 24x7 real-time access to it. Blockchain keeps an immutable distributed data ledger of transactions and this result in maintaining a lifecycle of the assets and its ownership from its first transaction to the most recent one. It reduces the chances of occurrence of theft, insurance fraud and misselling of the high valued assets or intellectual properties. Blockchain can be implemented in the banking sector for various applications like maintenance of data confidentiality, cheque clearing system, real time money transfer system (digital currency), supply chain finance, insurance, trade finance, KYC (know your customer), cross-border payments/transactions system, monitoring of consortium accounts, auction system and digital asset management. Blockchain technology can hence enable a decentralized solution for the banking ecosystem. The proposed system enables one platform for both the lenders and the borrowers to initiate their money transaction for lending, borrowing and repayment of the loan money. The transactions made throughout, that is, from the start to the last repayment can be viewed easily on a blockchain network thus increasing the transparency and trust of the customers and it resolves any disputes that can arise in the loan system. Along with this, a KYC registry based on blockchain is also proposed which will help in maintaining the KYC details in one platform which can be accessed by various banks for identification and verification of the customer in an easy and faster manner. It will increase the customer satisfaction as there will be no need for the customer to perform a KYC check every time he/she creates a bank account in any bank as the bank can easily access their KYC details from this system.},

abstract = {By rendering game scenes on the remote cloud and delivering real-time video to end devices via the Internet, cloud gaming enables players to access game services anytime anywhere despite the hardware capacity of their terminals. However, as a commercial service, the state-of-the-art payment models for cloud gaming are still in their preliminary stages. In this paper, we reveal the shortages of existing cloud gaming pricing models and propose CloudArcade, a token-based cloud gaming system that employs blockchain-empowered cryptocurrency as a payment method for the players using the cloud gaming services. By using cryptocurrency, CloudArcade provides a transparent and resource-aware pricing method, it also enables a time irrelevant silent payment on the floating price to protects users' payment. These features eliminate the quality of experience degradation caused by the spot price in the traditional dynamic pricing model on the QoE-aware service pricing. We also employ the payment channel in CloudArcade to improve the system performance. Discussions on service pricing criteria are put forward, open issues about token issuing and malicious resource speculation are also reviewed. We believe the design of CloudArcade can show a good generality on other QoE-aware and human-centered applications.},

abstract = {The traceability of drugs remains a significant issue, especially with the number of products proposed on the Web. Detecting counterfeit products is a challenge, given what these products could represent as a danger to health and the economy. Several studies have been made in the literature and tried to propose solutions. However, several limitations remain. In this context, this paper presents our framework, ChainDrugTrac, for the traceability and detection of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. After studying existing work and identifying the limits, our contributions could be resumed around 1) proposing architecture for drug traceability based on the blockchain and 2) developing a blockchain-based prototype supporting the proposed architecture. The prototype has been implemented to evaluate our proposal and show its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Utilizing graph analytics and learning has proven to be an effective method for exploring aspects of crypto economics such as network effects, decentralization, tokenomics, and fraud detection. However, the majority of existing research predominantly focuses on leading cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), overlooking the vast diversity among the more than 10,000 cryptocurrency projects. This oversight may result in skewed insights. In our paper, we aim to broaden the scope of investigation to encompass the entire spectrum of cryptocurrencies, examining various coins across their entire life cycles. Furthermore, we intend to pioneer advanced methodologies, including graph transfer learning and the innovative concept of "graph of graphs". By extending our research beyond the confines of BTC and ETH, our goal is to enhance the depth of our understanding of crypto economics and to advance the development of more intricate graph-based techniques.},

abstract = {Numerous supply-chain combines with internet of things (IoT) applications have been proposed, and many methods and algorithms enhance the convenience of supply chains. However, new businesses still find it challenging to enter a supply chain, because unauthorised IoT devices of different companies illegally access resources. As security is paramount in a supply chain, IoT management has become very difficult. Public resources allocation and waste management also pose a problem. To solve the above problems, we proposed a new IoT management framework that embraces blockchain technology to help companies to form a supply chain effectively. This framework consists of an access control system, a backup peer mechanism and an internal data isolation and transmission approach. The access control system has a registrar module and an inspection module. The registrar module is mainly responsible for information registration with a registration policy, which has to be followed by all the companies in the supply chain. Besides, it provides a revocation and updating function. The inspection module focuses on judging misbehaviour and monitors the actions of the subjects; when any misoperation occurs, the system will correspondingly penalise violators. So that all related actions and information are verified and stored into blockchain, the IoT access control and safety of IoT admission are enhanced. Furthermore, in a blockchain system, if one single peer in the network breaks down, then the whole system may stop, because consensus cannot be reached. The data of the broken peer may be lost if it does not commit yet. The backup peer mechanism allows the primary peer and the backup peer to connect to an inspecting server for acquiring real-time data. The internal data isolation and transmission modules transmit and stores private data without creating a new subchannel. The proposed method is taken full account of the stability of the network and the fault tolerance to guarantee the robust of the system. To obtain unbiases results, experiments are conducted in two different blockchain environment. The results show our proposed method are promising IoT blockchain system for the supply chain.},

abstract = {The security and usability of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications depend on the secure management of cryptographic keys. However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work we first revisit the problem of threshold ECDSA by considering the commonly admissible 'server-aided' model, namely, the presence of a semi-honest and non-colluding service provider. Then, we leverage that model and consider cases where that 'server' is distributed, introducing the novel concept of unstoppable wallets; hence eliminating any single point of failure. Unstoppable wallets are programmable threshold ECDSA wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We construct highly efficient threshold ECDSA protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security in the server-aided model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority among the signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold ECDSA key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead.We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these protocols, written in a smart contract language, deployed on the Secret Network - a blockchain that plays the role of the server. Using that deployment, we showcase the protocols' applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.},

abstract = {This paper explores the economic implications of outsourcing data and computation to a cloud provider in comparison to maintaining an on-premise data center. Our investigation is twofold: contrasting a private data center with a trusted cloud, and the evaluation of the costs associated with securing an untrusted (e.g., honest-but-curious) cloud. We revisit prior cost models based on the current cost of CPU cycles and cryptographic operations. To evaluate the cost of securing a public cloud, we compare execution in AWS EC2 with AWS Clean Rooms, which facilitates encrypted querying. Our study offers a nuanced perspective on the economic feasibility of different cloud computing paradigms, providing essential insights for organizations contemplating the transition from local infrastructure to public cloud providers. Additionally, our analysis sheds light on the cost implications of securing against trusted insider threats, emphasizing the importance of aligning cloud computing decisions with an organization's risk tolerance and security posture. Outsourcing computation to a trusted cloud provider is economical today as cloud costs have declined since 2010, but securing against an untrusted cloud remains economically unviable despite advances in secure query processing and new cloud services.},
