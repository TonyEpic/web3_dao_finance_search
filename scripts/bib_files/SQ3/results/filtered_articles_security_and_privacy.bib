 abstract = {This article discusses secure methods to conduct e-voting over a blockchain in three different settings: decentralized voting, centralized remote voting, and centralized polling station voting. These settings cover almost all voting scenarios that occur in practice. A proof-of-concept implementation for decentralized voting over Ethereum’s blockchain is presented. This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

 abstract = {Transferring data and value across different blockchains is one of the biggest obstacles to further expansion. Blockchain interoperability allows different networks to communicate and transfer data between them and are increasingly crucial for blockchain applications. However, the concern about security and privacy in blockchain interoperability arises naturally. This work aims to provide the state-of-the-art related to security and privacy challenges in blockchain interoperability. We conducted a multivocal literature review (MLR) and analyzed 16 scientific and 30 grey literature, respectively. We examined different security and privacy challenges related to both blockchain in general and blockchain interoperability approaches such as Notary Schemes, Sidechains and Hashed Time-Lock Contracts. Possible mitigations are analysed, and open challenges that arose from the mitigations are highlighted.},

 abstract = {Security and privacy are primary concerns in IoT management. Security breaches in IoT resources, such as smart sensors, can leak sensitive data and compromise the privacy of individuals. Effective IoT management requires a comprehensive approach to prioritize access security and data privacy protection. Digital twins create virtual representations of IoT resources. Blockchain adds decentralization, transparency, and reliability to IoT systems. This research integrates digital twins and blockchain to manage access to IoT data streaming. Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration. The research presented in this paper enables multitenant access and customization of data streaming views and abstracts the complexity of data access management. This approach provides access and configuration security and data privacy protection.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilized in manufacturing industries produce vast volumes of valuable data that can revolutionize productivity and sustainability. While existing centralized data marketplaces facilitate data trading, they are often marred by trust issues, a single point of failure, and significant security and privacy vulnerabilities. Addressing these critical shortcomings, this paper introduces a blockchain-based industrial data trading system that not only ensures secure and transparent data trading but also offers advantages over conventional systems. Unlike traditional marketplaces, our proposed system emphasizes trustworthiness by mitigating third-party risks, enhancing data integrity through decentralized storage, and employing graph technology for efficient blockchain querying. Further, with integrated access control, our system elevates security standards. Preliminary evaluations reveal the system’s potential to offer a more secure, transparent, auditable, and trustworthy data trading environment, distinctly outpacing the capabilities of current marketplaces.},

@article{POPOOLA2024100178,
 abstract = {Protecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.},
