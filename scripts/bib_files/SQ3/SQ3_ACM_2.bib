abstract = {Developing and maintaining a large software package is a complex task. Decisions are made early in the design process that affect i) the ability of a user to effectively exploit the package and ii) the ability of a software engineer to maintain it. This case study discusses issues in software development and maintainability of a scientific package called SnB, which is used to determine molecular crystal structures. The design of the user interface is discussed along with important software engineering concepts, including modular programming, data encapsulation, and internal code documentation. Fortran is a language that is still widely used in the scientific community. Issues concerning the integration of Fortran into a modern scientific application with a C-based user interface are also discussed. Scientific applications benefit from being available on a wide variety of platforms. Due to demand, SnB is available on a variety of sequential and parallel platforms. Methods used in the design of SnB for such portability are presented including POSIX compliance, automatic configuration scripts, and parallel programming techniques.},

ASPLOS ’23 features 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and papers will be published in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision. For this volume of ASPLOS ’23, we discontinued the use of the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS ’21 and ASPLOS ’22. We found the extended abstract offered limited filtering and moved to a more traditional two phase review process. Each paper received 3 reviews in phase 1 and papers with positive scores advanced to the second round and received up to 2 more reviews. In our preface to Volume III, we will give a more detailed rundown of how the process worked.},

abstract = {The anonymity, multi-show unlinkability, and selective disclosure property of anonymous credentials enables users to access third-party services without revealing unnecessary details or being profiled. Threshold-based anonymous credentials provide a distributed framework to issue these credentials. While all of this enhances privacy, anonymity can also be misused and some schemes, therefore, have an opening mechanism, which enables the authorities to trace a user's identity. Nevertheless, relying solely on this measure is inadequate as the users can continue to use their previously issued anonymous credentials to authenticate themselves successfully with the service providers. To address this issue, we propose a revocation mechanism for such schemes using dynamic threshold accumulators (DTA) (Helminger et al. 2021). We first formally define a generic threshold-based anonymous credentials with an opening scheme (TACO) and subsequently propose an extension of TACO, "Revocable TACO (RTACO)" - revocable threshold-based credentials over blockchains - that integrates a revocation mechanism based on DTAs to the TACO system. In RTACO, we integrate a revocation handle into the credential as an extra attribute, allowing the disclosure of this attribute during the opening phase, which is then used to blocklist the credential, preventing its further use. We formally prove the security of this scheme in the universal composability (UC) framework. We also give a proof-of-concept implementation of RTACO over the Ethereum blockchain.},

abstract = {Decentralized finance (DeFi) enables crypto-asset holders to conduct complex financial transactions, while maintaining control over their assets in the blockchain ecosystem. However, the transparency of blockchain networks and the open mechanism of DeFi applications also cause new security issues. In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.},

abstract = {Throughout this paper, we try to describe with blockchain technology the decentralization of the internet. A decentralized network that encourages the internet to operate from the smartphone or tablet of anybody instead of centralized servers. A decentralized implementation would be based on a peer-to-peer network that is dependent on a user community. Their machines connected to the internet will host the network, not a community of more powerful servers. Each site would be distributed across thousands of nodes on various devices. The data is therefore not contained, owned by private storage facilities. There is therefore no central point to hack, and no way for an oligarchy of entities to take control of it. A proposed alternative was formed based on a systematic literature review that demonstrates that Internet decentralization is what this modern technology needs in order to address not only the weaknesses of current servers including server down issue, hacking and data manipulation or single point of failure, but also to prevent companies from monetizing the data of citizens through their server and to market them to the advertisers.},

abstract = {DNS has often been criticized for inherent design flaws, which make the system vulnerable to attack. Further, domain names are not fully controlled by users, meaning that they can easily be taken down by authorities and registrars. Due to this, there have been efforts to build a decentralized name service that gives greater control to domain owners. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a major example. Yet, no existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, particularly regarding security and misbehavior. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement study of ENS. Our findings suggest that ENS has shown growth during its four years' evolution. We identify several security issues, including traditional name system problems, as well as new issues introduced by the unique properties of ENS. We find that attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS names, a number of scam blockchain addresses and indexing of malicious websites. We further develop a new record persistence attack, to find that 22,716 .eth names (3.7\% of all names) are vulnerable to name hijacking. Our exploration suggests that our community should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of issues in decentralized name services.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is being deployed in industry, public services, and even homes. These devices are making information more available and allow for greater automation and efficiencies. With the rapid growth this industry is experiencing, the security of IoT devices has not been given the attention it needs. Many of these devices leave sensitive information exposed or may allow for malicious actors to take control of them. The Internet of Things uses a vast range of hardware which has led to many different approaches to security. Administering a network with such variability makes it easy for insecure configurations to be overlooked.This paper proposes the use of blockchain technology as the backbone to a security framework to unify IoT devices of varying resource constraints under one system. Ethereum is used to create a secure system that is Denial of Service resistant, store encryption keys, store encrypted data, and manage trust of devices. Using the Proof-of-Authority consensus method instead of the more common Proof-of-Work, allows for more efficient use of resources. This system features mechanisms to include the use of LoRa LPWAN technology, which is often used in IoT. Tests were run on a small network of devices while recording processor utilization. Latencies were also measured, showing that devices with fewer resources showed significant latencies, and suggestions as to how these latencies can be reduced are proposed.},

abstract = {Ethereum is a popular account-based blockchain whose number of accounts and transactions has skyrocketed, causing its data explosion. As a result, ordinary clients using PCs or smartphones cannot easily bootstrap as a full node, but rely on other full nodes to verify transactions, thus being exposed to security risks. The most serious overhead is caused by synchronizing the state of all accounts in the block's state trie, which takes several tens of gigabytes. Observing that more than 95\% of the accounts are dormant, we propose a novel state optimization technique, named Ethanos. Ethanos downsizes the state trie by periodically emptying it, and then re-build it only with the active accounts used in the period's transactions. Ethanos runs transactions using the accounts available in the current period's state trie as well as those available at the end of the previous period's state trie. For an account in neither of the tries, the account first restores itself by transmitting a restore transaction. One important result of this state management is that a node can now bootstrap only with the latest period's state trie, yet can fully verify all transactions thereafter. We evaluated Ethanos with real Ethereum transactions for 300,000 blocks from the 7.0 million block, with a one-week period of emptying the state trie. Our result shows that Ethanos can sharply reduce the state trie, with only a tiny fraction of the restore transactions. More importantly, unlike the Ethereum state trie which continues to grow as time goes on, the Ethanos state trie size at the end of each period is bounded by a few hundred MB, when there are more than one million, one-week-active accounts.},

We present Wide-Area Project 5 (WAP5), which aims to make these tasks easier by exposing the causal structure of communication within an application and by exposing delays that imply bottlenecks. These bottlenecks might not otherwise be obvious, with or without the application's source code. Previous research projects have presented algorithms to reconstruct application structure and the corresponding timing information from black-box message traces of local-area systems. In this paper we present (1) a new algorithm for reconstructing application structure in both local- and wide-area distributed systems, (2) an infrastructure for gathering application traces in PlanetLab, and (3) our experiences tracing and analyzing three systems: CoDeeN and Coral, two content-distribution networks in PlanetLab; and Slurpee, an enterprise-scale incident-monitoring system.},

abstract = {Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers.In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.},
