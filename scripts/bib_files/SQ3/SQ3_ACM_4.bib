abstract = {Utilizing graph analytics and learning has proven to be an effective method for exploring aspects of crypto economics such as network effects, decentralization, tokenomics, and fraud detection. However, the majority of existing research predominantly focuses on leading cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), overlooking the vast diversity among the more than 10,000 cryptocurrency projects. This oversight may result in skewed insights. In our paper, we aim to broaden the scope of investigation to encompass the entire spectrum of cryptocurrencies, examining various coins across their entire life cycles. Furthermore, we intend to pioneer advanced methodologies, including graph transfer learning and the innovative concept of "graph of graphs". By extending our research beyond the confines of BTC and ETH, our goal is to enhance the depth of our understanding of crypto economics and to advance the development of more intricate graph-based techniques.},

abstract = {This paper explores the economic implications of outsourcing data and computation to a cloud provider in comparison to maintaining an on-premise data center. Our investigation is twofold: contrasting a private data center with a trusted cloud, and the evaluation of the costs associated with securing an untrusted (e.g., honest-but-curious) cloud. We revisit prior cost models based on the current cost of CPU cycles and cryptographic operations. To evaluate the cost of securing a public cloud, we compare execution in AWS EC2 with AWS Clean Rooms, which facilitates encrypted querying. Our study offers a nuanced perspective on the economic feasibility of different cloud computing paradigms, providing essential insights for organizations contemplating the transition from local infrastructure to public cloud providers. Additionally, our analysis sheds light on the cost implications of securing against trusted insider threats, emphasizing the importance of aligning cloud computing decisions with an organization's risk tolerance and security posture. Outsourcing computation to a trusted cloud provider is economical today as cloud costs have declined since 2010, but securing against an untrusted cloud remains economically unviable despite advances in secure query processing and new cloud services.},

abstract = {As the development of Solidity smart contracts has increased in popularity, the reliance on external sources such as third-party packages increases to reduce development costs. However, despite the use of external sources bringing flexibility and efficiency to the development, they could also complicate the process of assuring the security of downstream applications due to the lack of package managers for standardized ways and sources. While previous studies have only focused on code clones without considering how the external components are introduced, the compositions of a smart contract and their characteristics still remain puzzling. To fill these gaps, we conducted an empirical study with over 350,000 Solidity smart contracts to uncover their compositions, conduct code reuse analysis, and identify prevalent development patterns. Our findings indicate that a typical smart contract comprises approximately 10 subcontracts, with over 80\% of these originating from external sources, reflecting the significant reliance on third-party packages. For self-developed subcontracts, around 50\% of the subcontracts have less than 10\% unique functions, suggesting that code reuse at the level of functions is also common. For external subcontracts, though around 35\% of the subcontracts are interfaces to provide templates for standards or protocols, an inconsistency in the use of subcontract types is also identified. Lastly, we extracted 61 frequently reused development patterns, offering valuable insights for secure and efficient smart contract development.},

In Thailand, the Department of Lands operates and facilitates the transfer of ownership and other operations related to lands. The current technology used in the operations often encounters problems with the reliability of operations and complexities that cause delays. This paper investigates a proof-of-concept (PoC) of the integration of blockchain in the land registration system to improve the reliability of storage and reduces the steps in the process. The process of loan contracts with banks is used in the PoC and an Ethereum-based private blockchain is developed and tested. Performance evaluation of our proposed system can handle at least 26 transactions per second over a range of a number of transactions of interest. The results show promising potential both in the reduction of process and the performance of blockchain for the proposed use case.},

abstract = {For the sake of enhancing repurchase rate and customer loyalty, plenty of enterprises have issued reward points. However, as there are more enterprises issuing reward points, customers become less and less interested to collect them. Even though there are companies forming a business alliance to make reward points more attractive, it is usually managed by a central leading company. In other words, there still exists a security concern for a centralized system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based cross-organizational integrated platform (BCOIP) for issuing and redeeming reward points. BCOIP provides customers an electronic reward point system that is easier to collect and manage and could circulate in many enterprises. Besides, since BCOIP deploys the smart contract to operate the reward point and make all point transactions stored on the permissioned blockchain, it provides more interoperability and security to enterprises and more credibility for costumers. Moreover, goods providers joining the BCOIP could not only improve the diversity of the reward market but also reach more costumers. Finally, we conduct two experiments to evaluate the efficiency and stability of the BCOIP. Results indicate that points transactions are stable regardless of the number of parallel processes and the other shows the number of nodes has nothing to do with the efficiency of this system.},

However, it still has limitations for datasets with frequent queries, such as the fast accumulation of privacy cost. To tackle this limitation, this paper explores the integration of a secured decentralised ledger, blockchain. Blockchain will be able to keep track of all noisy responses generated with differential privacy algorithm and allow for certain queries to reuse old responses. In this paper, a demo of a proposed blockchain-based privacy management system is designed as an interactive decentralised web application (DApp). The demo created illustrates that leveraging on blockchain will allow the total privacy cost accumulated to decrease significantly.},

abstract = {For the viability of future “mission-critical” applications such as remote surgery and connected cars, the customers must trust the network connection and operators must adhere to the Service Level Agreement (SLA). The key to enabling trust between the customer and the operator is the transparency and accountability of the SLA. That is, the operators ensure the transparent and appropriate execution of SLA clauses (e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) and compensations if the SLA is violated). In this work, we argue that today’s network is highly volatile. Therefore, it is convenient for the operators to provide service guarantees for short-term rather than traditional long-term methods. Consequently, we advocate short-term and dynamic service contracts considering spatial and temporal characteristics rather than typical long-term contracts. We propose a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-focused end-to-end transparent, accountable and automated resource provisioning system architecture in which are installed as smart contracts. In our architecture, resources can be requested and allocated dynamically and automatically with Quality-of-Service (QoS) monitoring. Our architecture is scalable through a side-channel based QoS monitoring protocol that guarantees data integrity and minimises the Permissioned Distributed Ledgers (PDL) updates. To measure the viability of our proposal, we first evaluate resource provisioning in the context of network slicing. Then we assess the DLT performance for smart contract execution, in both permissioned and permission-less settings. In the end, we evaluate the monitoring tools and compare and contrast sketches and bloomfilters, and justify our choice of bloomfilters.},

However, contemporary online sharing platforms face several challenges related to the establishment of trust among peers, as well difficulties to deal with the growing number of intermediaries (e.g., payment, insurance) needed to ensure an adequate service delivery. We designed and developed "Just Share It" (JSI), an interactive system that enables the sharing of personal physical possessions (e.g., power tools, toys, sports gear) by directly connecting lenders and borrowers, as peers, through mobile technology. The JSI system utilizes a blockchain ledger and smart contracting technologies to improve peer trust and limit the number of required intermediaries, respectively. In this submission, we briefly review emergent challenges in this space, describe the JSI prototype system and its trust model, and reflect on future architectural opportunities for an eventual "in the wild" deployment.},

But changes are afoot with new innovative digital higher-education experiences being built, shifting students' social lives further online. However, it is unclear how a longer-term shift to a digital university ecosystem will impact students and their social relations and how current technologies could amplify their social experience. We report a focus group study investigating the impact of a primarily digital university experience on the social relationships of incoming undergraduates. In line with existing research, we demonstrate how technology-mediated communications can benefit some aspects of students' social relations and less so for others. Our novel contribution is evidence of students' remarkable adaptiveness when facing an online-only university experience. Crucially, our participants identified and utilised the nuances of different online platforms to start and maintain new relationships. This way, they preserved their ability to nurture social relationships, even when dealing with an unexpected learning environment.

abstract = {Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability issue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of the chain of blocks (and of the transactions within each block). However, total order is often not fully necessary, since important advanced applications of smart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much higher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order (instead of a total order) can be exploited. In this article, we propose a novel distributed concurrent data type, Setchain, which significantly improves scalability. A Setchain implements a grow-only set whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional blockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest elements added, agreed by consensus. Therefore, two operations in the same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are ordered by their respective epoch number. We present different Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness, and report on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results show that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers, since it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total order. Since the Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying blockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many decentralized solutions with much faster operations than direct implementations on top of blockchains. Finally, we also present an algorithm that encompasses into a single process the combined behavior of the Byzantine servers, which simplifies correctness proofs by encoding the general attacker in a concrete implementation.},

year = {2019},
publisher = {IBM Corp.},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Smart contracts are software programs implemented on a blockchain platform that monitor and automate the execution of contracts to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of a contract. As such, smart contracts represent a new kind of software that poses its own engineering challenges and requires novel software engineering techniques. In particular, smart contracts require thorough testing before they are deployed because they can't be changed after deployment. This paper proposes a novel approach for executing unit tests for smart contracts intended to reduce test execution time. This reduction is achieved through the reuse of the deployment execution of the smart contract in each test and also the reuse of the setup execution of each test. We implemented the framework SolUnit that uses this approach to execute tests written in Java for Ethereum Solidity smart contracts. We also evaluated the framework SolUnit in five projects. The results show that our approach achieves a meaningful reduction of the time to execute the tests, without breaking the principle of independent tests. The experiments were performed in two environments: an in-memory simulated blockchain and a private Ethereum-based blockchain. Overall, our approach was able to reduce the test execution time by up to 70\%.},

abstract = {The blockchain-powered decentralized applications and systems have been widely deployed in recent years. The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4\% of wallets and 83.5\% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.},

abstract = {The potential of urban planning to solve environmental problems in general and manage waste, in particular, is important because the illegal dumping of solid waste is one of the events related to illegal waste treatment activities. The waste management process is very poor, especially when it comes to confirming the correct destination for the delivery of waste. In this work, we are proposing a chain-based approach to waste tracking to enable waste data reporting in a single system. The blockchain is a technology that has already proven itself in the financial sector. It securely records transactions in a large, time-stamped ledger using the proof of work algorithm (PoW), and allows us to write smart contracts on the ethereum network. The application of this technology to the waste sector will enable reliable, transparent and secure recording of all waste movements, thus enabling waste to be traced from source to treatment and disposal. Users will be able to import and export data through a user interface offering different levels of functionality and access. It will also identify and act on illegal wasteful crimes.},

abstract = {The recent success of electric vehicles leads to unprecedentedly high peaks of demand on the electric grid at the times when most people charge their cars. In order to avoid unreasonably rising costs due to inefficient utilization of the electricity infrastructure, we propose EVA: a scheduling system to solve the valley filling problem by distributing the electricity demand generated by electric vehicles in a geographically limited area efficiently over time spans in which the electric grid is underutilized. EVA is based on a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain in combination with off-chain computational nodes performing the schedule calculation using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This allows for a high degree of transparency and verifiability in the scheduling computation results while maintaining a reasonable level of efficiency. In order to interact with the scheduling system, we developed a decentralized app with a graphical frontend, where the user can enter vehicle information and future energy requirements as well as review upcoming schedules. The calculation of the schedule is performed on a daily basis, continuously providing schedules for participating users for the following day.},

abstract = {Security and privacy are primary concerns in IoT management. Security breaches in IoT resources, such as smart sensors, can leak sensitive data and compromise the privacy of individuals. Effective IoT management requires a comprehensive approach to prioritize access security and data privacy protection. Digital twins create virtual representations of IoT resources. Blockchain adds decentralization, transparency, and reliability to IoT systems. This research integrates digital twins and blockchain to manage access to IoT data streaming. Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration. The research presented in this paper enables multitenant access and customization of data streaming views and abstracts the complexity of data access management. This approach provides access and configuration security and data privacy protection.},

Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a medical record that can be accessed and have certain limitations. The challenge in implementing MR is how to be able to collect, store, and analyze patient data in a comprehensive and integrated manner without having to violate patient privacy. The implementation of MR is how to transmit data between hospitals. To solve the problems and issues faced in implementing MR, there is a technology that can overcome this, one of which is using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that managed by many participants in an availability manner. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that anyone can use to create and deploy decentralized applications that run on the blockchain network. The data stored on the Ethereum blockchain will always be there and can be seen as long as the blockchain network is still online. With ethereum, the process of sharing data will be easy to do using a computer belonging to the hospital as a blockchain node. The result of implementing blockchain into medical record is now the data can be shared securely between hospitals.},

abstract = {Agriculture is the lifeline of Indian economy which contributes to 22\% of the GDP, provides 58\% employment, and sustains 69\% of the population. However, agricultural production comes with various risk factors beyond human control. Farmers are highly exposed to risk and it is aggravated by the limited span of risk mitigation instruments such as insurance where there is a lack of participation from the private sector and the claim payout procedure is very lengthy, due to which the farmer cannot initiate new cropping activity or it is delayed. There is no proper and adequate provision of security for crops grown by Indian farmers and despite increasing vulnerability, they have not yet fully developed the capacity to mitigate risk effectively. There is a need to design innovative insurance products to balance the interests of the insurer as well as the insured. With the Prime Minister's call to be "self sufficient" or "aatmanirbhar", in this paper we present a decentralised peer-to-peer crop insurance framework which enables to overcome the current disadvantages by securing farmers' interests, eliminating intermediaries and providing a secure, standardized, and transparent system that does not hinder any information from stakeholders. Through blockchain technology, the system promotes trust in a trust less environment wherein the farmers and the private investors go into a contract. The investors pool their investments and provide cover for the farmers, thus help the nation become self sufficient and help the farmers prosper.},

abstract = {Blockchain databases are storage systems that combine properties of blockchains and databases like decentralization, tamperproofness, low query latency and support for complex queries. Blockchain databases are an emerging and important class of blockchain technology that is critical to the development of non-trivial smart contracts, distributed applications and decentralized marketplaces.In this work, we consider the problem of designing end-to-end encrypted blockchain databases to support the development of decentralized applications that need to store and query sensitive data. In particular, we show how to design what we call blockchain encrypted multi-maps (EMM) which can be used to instantiate various kinds of NoSQL blockchain databases like key-value stores or document databases. We propose three blockchain EMM constructions, each of which achieves different tradeoffs between query, add and delete efficiency. All of our constructions are legacy-friendly in the sense that they can be implemented on top of any existing blockchain. This is particularly challenging since blockchains do not support data deletion.We implemented our schemes on the Algorand blockchain and evaluated their concrete efficiency empirically. Our experiments show that they are practical.},

abstract = {The Ph.D. proposal addresses the complexity of building distributed applications and systems with Application Servers and Web Services middleware, respectively. Despite their flexible XML-based configuration, taming the ever growing complexity remains all but an easy task. To remedy such problems, the thesis proposes an ontology-based approach to support the management (i.e. development and administration) of Application Server and Web Services based applications. The ontology captures properties of, relationships between and behaviors of the components and services that are required for management purposes. The ontology is an explicit conceptual model with formal logic-based semantics. Therefore its descriptions of components and services may be queried, may foresight required actions, or may be checked to avoid inconsistent system configurations --- during development as well as during run time. Thus, the ontology-based approach retains the original flexibility, but it adds new capabilities for the developer and user of the system.},
