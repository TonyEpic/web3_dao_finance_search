abstract = {Drug traceability is currently a very challenging area given the complexity of several issues, including drug quality and counterfeit medications. The counterfeited drugs have a major impact on human life, treatment outcomes and economic burden. To deal with these issues, we propose a semantic blockchain-based system for drug traceability that aims at detecting counterfeit drugs in order to improve the patients’ safety and quality of life as well as eliminating manufacturers’ potential loss and increasing their revenue. Our proposal is based on blockchain and semantic web technologies to enhance the representation capability of data in the pharmaceutical supply chain.},

abstract = {As in any institution, universities have processes defined in an unique way, involving many verification steps. Issuance of end-of-course certificates require multiple signatures from authorities, instructors and in some cases administrative staff. After an initial work of single signature certificates using blockchain for education purposes, we generate a prototype including more than one signature over the infrastructure generated for the Smart Ecosystem for Learning and Inclusion or SELI project. This prototype records certificates in a private non-monetary blockchain network, and is provided as an open source project. Countries like Ecuador, Turkey, Uruguay, and Finland can share certificates from the SELI platform through local nodes. This article provides relevant details about the implementation of the system, always with the aim of re-use existing software to reduce implementation time.},

abstract = {The process of data interaction is often criticized by the public for data privacy leakage, attribution disputes, as well as being maliciously tampered with and difficult to trace the source of data. This paper proposes a data privacy protection and fingerprint tracing method based on the features of decentralization, traceability and non-tampering in blockchain technology. And we combined with the protection of data by secure network platform in trusted computing and differential-traceability algorithm (DTA). We propose a data privacy protection and fingerprint traceability method, and use the SkipList table index structure to improve interaction efficiency. We discuss the proposed data fingerprint-based traceability framework model in a trusted environment using the features of blockchain and trusted computing platforms. In this paper, the data can be processed safely and efficiently to solve the privacy problem, the transaction data is encrypted and recorded on the chain by DTA, and the interaction process uses the SkipList table index to enhance retrieval efficiency. Finally, through multiple experiments and comparison of the results obtained from security testing, it is verified that the blockchain-trusted computing data privacy protection and data fingerprint traceability SkipList table indexing method can achieve traceability for data privacy protection, transaction security management and peer-to-peer verification of encryption and decryption algorithms. We not only provide a secure, trustworthy and efficient data privacy protection model, but also bring a time efficiency optimization of 6ms per 10,000 queries.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions among users  
on top of a peer-to-peer network. Among all, Ethereum is the most popular  
general-purpose platform and its support of smart contracts led to a new  
form of applications called decentralized applications (DApps). A typical  
DApp has an off-chain frontend and on-chain backend architecture, and the  
frontend often needs interactions with the backend network, e.g., to  
acquire chain data or make transactions. Therefore, Ethereum nodes implement  
the official RPC specification and expose a uniform set of RPC methods to  
the frontend. However, the specification is not sufficient in two points:  
(1) lack of clarification for non-deterministic event handling, and  
(2) lack of specification for invalid arguments. To effectively disclose  
any deviations caused by the insufficiency, this paper introduces  
EtherDiffer that automatically performs differential testing on four major  
node implementations in terms of their RPC services. EtherDiffer first  
generates a non-deterministic chain by multi-concurrent transactions and  
propagation delay. Then, it applies our key techniques called  
property-based generation and type-preserving mutation to generate  
both semantically-valid and semantically-invalid-yet-executable test  
cases. EtherDiffer executes the test cases on target nodes and reports  
any deviations in error handling or return values. The evaluation showed  
the effectiveness of our test case generation techniques with the success  
ratios of 98.8\% and 95.4\%, respectively. Also, EtherDiffer detected  
48 different classes of deviations including 11 implementation bugs  
such as crash and denial-of-service bugs. We reported 44 of the detected  
classes to the specification and node developers and received  
acknowledgements as well as bug patches. Lastly, it significantly  
outperformed the official node testing tool in every technical aspect.  
We believe that our research findings can contribute to more stable  
DApp ecosystem by reducing the inconsistencies among nodes.},

It records mileage and GPS data of cars and secures that on the blockchain, which strongly hinders odometer fraud. Our users own and control their data while at the same time data integrity is ensured. This facilitates the certification of that data. We discuss the advantages of this approach compared to current systems and also highlight limitations of our architecture and the use of blockchain technology.},

abstract = {The publish and subscribe messaging model has proven itself as a dominant messaging paradigm for IoT systems. An example of such is the commonly used Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, the security concerns with this protocol have presented vital security challenges in most IoT applications. For example, the MQTT protocol does not have secure authentication mechanisms implemented and leaves that task to the developer as all the included native security services are fragile. This paper will present a well-thought approach involving a lightweight authentication and authorization scheme together with a decentralized identity system to manage the users' identities. This mechanism helps in facilitating the authentication for both subscribers and publishers by utilizing a smart contract in Ethereum blockchain to guarantee trust, accountability and preserve user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to prove our work, which involves a decentralized MQTT platform and dashboard using our approach. The usability of this approach was further analyzed, particularly concerning CPU and memory utilization. Our analysis proved that our approach satisfies IoT applications' requirements since it reduces the consumption of resources and that smart contracts help in the automation of data management processes.},

abstract = {Decentralized and distributed blockchain technology has superior potential. Quorum, as a permissioned blockchain platform, provides enhanced privacy and performance that are suitable for enterprise needs. Cloud, as the infrastructure for Quorum-based blockchain, is vulnerable to failures. Failures originating from errors need to be tolerated through improved reliability and fault-tolerance procedures. Fault-tolerance and reliability are still challenging to implement in cloud infrastructure for Quorum-based blockchain networks. This research focuses on implementing fault-tolerance mechanisms in the provisioning of Quorum-based blockchain in a cloud environment. The research explores the use of hybrid fault tolerance by adopting a combination of reactive protocol, namely replication, and proactive protocol, namely monitoring. The replication protocol creates data redundancy with reactive treatment performed in case of failures, ensuring data availability even in failure conditions. The monitoring protocol provides real-time monitoring of the blockchain network's condition and performance, enabling proactive detection and mitigation of system failures. Overall, this research utilizes automation in its operational processes. It employs tools such as Amazon Web Services, Quorum, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and Truffle. The research design and implementation are divided into cloud infrastructure, blockchain network, and interface. The research testing results demonstrate that the system infrastructure is capable of achieving fault tolerance using replication and monitoring protocols, as well as making transactions within the blockchain network.},

abstract = {Many IoT devices lack memory and computational complexities of modern computing devices, making them vulnerable to a wide range of cyber attacks. Among these, DDoS attacks are a growing concern in IoT. Such attacks are executed through the introduction of rogue devices and then using them and/or other compromised devices to facilitate DDoS attacks by generating relentless traffic. This paper aims to address DDoS security issues in IoT by proposing an integration of IoT devices with blockchain. This paper uses Ethereum, a blockchain variant, with smart contracts to replace the traditional centralized IoT infrastructure with a decentralized one. IoT devices are then required to access the network using smart contracts. The integration of IoT with Ethereum not only prevents rogue devices from gaining access to the server but also addresses DDoS attacks by using static resource allocation for devices.},

It serves as a trust intermediary in several industries, including finance, insurance, and supply chain management, in the blockchain 2.0 era. With the increasing interest in smart contracts, security has become a serious problem. Examining typical vulnerability types and vulnerability detection methodologies is of special importance. In this research, a comprehensive evaluation of common smart contract security vulnerabilities is conducted, and a three-tier threat model is then provided to classify the vulnerabilities. In addition, we examine fourteen existing smart contract analysis tools for finding vulnerabilities and classify them according to the main technique they apply. This paper is designed to serve as a reference for people who wish to analyse deployed code and enhance existing detection techniques. At the conclusion, open issues and future research paths regarding smart contract vulnerability detection are presented.},

abstract = {The advent of metaverse platforms has caused a revolution in the way people interact and engage with digital content creation and consumption. These platforms employ advanced technologies like blockchain and augmented reality to provide users with a fully decentralized environment. Among the metaverse platforms, Decentraland stands out as a popular blockchain-based virtual reality platform that enables users to monetize their content creation. However, a major criticism of these platforms is the low number of active users. Existing methodologies for measuring user traffic and engagement in these metaverse platforms are often unclear and inconsistent, and recent analyses do not provide a correct evaluation of the active users. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating user traffic on decentralized metaverse platforms. Our approach employs a traffic monitor that links traffic with transactions to analyze user behavior. Decentraland has been used as a case study due to its decentralized nature and transparent provision of information about user traffic. The study includes an analysis of user behavior using graph analysis, as well as an examination of user traffic and transactions. We use user traffic to measure community engagement and economic activity, and we assess value exchange through parcel transaction prices. Our analysis indicates a lower average node degree in the interaction graph compared to traditional social media, no correlation between user traffic and parcel transaction prices, the exhibition of patterns of close proximity between the dates of traffic and transactions, and the presence of four distinct user clusters based on travel patterns, with the finding that a small proportion of highly engaged users contribute significantly to the total distance travelled. This study is the first to focus on user traffic and transaction activity within a metaverse platform, and the proposed methodology can be adapted for use on comparable metaverse platforms as well.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed growing consolidation of web operations. For example, the majority of web traffic now originates from a few organizations, and even micro-websites often choose to host on large pre-existing cloud infrastructures. In response to this, the "Decentralized Web" attempts to distribute ownership and operation of web services more evenly. This paper describes the design and implementation of the largest and most widely used Decentralized Web platform --- the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) --- an open-source, content-addressable peer-to-peer network that provides distributed data storage and delivery. IPFS has millions of daily content retrievals and already underpins dozens of third-party applications. This paper evaluates the performance of IPFS by introducing a set of measurement methodologies that allow us to uncover the characteristics of peers in the IPFS network. We reveal presence in more than 2700 Autonomous Systems and 152 countries, the majority of which operate outside large central cloud providers like Amazon or Azure. We further evaluate IPFS performance, showing that both publication and retrieval delays are acceptable for a wide range of use cases. Finally, we share our datasets, experiences and lessons learned.},

abstract = {Key management has long remained a difficult unsolved problem in the field of usable security. While password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) are widely used to solve this problem in centralized applications, their low entropy and lack of a recovery mechanism make them unsuitable for use in decentralized contexts. The multi-factor key derivation function (MFKDF) is a recently proposed cryptographic primitive that aims to address these deficiencies by incorporating commonly used authentication factors into the key derivation process. In this paper, we implement an MFKDF-based Ethereum wallet and perform a user study with 27 participants to directly compare its usability against traditional cryptocurrency wallet architectures. Our results show that MFKDF-based applications outperform conventional key management approaches on both subjective and objective metrics, with a 37\% higher average SUS score (p &lt; 0.0001) and 71\% faster task completion times (p &lt; 0.0001) for the MFKDF-based wallet.},

abstract = {Recent blockchain-based systems for managing credentials show advantages over paper-based procedures. However, issuing credentials with blockchain could conflict with current management rules and policies. One of the possible conflicts is the auditability. Most blockchain-based systems for credentials focus on security, efficiency and privacy while ignoring the auditability of the system. In this paper, we propose a new system IU-TransCert for issuing, verifying, and auditing academic credentials. The system uses a new data structure named the Auditable Merkle Tree that enables credential issuance and built-in auditing capabilities. The auditable data fields can be customized to meet regulations. Credentials are published to the blockchain in the root node of the Auditable Merkle Tree, allowing access for auditors while preserving privacy. The system provides automated and transparent auditing processes for educational authorities to independently verify credentials without involving issuers. We also present a prototype to demonstrate feasibility, and a security analysis to examine protections against threats. The analysis and discussion shows that the proposed system could enhance credential privacy, efficiency, integrity, and auditability across the university ecosystem.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) became part of everyday life for many people around the world. They are one of the main channels through which information can spread at lightning speed. Thanks to this fact, people use them for the most disparate reasons, such as sources of information in place of newspapers, to receive emotional or technical support, or to share their ideas and opinions to satisfy their need for sociality.Since their introduction, people questioned these services because they are affected by several problems. These problems include the preservation of the users' privacy, fake news diffusion, diffusion of illegal pieces of content, censorship vs free speech, economic value redistribution, security vs trust, and so on. The aim of this workshop is to partially try to overcome these problems by setting up a platform for researchers to publish their contributions.The contributions can point to innovative methods and algorithms for social graph mining, which can be helpful to develop more efficient information diffusion techniques; the problem of privacy, and how can be enforced in these systems is current, and in particular the relation between security, trust and privacy is crucial in the scenario of OSNs; the decentralisation and its impact on the implementation of social services; how Artificial Intelligence techniques that respect the privacy of the users can be implemented; technologies that enable the metaverse.},

It is often challenging to find a suitable donor in case of emergency. The situation is worse if it is a rare blood group. This paper introduces a blockchain-based decentralised application (DApp) to match recipients with blood donors during an emergency. Personal information such as name, location, blood group, and donation history is stored securely in the blockchain distributed ledger through IPFS. The donors' lack of awareness and motivation are the primary reasons for people not coming forward for blood donations. We propose to gamify the blood donation process by issuing NFT badges as a reward for donors. This paper explains the design of smart contracts for storing donor and recipient data on the ledger and issuing NFTs to donors. The article also briefly discusses the process of designing the DApp.},

abstract = {Sophisticated mass attacks, especially when exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, have the potential to cause destructive damage to organizations and critical infrastructure. To timely detect and contain such attacks, collaboration among the defenders is critical. By correlating real-time detection information (threat indicators) from multiple sources, defenders can detect attacks and take the appropriate measures in time. However, although the technical tools to facilitate collaboration exist, real-world adoption of such collaborative security mechanisms is still underwhelming. This is largely due to a lack of trust and participation incentives for companies and organizations. This paper proposes TRIDEnT, a novel collaborative platform that aims to enable parties to exchange network threat indicators, thus increasing their overall detection capabilities. TRIDEnT allows parties that may be in a competitive relationship, to selectively advertise, sell and acquire threat indicators in the form of (near) real-time peer-to-peer streams. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we instantiate our design in a decentralized manner using Ethereum smart contracts and provide a fully functional prototype.},

abstract = {This article discusses secure methods to conduct e-voting over a blockchain in three different settings: decentralized voting, centralized remote voting, and centralized polling station voting. These settings cover almost all voting scenarios that occur in practice. A proof-of-concept implementation for decentralized voting over Ethereum’s blockchain is presented. This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

abstract = {The novel blockchain generation of Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) protocols focuses on scalability and performance to meet the requirements of distributed ledger technology (DLT), e.g., decentralization and geographic dispersion. Validating scalability and performance of BFT protocol implementations requires careful evaluation. While experiments with real protocol deployments usually offer the best realism, they are costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore simulation of unmodified BFT protocol implementations as a method for cheap and rapid protocol evaluation: We can accurately forecast the performance of a BFT protocol while experimentally scaling its environment, i.e., by varying the number of nodes or geographic dispersion. Our approach is resource-friendly and preserves application-realism, since existing BFT frameworks can be simply plugged into the simulation engine without requiring code modifications or re-implementation.},

abstract = {The increasing adoption of Web services is one of the most important technological trends in contemporary business organizations. This trend is motivated by claims about the ability of Web services to facilitate information technology (IT) flexibility, improve information management, and even lead to a competitive advantage. However, as the move towards Web services is gaining momentum, research about their organizational consequences remains mostly conceptual. This exploratory study empirically investigates whether the implementation of Web services applications is associated with these technological, informational, and strategic impacts. A field study approach is employed to collect cross-sectional data from 293 IT managers in Israel. Data analysis generally supports the research hypotheses, showing that the implementation of Web services applications positively affects the flexibility of IT infrastructure resources and information flexibility. The results also show that a specific implementation -- an Enterprise Information Portal -- also has positive effects on the flexibility of IT infrastructure capabilities, information quality, and IT-based competitive advantage. Finally, the results demonstrate the magnitude of the organizational impacts of Web services applications by comparing them to those of non-Web ERP systems. The implications of the findings for practice and research are discussed},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of IoT devices makes the delivery mechanism of security updates a challenge. Current IoT systems rely on centralized or brokered paradigms or clouds with huge computational and storage capacities. The existing centralized IoT setups are therefore expensive as the result of factors such as the high costs associated with cloud server and network infrastructures and maintenance. Thus, the need for a fully decentralized peer to peer and secure technology to overcome these problems rises into the realm of existence. Blockchain provides a solution that fulfills the requirements of such a platform. Ideally, the update infrastructure should implement the CIA triad properties (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). In this article, we study how a blockchain application can meet these requirements and propose a novel system to decentrally distribute digital content in a peer-to-peer network using the blockchain technology and smart contracts to overcome the concerns mentioned above. Additionally, in order to prevent the issues stemming from the free-riding challenge in P2P networks (peers refrain to generously share their resources to distribute updates), we exploit a Nash equilibrium micropayment mechanism to grant adequate incentive for peers to participate in distributing IoT update files.},
