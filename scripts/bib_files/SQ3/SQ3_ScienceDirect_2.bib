abstract = {This study empirically investigates the factors impacting internet banking (IB) usage by Turkish bank customers. A unique internet banking usage model (IBUM) was developed and validated. The initial proposed model incorporated 10 factors named usefulness, ease of use, control, social influence, compatibility, risk, website features, alliance service, awareness of service and personalization that affect internet banking usage. The initial model was tested against both measurement and structural models. The results of initial model testing indicated that compatibility has the most significant effect on internet banking usage which is then followed by alliance service, usefulness, personalization and ease of use. Consequently, the initial model was modified in order to find the inter-relationships among factors. The final IBUM consists of 7 factors which are able to explain 65% of the variance in internet banking usage. Finally, the results are discussed and suggestions for future researches presented by highlighting the effects of personalization and alliance services.}

abstract = {With the progressive increase in the use of disruptive technology in healthcare services, diversified solutions are being worked upon to make medical services patient-friendly and secure. In general, patient personal details and medical history are rigorously maintained in electronic health records. The data are sensitive and must be secured. Often data must be shared to obtain a second expert opinion and alternative solutions. This potentially increases data exposure, thereby risking breaches and unauthorized access. The blockchain architecture has immense potential to securely communicate and transform health, clinical, medical, and life science service delivery as required by healthcare applications in an immutable and decentralized manner. Blockchain innovation has caught the interest of health experts and biomedical researchers in different areas of medical care such as longitudinal clinical records, drug advancement, automated complaints, interoperability in people’s health, clinical exploration, patient portals, information security, and supply chain management system. It is being considered whether blockchain-integrated healthcare will disturb the flow of medical services. Still, medical associations are keenly observing its potential for ideas such as secure patient identification. Blockchain with features such as decentralized networks and tamper-proof platforms makes it an ideal technology to be investigated for its prospects in healthcare. This chapter provides an in-depth examination of the different intricacies of the blockchain in the healthcare sector, particularly with the 4.0 edition. The chapter also presents various techniques for secured transaction and validation methods of healthcare data that are evolving rapidly. Factors enhancing patient interoperability with the blockchain structure focusing on state-of-the-art security and privacy aspects have been addressed in the work. In addition, the work also presents a case study with already-existing electronic healthcare support application with online assistance and data accumulation at a cloud-based service to reduce the physical work done by patients, work also enumerates open issues, and challenges with the technology suggested.}

abstract = {The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.}

The safe and effective collection, transmission, and accessibility of electronic health records (EHRs) using modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) is essential for realizing the goals of eHealth. However, the use of EHRs by healthcare practitioners creates the risk of data breaches and jeopardizes patient confidentiality. Fortunately, smart contracts and blockchain technology offer effective EHR access control techniques that can enable secure client identification, authentication, and authorization, enhancing the security of EHRs.So, this paper brings effective Blockchain-based solutions using Hyperledger fabric for providing privacy to EHRs. An effective deployment architecture and chain code were generated for design and access control. In this case, the utilization of Hyperledger Fabric as the Blockchain technology introduces a new consensus mechanism, enabling efficient scalability and safeguarding anonymity. By employing Hyperledger Fabric for framework development, the system achieves its objectives. Experimental results are carried out for analyzing the system performance and also computational tests.}

There is a research gap where entrepreneurship is relatively little researched in the context of trust. Mainstream trust research overlooks entrepreneurship and its special features of placing uncertainty at the heart of its operation, in particular in the information, communication and high technology sector, and therefore among startups. The above results from the still weak research invention regarding the issues of managing these enterprises. Meanwhile, this is an area particularly predestined for research on trust. Therefore, the aim of the article is to try to answer the question about importance and the ways of building trust from the point of view of startup owners. Author used critical review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews to carried out the research in startups implementing foreign expansion outside of Poland. The presented study is part of a wider project, including interviews with leaders of other technology companies, as well as with other employees of selected departments of these companies. This article presents the results of the study of the one of group of leaders who are owners of startups, implementing foreign expansion. The conclusions drawn from the analysis confirm that the challenges underlying the foreign expansion of startups are not only technical, financial, legal or related to tax, etc. but they should be rooted and related to the need to take into account the specificity of the organizational culture of companies in their activities. The conducted research showed a high level of leaders' awareness of the need to build collective trust between employees in the company, but there is a need for systemic development at the institutional level regarding methods and tools that can be used in this regard. The key issue here is the growing importance of the organizational culture of trust built and developed by leaders, based on values. Therefore, the problem of managing startups in this context seems important, so that they can dynamically develop and grow.}

abstract = {The traditional process of patent registration and trading is very complex, often hindered by challenges related to information security and patent traceability. As a popular emergent technology, blockchain has several useful characteristics such as tamper proof, distributed data management, timestamp, asymmetric encryption, and smart contract. Built upon these characteristics, this paper develops a patent registration and trading system for improved information security, immutability, transparency, and traceability. This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process. Through these comparisons we show that the proposed blockchain-aided patent registration and trading system is effective in resolving several key patent protection challenges. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed to highlight the significance of our proposed method.}

abstract = {We consider a real-world problem faced in some blockchain ecosystems that select their active validators—the actors that maintain the blockchain—from a larger set of candidates through an election-based mechanism. Specifically, we focus on Polkadot, a protocol that aggregates preference lists from another set of actors, nominators, that contain a limited number of trusted validators and thereby influence the election’s outcome. This process is financially incentivized but often overwhelms human decision makers due to the problem’s complexity and the multitude of available alternatives. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) to help the nominators choose the validators in an environment with frequently changing data. The system structures the relevant multiple attribute problem and incorporates a dedicated active learning algorithm. Its goal is to find a sufficiently small set of pairwise elicitation questions to infer nominators’ preferences. We test the proposed solution in an experiment with 115 real nominators from the Polkadot ecosystem. The empirical results confirm that our approach outperforms the unaided process in terms of required interaction time, imposed cognitive effort, and offered efficacy. The developed DSS can be easily extended to other blockchain ecosystems.}

DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.}

This chapter constitutes a comparative study of Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, specifically their “Clients Types,” “Transactions,” and “Networks”. It start from explaining Bitcoin reference client, also known as satoshi client, and Bitcoin core client specifications. Information about the Bitcoin network status is obtained by Bitcoin core client for, e.g., version, protocol version, and wallet version, etc., while Ethereum clients are software which implements Ethereum specification and make communication with other peers in Ethereum network, there are two types of clients in Ethereum: full node and remote client, such as parity and geth. Explanation moves further for Bitcoin transactions, their status that is spent or unspent, and their keys used in transactions for Bitcoins. In Bitcoin it is also required to cryptographically secure random number generator for creating private keys. Ethereum transactions are also cryptographically signed messages, but in contrast with Bitcoin, transactions only can trigger a change of state of singleton blockchain or can causes a smart contract to execute. This chapter will be useful for detailed information and technical differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum platforms.}

By considering the perspectives of the different involved stakeholders, the paper specifically addresses the call for more research about blockchain-based services which adopts a human-centred approach instead of technocentric. The paper is based on the empirical analysis of a DApp called BBBlockchain which was specifically created with the purpose to improve citizens participation in urban planning decisions in two major residential development projects in Berlin, Germany. BBBlockchain is a proof of concept which is currently running on its own in-house test network but it can run on every EVM compatible blockchain. From the analysis of the information layer of participation, it can be argued that the most important values include transparency, inclusiveness and confidentiality.}

While an increasing number of pilot projects have been exploring DeFi applications for use by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in various finance scenarios, there is not yet a real-world adoption of DeFi beyond these projects to unlock their potential for progressing the digitisation of supply chain finance (SCF). This paper reports on a university-industry collaborative study to leverage the use of blockchain-based DeFi technology in two ways: (i) to benefit SMEs by reducing their cost of finance and increasing ease of access to funding, and; (ii) to address the prevalent asymmetric information risks and costs in a supply chain finance context. The research informed the design and development of a DeFi architecture for asset tracking in agricultural supply chains implemented and evaluated in a real-world pilot adoption with a producer in the Australian livestock industry. The use case shows that there are numerous risks pertaining to the adoption of DeFi for SCF. In response, the paper suggests new ways for supply chain SMEs to secure benefits from their investment in DeFi based on the key findings derived from evaluating our use cases.}

While some solutions already address traceability issues in supply chain management and manufacturing, customized and volatile industries, in which each product features a unique configuration, are still lacking appropriate models and proofs of concept. In this research, we develop a decentralized blockchain application called TokenTrail, which focuses on the specific traceability requirements of multi-hierarchical assembly structures. The proposed blockchain architecture is based on a consortium Ethereum network and a Proof of Authority consensus, which delivers a trusted and shared database within an economic processing framework. To overcome the challenges of managing liaison transformations, we develop an assembly token manager based on the semi-fungible ERC 1155 token, which enables a direct representation of complex assembly processes and structures containing unique parts and batches within one smart contract. A user-friendly front-end application simplifies the querying of the recorded traceability data and visualizes existing dependencies.}

abstract = {Blockchain is a promising information technology which can provide several potential applications related to operations and supply chains. By using distributed software architecture and advanced computing, blockchain can solve the problem of immutable ledgers distributed to several actors in the chain. This paper reviews blockchain technology and outlines possible uses for immutable distributed ledgers in operations and supply chains. A classification of the applications of blockchain technology in the scope of operations and supply chain management is presented. In order to demonstrate the technical architecture of the blockchain-based logistics monitoring system (BLMS), a reference implementation was programmed and tested based on Ethereum. The purpose of the BLMS is to provide a solution for parcel tracking in a supply chain to support an open and immutable history record for each transaction. The functionality of the system consists of transaction entry for logistics operators. The presented reference architecture demonstrates how blockchain can be implemented in the operations and supply chain context by using software components.}

abstract = {Digital Twins are complex digital representations of assets that are used by a variety of organizations across the Industry 4.0 value chain. As the digitization of industrial processes advances, Digital Twins will become widespread. As a result, there is a need to develop new secure data sharing models for a complex ecosystem of interacting Digital Twins and lifecycle parties. Decentralized Applications are uniquely suited to address these sharing challenges while ensuring availability, integrity and confidentiality. They rely on distributed ledgers and decentralized databases for data storage and processing, avoiding single points of trust. To tackle the need for decentralized sharing of Digital Twin data, this work proposes an owner-centric decentralized sharing model. A formal access control model addresses integrity and confidentiality aspects based on Digital Twin components and lifecycle requirements. With our prototypical implementation EtherTwin we show how to overcome the numerous implementation challenges associated with fully decentralized data sharing, enabling management of Digital Twin components and their associated information. For validation, the prototype is evaluated based on an industry use case and semi-structured expert interviews.}

abstract = {In peer-to-peer computing networks, Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols are a popular solution to ensure the consistency security in the presence of some malicious nodes, thus are widely employed in blockchain systems. However, BFT protocols still face various security threats in practice. Currently, testing the security of BFT protocols often requires manual operations. I.e., it lacks comprehensive automation testing techniques. This makes it difficult to cover various scenarios of malicious node behaviors. Therefore, it is an urgent requirement to design an automated testing framework that can comprehensively and efficiently evaluate the security of BFT protocols. This paper proposes BFTDiagnosis, an automated security testing framework with malicious behavior injection for BFT protocols. The framework can automatically configure and initiate protocol testing tasks, and construct consensus nodes to execute different BFT protocols. During testing, consensus nodes can inject malicious behaviors based on pattern matching strategies and malicious behavior triggering mechanisms to simulate various malicious scenarios. Through an Analyzer, BFTDiagnosis can collect protocol runtime data from consensus nodes and calculate four security quantification indicators to evaluate protocol performance. We conducted a load consumption evaluation of BFTDiagnosis. The results indicate its acceptable performance. Additionally, we tested PBFT, Basic-HotStuff, and Chained-HotStuff protocols using the BFTDiagnosis framework, validating the effectiveness of the framework and the rationality of security quantification indicators. Finally, we compared it with nine related technologies and found that BFTDiagnosis is good at testing scenario comprehensiveness and fault localization capability, and can intuitively evaluate the security of BFT protocols through four quantification indicators. The above results show that BFTDiagnosis is an effective and comprehensive security testing framework for BFT protocols.}

It has been anticipated as a key enabler for various domains of applications such as health care, automotive, agriculture, industrial operations, automation, energy, and the next generation of living. However, the current IoT applications face significant challenges in terms of the huge amount of collected data, intensive data exchange, security, privacy, centralized processing, and interoperability. To mitigate many of these issues, blockchain has been identified as a promising innovative technology. Blockchain, in conjunction with smart contracts, has received significant attention both from the industry and academia and offers features such as irreversibility, non-repudiation, proof of provenance, fault tolerance, pseudonymity, decentralized operations and decision-making, and distributed ledger. The integration of blockchain with IoT requires essential insights concerning the application areas, scalability, security, privacy, data college and storage, performance, and governance. Thus, this paper intends to expound on the opportunities and key aspects of using blockchain in the IoT landscape. Specifically, this paper surveys the utilization of blockchain for various IoT applications. Besides, the paper distinguishes different technical aspects and presents the associated research challenges. At last, future research directions are discussed depending on the lessons learned.}

Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.}

However, the framework devoted to risk/threat assessments has also been highlighted, as there is a substantial need to strengthen the systems architecture to be more proactive.

A large inflow of newcomers or inexperienced investors can serve as a trigger of herding. Herding in the NFT market tends to arise when the return on Ethereum increases, but it tends to diminish as the return on Bitcoin increases. Meanwhile, unlike in traditional asset markets, herding in NFT markets does not appear to happen across submarkets (OpenSea, Atomic, Cryptokitties, Godsunchained, and Decentraland). Active investors herd to trade NFTs within different collections and follow the market consensus when they are making investment decisions on NFTs listed on OpenSea. Results from macro- and micro-approaches validate and complement one another, plotting a profile on how investors herd in the NFT market.}

This paper uses Blockchain technology to develop a system where customers can validate a product legitimacy without the need of a corresponding merchant. This system will be able to be used by manufacturers and companies to ensure that their products will be harder to counterfeit, therefore they will gain more trust from customers. The Ethereum blockchain is used to build the proposed model that is capable of tracing every item's creation and transactions, ensuring the credibility of an item's genuineness.

However, IoT suffers from many limitations like energy, resource constraints, scalability, security, availability, etc. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another similar technology that has many features that are capable of solving many of the limitations of the conventional IoT system. So, suitably incorporating SDN technology into the conventional IoT system, an improved version of IoT namely an SDN-based IoT network system has been evolved. This system is capable of resolving many of the limitations of IoT. Since this newer SDN-based IoT version is enriched with better energy and resources, it can undertake higher computational loads to resolve security issues. In the security domain, Blockchain is a state-of-the-art security-based technology in recent times which has already been implemented in the fields of cryptocurrency effectively. So, Many research opportunities emerge out in adapting Blockchain-based technology suitable for the SDN-based IoT Networking domain. This paper deals with the investigations carried out by the past researchers on various security aspects of the IoT, SDN, and SDN-based IoT systems and their solutions using various technologies, including that of Blockchain. It was concluded that the convergence of Blockchain in IoT and SDN and its combination (SDN-based IoT) resolved many security issues. Many prominent research gaps still persist here to be resolved.

Despite the benefits that IoT technology brings to individuals, society, and industry, this technology faces a critical challenge in controlling access to various resources in IoT environments. To address this challenge, we propose Combo-Chain, an blockchain-based access control system deeply rooted in the concepts of the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model, smart contracts, and sharding. Combo-Chain introduces the concept of hierarchy for both subject attributes and object attributes to enhance flexibility and dynamicity when specifying ABAC policies, simplifying policy and attribute management. It not only manages access policies but also attributes by deploying a set of smart contracts. Furthermore, Combo-Chain utilizes sharding technique to distribute the overhead associated with storing and managing both access policies and attributes. Sharding also helps Combo-Chain to distribute the computational overhead when evaluating access requests among two groups of nodes, addressing the issues of low scalability and poor performance often associated with blockchain technology. Combo-Chain is implemented on a private Ethereum platform, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Combo-Chain compared to existing blockchain-based access control systems.}

The well-defined structural hierarchy of managing organizations in a smart city face several data management issues. The integration of emerging technologies, such as (IoT), has introduced more complexity to data maintenance in the smart city. At present, cloud-based information systems have become the norm for managing IoT data. Due to the centralized administrative control, the cloud-based information management is untrusted. Hence, it fails to guarantee the integrity of IoT data and traceability of operations to achieve transparency within the smart city organizations. Adoption of blockchain-based information systems can be viable solution to address these challenges. However, it introduces a new challenge of interoperability of transactions among different smart city organizations. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized hierarchy of blockchains, named Blockchain-of-Blockchains (BoBs), for ensuring data integrity and blockchain interoperability at the same time. We implement the proposed concept using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethermint as a proof-of-concept for evaluating the performance of the proposed concept.}

However, its integration with the supply chain model is still constrained by substantial scalability and security issues. So, the current blockchain technology with traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus is incompatible with the next-generation vaccine supply chain framework. This paper introduces a model named “VaccineChain” - a novel checkpoint-assisted scalable blockchain based secure vaccine supply chain. VaccineChain guarantees the complete integrity and immutability of vaccine supply records to combat counterfeited vaccines over the supply chain. The dynamic consensus algorithm with various validating difficulty levels supports the efficient scalability of VaccineChain. Moreover, VaccineChain includes anonymous authentication among entities to provide selective revocation. This work also consists of a use case example of a secure vaccine supply chain using checkpoint assisted scalable blockchain with customized transaction generation-rule and smart contracts to demonstrate the application of VaccineChain. The comprehensive security analysis with standard theoretical proofs ensures the computational infeasibility of VaccineChain. Further, the detailed performance analysis with test simulations shows the practicability of VaccineChain.}

However, to fully capitalize on DT’s potential, we need robust and scalable frontend solutions. This study proposes an innovative approach to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic frontend frameworks by leveraging micro-frontend technologies. Our goal is to enable seamless connectivity between DTs and develop tailored presentation layers by decomposing complex systems into modular web-based DTs. Additionally, our framework tackles the challenges posed by multi-vendor elements within DTs and facilitates service and virtual environment orchestration for seamless integration and operation, enabling real-time data exchange between virtual models and physical machinery. Insights from its implementation across various applications, including training, monitoring, and control, shed light on its advantages and limitations. This research aims to revolutionize DT creation and management by introducing a scalable and adaptable framework designed to enable Web 3D for Industry and Manufacturing. By integrating cutting-edge micro-frontend technologies, our approach seeks to enhance maintainability, efficiency, and productivity. However, potential limitations such as code duplication and app payload concerns must be acknowledged. Future research will address these limitations to broaden applicability and improve performance. Overall, our proposed framework offers promising solutions to many challenges in industrial settings, paving the way for more efficient and effective DT deployment and management.}

This economy straddles both the physical and digital worlds—the items within it are bought and sold via digital currencies that can be exchanged for other digital currencies recognized in the physical world. Decentralized worlds are both places for users to “own” what they have in the environment in a new and more complete way and act as exchanges for the buying and selling of unique digital goods. While the user may “own” a digital object (unlike the environments explored in Chapter 6), there are still codes of conduct and the administrator of the environment retains an ability to terminate access.

abstract = {Recent advances in today’s Internet introduced huge demand for End-to-End Quality of Service (E2E QoS) assurances for delivering different types of traffic (video, live streaming, and telemedicine), originating from a wide spectrum of applications. Such applications stretch across multiple administrative domains and require fair and robust coordination for E2E QoS provisioning. While the selection of trusted domains is of paramount importance for the successful realization of E2E QoS, the issue of domain’s trust while finding E2E QoS paths has not been actively explored in the existing works. Trust awareness reduces the risk of violating QoS and improves the confidence of operating QoS across multiple domains. However, identifying trusted domains, finding the source of trust, and quantifying trust are the major challenges for enabling trust aware E2E QoS routing. Auditability of QoS implementation results at each domain forms a vital source for verifying QoS compliance and subsequently evaluating the trust of the domain. However, securely obtaining logs from the domains and identifying the accountability of domains for E2E QoS, without relying on a third party introduces significant difficulty when evaluating domain trust with respect to QoS compliance. This work proposes Trust aware E2E QoS Routing (TRAQR) framework for provisioning E2E QoS with trust and verifying the QoS compliance in Multi-Domain Software Defined Networks (MD-SDN). TRAQR efficiently leverages the tamper-proof and decentralized properties of Blockchain to store and exchange different kinds of trust information required to provision and verify E2E QoS compliance of the domains. This work developed a proof of concept implementation of the TRAQR in an MD-SDN environment emulated using Mininet, RYU SDN controller, Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to demonstrate the performance and benefits of TRAQR. Further, the simulations showed that the domain trust parameter introduced significant improvement in QoS compliance, even in the presence of untrusted domains.}

abstract = {More edge users opt to use Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect their data (e.g., health data, social data, e-governance data, etc.), which are stored in central cloud service providers (CSPs). However, this compromises data privacy and creates issues with collusion attacks. Current ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) schemes with and without blockchain have only partially addressed these issues. Ongoing challenges remain to be resolved, including large-universe attribute management, secret key verification, and malicious attribute authorities (AAs) tracking. Therefore, we propose a decentralized access control scheme (namely BLUMA-CPABE) integrating blockchain with multi-authority ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (MA-CP-ABE). The scheme not only supports large-universe, policy hiding, and AAs tracking, but it also utilizes on- and off-chain mechanisms to alleviate the computation burden of the blockchain. In addition, we develop a verifiable key distribution approach in which AAs are configured as blockchain consensus nodes capable of issuing, signing, validating, and disseminating secret keys as transactions on-chain. It guarantees the keys’ security and reliability. To incentivize authorities to control newly added attributes proactively for large-universe, we enhance the Proof-of-Authority (called PoA＋) consensus mechanism in multi-authority scenarios. It allows authorities to take turns proposing and confirming new blocks based on three contribution indicators: attribute management contribution, data decryption contribution, and block validation gain. The proposed scheme is proven statically secure while resisting collusion attacks. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our scheme.}

abstract = {Given the ongoing transition towards a more decentralised and adaptive energy system, the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts for the energy sector is being increasingly recognised. Due to their self-executing, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.}

Since these special SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks have different characteristics from the widely studied SCs designed for business logic, we name them Intelligent Contracts (ICs) for a focused study. In this paper, we systematically analyze ICs and propose a constructive framework for their construction and application. Specifically, we first formulate two construction modes of current ICs, including encoding AI models and scheduling AI collaboration. Then, we compare the characteristics of these two modes theoretically and experimentally as a reference for future mode selection. Finally, to extend the application of ICs and encourage AI-driven blockchain intelligence, we propose a technical route that helps blockchain autonomously respond to AI tasks through the dynamic and optimal configuration of ICs. Using typical AI tasks of classifying IRIS, MNIST, and ImageNet data sets as examples, we implement and thoroughly evaluate two modes of ICs on Ethereum. Based on the constructed ICs, we illustrate their optimal configuration and automatic response process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.}

Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.}

One of the leading causes of climate change is the emissions of harmful gases, particularly CO2. In 1997, the Kyoto protocol was signed by 192 countries, creating a system that monetizes CO2 emissions with an aim to control them. Most countries signed a carbon trading scheme, but the scheme fell short of its goals due to manipulation, lack of integrity, and multiple other challenges. This work presents an improved blockchain-based approach to achieve the objective of monitoring the reduction of carbon emissions. Blockchain's distinct features such as security, immutability, transparency, traceability, and trust, make it a robust and reliable solution for the carbon trading market. Previous Blockchain-based proposals were not comprehensive, practical, applicable, or efficient enough to form an effective solution. This research addresses the current gaps and proposes a comprehensive three-stage hierarchical blockchain framework that employs smart contracts in Blockchain of Things (BoT) to ensure integrity in the system and reach fair trade status that favors the environment over companies' cost reductions and profit-making. The result is an optimized carbon emission trading framework, fully transparent with automated trading and control mechanisms.}

abstract = {Smart contracts are widely used on the blockchain to implement complex transactions, such as decentralized applications on Ethereum. Effective vulnerability detection of large-scale smart contracts is critical, as attacks on smart contracts often cause huge economic losses. Since it is difficult to repair and update smart contracts, it is necessary to find the vulnerabilities before they are deployed. However, code analysis, which requires traversal paths, and learning methods, which require many features to be trained, are too time-consuming to detect large-scale on-chain contracts. Learning-based methods will obtain detection models from a feature space compared to code analysis methods such as symbol execution. But the existing features lack the interpretability of the detection results and training model, even worse, the large-scale feature space also affects the efficiency of detection. This paper focuses on improving the detection efficiency by reducing the dimension of the features, combined with expert knowledge. In this paper, a feature extraction model Block-gram is proposed to form low-dimensional knowledge-based features from bytecode. First, the metadata is separated and the runtime code is converted into a sequence of opcodes, which are divided into segments based on some instructions (jumps, etc.). Then, scalable Block-gram features, including 4-dimensional block features and 8-dimensional attribute features, are mined for the learning-based model training. Finally, feature contributions are calculated from SHAP values to measure the relationship between our features and the results of the detection model. In addition, six types of vulnerability labels are made on a dataset containing 33,885 contracts, and these knowledge-based features are evaluated using seven state-of-the-art learning algorithms, which show that the average detection latency speeds up 25× to 650×, compared with the features extracted by N-gram, and also can enhance the interpretability of the detection model.}

Despite the fact that the government of Taiwan has started to conduct research to advance technology related to offshore wind turbines, little attention has been paid to the establishment or adjustment of the legal framework and administrative mechanism that would permit effective and streamlined OWP development. Japan's administrative mechanisms are examined, and may be instructive; Lessons from the Japanese model include categorizing OWP under ocean policy rather than energy policy. Furthermore, a Headquarters for Ocean Policy was established as the highest coordinative and decision-making mechanism, and involves the Prime Minister, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, the Minister of Ocean Policy and others, and they usually meet on a regular basis. Thus, a coordinative mechanism similar to that of Japan, be it the newly established Ocean Council or the reinstatement of the Commission for the Promotion of Marine Affairs, could be a workable solution to address current challenges and difficulties faced by the development of OWP in Taiwan.}

In so doing, we have identified some evidence that returns are impacted by tweets, but not by social indicators that appear to be more relevant for volatility. We have further confirmed that the S&P500 Index negatively influences cryptocurrency returns, which means that these two asset classes are substitutes. Uncertainty and attention indices are relevant in determining returns and the alternative measurement of volatility. However, they remain insignificant for illiquidity and our initial volatility choice.}

abstract = {Due to millions of loosely coupled devices, the smart-home security is gaining the attention of industry professionals, attackers, and academic researchers. The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users’ daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data’s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.}

Unlike traditional marketplaces, our proposed system emphasizes trustworthiness by mitigating third-party risks, enhancing data integrity through decentralized storage, and employing graph technology for efficient blockchain querying. Further, with integrated access control, our system elevates security standards. Preliminary evaluations reveal the system’s potential to offer a more secure, transparent, auditable, and trustworthy data trading environment, distinctly outpacing the capabilities of current marketplaces.}

However, existing MCS systems operate in a centralized manner, giving rise to several challenges, including privacy, security, incentives, and dependence on a central service provider. Blockchain is a novel application paradigm that incorporates point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, intelligent contracts, distributed data storage, and other computing technologies, creating a shift from the current centralized paradigm to a decentralized paradigm. Nonetheless, the convergence of MCS and blockchains necessitates addressing numerous fundamental challenges arising from their merger. This paper examines the major issues facing MCS systems and blockchain’s potential role in addressing them. We present the MCS-blockchain integrated deployment strategies, architectural designs, and core blockchain technology principles that contribute significantly to the performance of blockchain-based MCS applications. Additionally, the advancement of blockchain technology and its impact on MCS system security and performance requirements are investigated. Finally, we highlight current research gaps and future research opportunities that may inspire the deployment of novel blockchain-based MCS systems.}

In response to these challenges, we propose a two-layer blockchain-based platform comprising the Decentralized Identity Blockchain (DID Chain) and the Physiological Data Blockchain (App Chain). Within the DID chain, we deploy two contracts: the IdentityManager Contract and the PersonalIdentity Contract. Users are empowered to register their decentralized identity, while governments can leverage the IdentityManager Contract to generate decentralized identities. Once users obtain their identity, they can proceed to register the app-chain using that identity. Moreover, users can utilize the AccessControlManager chaincode within the App-chain to share de-identified information generated by their wearable devices, retaining full control over managing the access control rights of their de-identified information. Through the integration of these two chains, our system significantly enhances user data privacy, security, and trust, thereby fostering confidence in the integration of wearable devices within the home healthcare data sharing process.}

However, conventional prefabricated construction projects often suffer from challenges of managing numerous paper-based documentation, non-standardized management and intricate stakeholders in construction site management (CSM). The current design approaches lack sufficient consideration of the activity-based user relationships. To facilitate the system framework design and implementation for CSM, this study proposes a generic Cyber-physical Centered (CCD) Design, illustrating an effective and systematic approach to identify user-activity relationships in a cross-collaborative context. The consideration of entity, value chain and user-activity relationships facilitate identity management and value chain management services. The proposed approach was then utilized to a pilot project to design and implement the Blockchain-enabled Cyber-physical Site Management System (BCSMS) integrated with Digital Work Supervision System (DWSS), incorporating considerations on multi-source information flow and user-centric applications design. The implemented BCSMS decentralized two types of fundamental documents in CSM - Request for Inspection and Survey Checking (RISC) form and site diary. It addresses information fragmentation and asymmetry in a cross-collaborative environment caused by manual-input and error-prone records. The proposed system was evaluated by two important system performance indicators in terms of average response time and transaction per second. The system performance test shows that the accountability of BCSMS is significant compared to DWSS, given the p-value 0.01. Blockchain effectively improves DWSS with enhanced data submission, identity management and data-driven site performance evaluation functions. This study also qualitatively analyzed the pros and cons of proposed blockchain-enabled cyber-physical system (CPS) from society-economy-technology aspects for technical practitioners, construction stakeholders and governments.}

abstract = {Smart contracts (SC) run on blockchain technology (BCT) to implement agreements between several parties. As BCT grows, organizations aim to automate their processes and engage in business collaborations using SCs. The translation of contract semantics into SC language semantics is difficult due to ambiguous contractual interpretation by the several parties and the developers. Also, an SC language itself misses the language constructs needed for semantically expressing collaboration terms. This leads to SC coding errors that result in contractual conflicts over transactions during the performance of SCs and thus, novel SC solutions incur high development and maintenance costs. Various model-based and no/low code development approaches address this issue by enabling higher abstractions in SC development. Still, the question remains unanswered how contractual parties, i.e., end-users with non-IT skills, manage to develop legally relevant SCs with ease. This study aims to (1) identify and categorize the state of the art of SC automation models, in terms of their technical features, and their legal significance, and to (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a systematic literature review (SLR) that follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham for performing SLRs in software-engineering. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 1367 papers are collected, and 33 of them are selected for extraction and analysis. The contributions of this article are threefold: (1) 10 different SC automation models/frameworks are identified and classified according to their technical and implementation features; (2) 11 different legal contract parameters are identified and categorized into 4 legal criteria classes; (3) a comparative analysis of SC-automation models in the context of their legal significance is conducted that identifies the degrees to which the SC-automation models are considered legally relevant. As a conclusion, we produce a comprehensive and replicable overview of the state of the art of SC automation models and a systematic measure of their legal significance to benefit practitioners in the field.}

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to suggest a Library 4.0 model based on the concepts of Library 4.0 discussed in the literature as the future of library service. The concepts and model of Library 4.0 can be adapted to fit every different kind of library.
Design/Methodology/Approach
For this purpose, first, major reference databases (e.g. Google Scholar, EbscoHost, LISA, etc.) were examined for literature that discusses Web 4.0 and Library 4.0. Second, examples of information technology environments as well as studies and news articles related to information technology were comprehensively collected and analyzed by focusing on those which may influence libraries. Third, examples of cutting-edge information technology applied in libraries were examined and analyzed. Other examples were found of cutting-edge information technologies that have not yet been used in libraries but would be applicable to the next-generation library. Fourth, this study developed a model for next-generation library service provided by Library 4.0 and representative keywords explaining Library 4.0.
Findings
First, opinions of scholars tracking the rise of Web 4.0 vary widely, but Web 4.0 features commonly suggested by previous researchers are: reading, writing, and executing simultaneously, intelligence-based agents, connected web, ubiquitous web, intelligence connections, and intelligence-based web. Secondly, this study determined the features of Library 4.0 as: intelligence-based, massive data, augmented reality, context aware, cutting-edge displays, and infinite creative space. Third, in this context, the keywords that best explain Library 4.0 are: Intelligent, Makerspace, Context-Aware Technology, Open Source, Big Data, Cloud Service, Augmented Reality, State-of-the-art Display, and Librarian 4.0.
Originality/Value
Discussions about Web 4.0 have begun, but little has been written about Library 4.0. This study is significant for deriving keywords for Library 4.0 and presenting the development direction of Library 4.0. In the future, research on Library 4.0 can actively proceed from this starting point.}

While vulnerability detectors can prevent vulnerable contracts from being deployed, this does not mean that such contracts will not be deployed. Once a vulnerable contract is instantiated on the blockchain and becomes the target of attacks, the identification of exploit transactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually exploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved. In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum attacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoC) specially crafted for use in the blockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful exploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a model for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that mirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we compare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their effectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for investigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that coarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit transactions with less computation. However, they are contract-specific and suffer from false negatives. On the other hand, fine-grained IoCs defined over virtual machine instructions can avoid these pitfalls at the expense of increased computation, which is nevertheless applicable for practical use.}

For a subset of publicly listed clubs, we find that stock and token returns are uncorrelated. Instead, fan tokens tend to closely co-move with each other and the main cryptocurrencies used for buying them. Returns are lower on days when the club unexpectedly loses a game, but higher on days of increased investor attention towards fan tokens. While fan tokens may provide some non-monetary utility, as financial assets they are highly speculative and, in many aspects, resemble cryptocurrencies.}

This study aims to recontextualize a major manifestation of this transformation, a crime called hybrid investment fraud, colloquially known as pig butchering. Hybrid investment fraud describes a cyber-enabled fraud whereby criminals gain the trust of victims by forming connections and relationships, and then exploit this trust by using a series of confidence building and coercive measures designed to encourage victims to continuously invest in securities or commodities until they become unable or unwilling to continue to make payments or the offenders become unreachable. This study further aims to address the existing knowledge gap by focusing on understudied elements of this fraud, such victim and offender characteristics and the ways hybrid investment fraud is perpetrated. To achieve this, we conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 1,300 news articles and court documents between January 1, 2018, and November 1, 2023, to identify 59 cases of hybrid investment fraud targeting victims in the United States. This article both situates hybrid investment fraud within the broader fraud literature and conducts a comprehensive of analysis of hybrid investment fraud cases to identify the types of hybrid investment fraud committed, their impact, victim and offender demographics, and offenders’ tactics, tools, and methods of operation. The findings from this study can inform criminal justice practices and future research of this fraud.}

Firstly, we propose a model to count newly arrived tips (transactions) into a selected timeframe and calculate the transaction time before joining the Tangle network as a new tip. Selecting secure transactions for approval requires an accurate tip selection method. Secondly, we develop the Best Tip Selection Method (BTSM) to increase network security and to incorporate the priority level for essential or prioritized IoT transactions. Thirdly, we develop a multiple-objective unconstrained optimization strategy, the Best Approver Selection Method (BASM). The objective of BASM is to optimize the trade-off between the multiplication of network latency and the cumulative weight of transactions and approvers’ Tangle time after joining the network. Finally, we estimate the probability of malicious attacks on a Tangle network by assuming the transactions’ cumulative weight increases linearly with transaction arrival speed to a Tangle. We adapt the fault-tolerance relationship to secure the system. We then analyze our model to decide that requires us to consider the trade-off between these two factors to obtain the optimal value. Our results show that BTSM and BASM are viable solutions for next-generation Industrial IoT networks with fast machine-to-machine communications. Compared with IOTA and other existing strategies, our proposed model offers the advantage of identifying the probability of malicious attacks with high accuracy; thus minimizing malicious attacks and optimizing the network latency for next-generation Industrial IoT networks. In summary, the proposed mechanism would allow adding more transactions from IoT devices to the IOTA Tangle and discourage existing malicious transactions from verifying new transactions. The proposed mechanism could be utilized in real-world applications, including enabling preference levels for essential or prioritized activities and fault-tolerance adaptation. IOTA aims to play a vital role in the next-generation industrial revolution; our study advances the IOTA Tangle to move a step forward towards this direction.}

Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.}

Portuguese real estate investment funds represent a unique opportunity to investigate executive behavior regarding accounting choice, as fund managers may choose to use historical cost, fair value or a mixed system (historical cost with internal revaluations) to value fund properties. We also investigate the factors that influence this strategic behavior. Empirical results confirm that fund managers manage asset valuations in order to avoid net asset value declines, particularly in a period of financial distress. We also observe that funds with a higher level of past unconditional conservatism are more likely to manage asset values. With respect to corporate governance issues, we conclude that audit quality reduces managerial discretion and that the conflicts that may arise between fund management company shareholders and fund participants due to management fees do not seem to have impact on fund managers’ opportunistic behavior.}
