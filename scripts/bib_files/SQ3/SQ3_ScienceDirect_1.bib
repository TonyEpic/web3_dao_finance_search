abstract = {The 5G mobile Internet facilitates contents generation for online communities and platforms through human-to-human collaboration. Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile giving users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of a smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

Ill-sourced minerals not only finance terrorism, human trafficking, and other major issues in society, but they deter deliberately conscientious organizations from their goals of achieving genuinely sustainable products that are considerate towards the environment and society. This paper aims to understand the problem of responsible sourcing from the point of view of the mining and the metallurgical industry. The study helps identify areas of improvement for this global industry to minimize conflict originating from natural resource development and achieve the noble goal of being certified as Conflict Free. Further, existing paths to accreditation are classified into three categories: Certification Approaches, Analytical Approaches, and Inscription Approaches. A comparison of the approaches is given on parameters like accuracy, cost of implementation, and difficulty of implementation. The study finds that although Analytical Approaches appear to be the most feasible among all the other approaches, their extremely high cost of implementation has prevented their wide adoption, thus perpetuating the difficulty of systematically managing the problem of conflict minerals at scale. Finally, the use of Blockchain Technology (BCT) to overcome the limitations of current mineral traceability schemes is given. Due to limited academic research on this topic, the focus was diverted to how other industries have utilized BCT and proposed the next steps for mineral researchers.}

A deeper comprehension of the metaverse ecosystem is crucial to facilitate long-term planning and the dynamic adaptation of business models in the closely related e-commerce sector. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to explore how the metaverse impacts e-commerce business models. A two-round Delphi-based scenario study (time horizon 2035) was conducted with 26 participating experts to achieve the objective. Based on the expert responses, twenty projections were clustered into three possible future scenarios: (1) immersive and emotional commerce, (2) altered digital landscape, and (3) game changer. The scenarios indicate that the metaverse development will strongly influence e-commerce business models at the customer interface and core strategy. New business models will emerge, and existing business models will adopt the metaverse as an additional channel. As purely digital products gain increased importance, the digital landscape will be altered to fulfill new customer requests. Although improbable by 2035, the game-changing scenario entails a complete transition to digital products and the replacement of present e-commerce with metaverse commerce.}

Our aim is to explore how toolkits theory applies to Web3 innovation, proposing that Web3 innovation is being organized through toolkits (e.g., blockchains, token standards, DAO frameworks) that enable efficient organization of sticky information to facilitate innovation. The contribution of this paper is the first application of toolkits theory to Web3, reframing its development as a problem of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of distributed information. We provide implications for the role of developers as user innovators, the economic problem of emergent toolkit stacking, and the design of toolkit business models.}

Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).}

It has gained substantial attention recently due to its immersive, interconnected, and virtual environment for meeting evolving customer and market demands. As technology advances, firms implementing the Metaverse may gain a competitive edge and create new revenue streams. However, the service sectors still face challenges in adopting and successfully implementing Metaverse. Therefore, we attempted to establish a theoretical foundation to understand the challenges of Metaverse adoption in the service sector and to develop an integrated framework to analyse the barriers using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) techniques. To achieve this, we first identify barriers from extensive literature and categorise them into six broad categories based on experts’ opinions. Then, we ranked each category and the barriers constituting them based on their criticality through FAHP. The Security and Privacy category has the highest weight among the six categories of barriers, followed by Governance and Standardisation, Infrastructure, User Behaviour and psychology, Feasibility, and Organisational culture and Stakeholder commitment. Further, we developed the causal-effect relationships among the six categories and analysed those categories through the degree of prominence and relationships. We found that Security and Privacy is one of the most influencing barriers. Then, we analysed our proposed decision-making model under different scenarios through sensitivity analysis. This study offers valuable insights into the relationships among the barriers and how they can impact progress towards achieving specific goals or objectives.}

abstract = {Electronic Commodity Trading has a pivotal role in our economic activities. In the literature, there is a classic problem called “Fair Exchange” which is fundamental to electronic commodity trading. It means the participants can receive the exchange item of the counterparty as they have agreed on before. Since the ownership of items online is often authorized by digital signatures, we focus on the problem of the fair exchange of digital signatures in this paper. As the concept of the Metaverse becomes popular recently, what we are concerned about is how the fair exchange will evolve in a metaverse. It is said that the metaverse is a vision of how the next generation of the internet will operate and the research for the fair exchange problem in it is essential for a wide range of applications like trading a (Non-fungible-token) NFT. Many cryptographic fair exchange protocols are proposed to deal with such a problem. However, most of them should rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and the security is restricted by the TTP. The way the metaverse will work is still being defined. But it will probably provide users with a decentralized environment and a fair exchange protocol relying on a TTP seems unsuitable for it. Recently, researchers present some blockchain-based fair exchange protocols to get rid of or reduce the power of a TTP. But these blockchain-based protocols face new challenges. Firstly, cryptography pairing operations are often contained in such a TTP-free protocol and cost too much for the blockchain. Secondly, the player may hang for an unacceptably long time of the latency of the blockchain network. Thirdly, it is difficult to protect the privacy of the signatures while making the whole protocol verifiable at the same time. To bridge these research gaps, this paper presents a novel signature exchange protocol called DFSE which is decentralized, verifiable, efficient and autonomous. To give a real-world evaluation, we perform the experiment on the live test network of Ethereum and the results show that our protocol is feasible.}

The suggested model explains how users’ perceptions of specific features of such concepts influence acceptance in ways that existing theories like TPB, TAM, or UTAUT cannot. The results revealed that user empowerment was the most significant factor influencing acceptance. Furthermore, multigroup analysis (MGA) demonstrates how different contexts have distinct acceptance predictors. Depending on the context, perceived lower fees, perceived faster settlement, perceived income distribution, perceived fraudproof, and perceived traceability had varying significance. Meanwhile, perceived immutability, perceived process automation, and perceived transparency, even though considered appealing, were not significant in influencing acceptance. The findings imply that stakeholders should balance technicality and behavioural aspects, and be aware of the context.}

Through this research, we have identified key topics such as investment security or corporate challenges that provide valuable insights and structured information essential for industry stakeholders. In summary, this study explores the dynamic interplay between blockchain technology, ICOs, STOs and social media in the industry. It sheds light on the sentiment and implications of the use of this technology and these emerging financial models, offering a nuanced understanding of their impact on the market. Thus, the idea that user opinions play a crucial role in influencing decisions is supported, and their impact can fluctuate depending on the changing dynamics of the market.}

A key innovation within ReFi is the tokenization of carbon credits. Consequently, this study explores the return connectedness among ReFi, carbon, fossil energy, and clean energy markets, employing a quantile time–frequency connectedness framework. Our findings indicate a relatively weak and time-varying trend in return connectedness. Notably, the pairwise connectedness within the ReFi-carbon-energy system becomes more pronounced during extreme market conditions compared to normal conditions. Moreover, clean energy markets of all sub-sectors serve as net spillover transmitters across different quantiles and time–frequency domains. In contrast, ReFi markets act as net receivers in the short term but evolve into net transmitters in the medium term, especially under extreme market conditions. Next, we examine the impacts of determinants on total connectedness, which demonstrate heterogeneity across different time horizons and market conditions. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of ReFi assets as effective diversification and hedging tools for carbon-energy portfolios. Our findings not only provide guidance for ReFi investors in constructing more cost-effective investment strategies, but also assist ReFi policymakers in cultivating a broader and trustworthier application of ReFi.}

Our research method is a multiple case study examining a total of 120 use cases. across all primary types of intellectual properties including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, industrial design and geographical indications. The empirical validation is based on an in-depth within-case analysis of 26 applications which were selected from the initial 120 cases based on business maturity and popularity criteria. Our goal is to understand which intellectual property challenges distributed ledger technology is trying to solve and how. We also investigate which blockchain benefits, in terms of technological security, immutability, decentralization, tokenization or disintermediation are promoted by these applications. We triangulate our case study results using a PESTEL coding framework to better understand how the blockchain ecosystem manages the intellectual property life cycle and to provide scholarly researchers and practitioners with insights on how enterprises can use distributed ledger technology to enhance the management of the intellectual property value chain. Moreover, we validate theoretical findings through the evidence collected from our multiple case study analysis, and finally we provide strategic guidance in investigating the current and anticipated challenges of blockchain entrepreneurs to drive further distributed ledger innovation.}

abstract = {Key stakeholders across different industries with competing visions, motivations and technology bets are investing significant financial resources in developing the building blocks of the metaverse. The purpose of this opinion piece aimed primarily at practitioners is to explore the key question: What is needed to make the metaverse real? What are the key uncertainties that must be resolved? We are motivated by shedding light on whether the metaverse is just a new marketing buzzword or a new transformative trend. We have identified six areas with key uncertainties, which require agreement and solutions from industry players – the space, the interface, the IT infrastructure, the monetary infrastructure, the digital ID and the energy. These uncertainties will be resolved in a series of cooperative and competitive games among the key stakeholders who will need to work on being aligned on a set of standards. The practical implication is that the metaverse cannot be ignored, but there are non-trivial challenges that need to be resolved first. Our paper provides a framework for practitioners to think through these issues in a more systematic fashion.}

But how might project management supported by blockchain technology look like? And how would such a new form change and affect traditional project management? Not many concepts have been designed or even implemented yet. We chose an experimental framework to answer the first aspects of these questions. We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.}

Three themes emerge from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) voting structure, (2) proposal management, and (3) token management. Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose. However, the operations and methods implemented are more oriented toward agency viewpoints due to their reliance on incentive-based processing and are based on a lack of trust among DAO stakeholders.

In general, the waste management sector has struggled with low consumer trust, fraud, manipulation, significant manual processes, and low levels of information and control. Recent events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted, in particular, the role of trust in effective public policy making and consumer behavioural change. Here we propose a hybrid blockchain solution called a Polkadot parachain. Polkadot is a blockchain technology that connects a network of blockchains, each called a parachain, that can be customised to the business needs of a given application. This solution provides the cost benefits, scalability, and control of a permissioned or private blockchain while providing the security, verifiability, and trust of a public blockchain. The solution is developed with a design science approach and combines three typically separate blockchain use cases: supply chain tracking, incentivisation through a payment system, and gamification to achieve a complete solution for waste management. We provide a detailed discussion on the design of this blockchain solution with the use of blockchain functionality assessed against the criteria and development approaches found in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how such a blockchain can be implemented with the Substrate blockchain development framework.}

Information systems (IS) are implemented to overcome these gaps as part of digitalization efforts. In the CE context, IS can provide insights into the sustainability and circularity of a product and its value chain. In fact, many products come into existence through supply chains encompassing plentiful suppliers and complex in-use and after-use streams. Implementing CE IS, like obligatory product passports, will significantly scale up information technologies (IT) use. Environmental impacts through IT use, and diverse product lifecycles call for an architecture that allows such a degree of complexity while minimizing burdens. This conference paper summarizes our preliminary results on designing an architecture for CE IS. First, we reviewed the literature on product passports. We created an architecture based on the design science methodology, including a meta-model providing an overview of all concepts. We also show how the architecture can facilitate the CE IS implementation by an example case of remanufacturing. Our results advocate rethinking the concept of product-centered systems towards IS that are more based on CE and digital services.}

abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.}

abstract = {The integration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in healthcare, particularly in cardiovascular medicine, represents a disruptive shift towards enhancing the security and interconnection of electronic health data around the patient. NFTs, unique digital certificates stored on a blockchain network, bind various sources of health data to their owner (the patient) and delineate the access rights for stakeholders (providers, researchers) using smart contracts. Data sources may include electronic medical records from different hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, test centers, and mHealth devices. Accordingly, patients and their providers benefit from seamless visibility of diagnoses, medications, electrocardiograms, imaging, home blood pressure logs, and artificial intelligence-enabled insights from these aggregated data. Rather than being stored on proprietary servers, data are encrypted and stored on decentralized networks with a unified point of access and immutable proof of ownership, making them more robust to theft or tampering. As custodians of their NFT, patients are incentivized to actively partake in their health monitoring and self-driven research that aligns with their needs using innovative marketplaces that allow them to browse studies, document their informed consent, and monetize their contributions. Furthermore, they are empowered to educate themselves and seek care across siloes in traditional settings or virtual platforms such as the metaverse, where NFTs serves as digital passports. Despite these exciting prospects, adoption within the healthcare sector remains in its infancy, with ethical and technical limitations still being addressed. This article explores the multifaceted applications and key players in the field, and outlines use-cases for patient-centered cardiovascular care featuring NFTs.}

In the second phase, we collected and examined code-related data from GitHub and market-related data from blockchain browsers (e.g., Etherscan) for these projects. Our analysis revealed that the Web3 ecosystem can be categorized into two groups, i.e., Web3 infrastructure and Web3 applications, with each consisting of several subcategories or subdomains.

abstract = {In digitization, judicial investigations have transitioned towards digital storage of forensic shreds of evidence as electronic law records (ELRs). The shift poses varied challenges of ELR preservation, homogeneity of case formats, chronology in recorded statements by suspects, time-stamping and digital signatures on ELRs, and the chain of transfer of cases to different law enforcement agencies (LEAs) over open channels. Thus, privacy and trust among judicial stakeholders-case appellant (CA), case defendant (CD), the police officer (PO), defence lawyer (DL), prosecutor lawyers (PL), LEAs, and court judge is a prime concern. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, the paper presents a blockchain (BC)-based ELR management scheme, NyaYa, that operates as a four-phased scheme of judicial stakeholder registration in BC, case registration with meta-hash keys in public BC, that reference an external off-chain interplanetary file storage (IPFS), chronology of investigative updates among LEAs, and case hearing and settlement through smart contracts (SCs). In the simulation, NyaYa is compared to traditional ELR storage schemes for parameters like mining cost, query fetching time, block processing time, obtained IPFS throughput, signing latency, the effect of collusion attacks, ELR processing time, and corrupted indexes in IPFS. We also presented formal verification and proposed functionalities of SCs. In simulation, at 6 USD mining cost, NyaYa can append 22456 transactions, compared to 21497 and 3000 transactions respectively in existing schemes. The achieved query fetching time is 0.852 milli-seconds (ms), at 25 blocks, with cache support of 32 kilobyte (KB). The scheme has an average signing latency of 622.95ms, and achieves a high-trust probability of 0.887 %, compared to 0.765 % in consortium BC, and 0.455 % in private BC, at 500, colluding nodes. An improvement of 6.77 % is achieved in ELR uploading latency, and the scheme has only 21 corrupted IPFS indexes for 350 fetched ELRs. The obtained results indicate the efficacy of the proposed scheme against conventional schemes.}

abstract = {In the context of extreme societal polarization, activists have mobilized to protest injustices and claim their rights, yet such efforts often fall short of goals because demands normally are directed to government or firms that offer superficial responses. Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.}

In this study, unlike the existing literature, a blockchain-based solution is developed for local cargo networks. With this approach using Ultra High Radio Frequency (UHF-RFID), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain-based smart contracts, a fast shipping management architecture that ensures security between the parties is provided. In this context, an automatic payment and approval mechanism is established between the parties using ethereum-based smart contracts. In addition, shipments equipped with RFID tags are automatically tracked and traceable using UHF-RFID antennas. The IoT data collected in the study are stored on a cloud-based server, which is a cost-effective solution. Smart contracts that enable communication between the parties are written in the Solidity language using the Ganache, Truffle and Metamask platforms. It was observed that the integration between the technologies is ensured and the communication between the parties works successfully in the test processes.}

Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research. Overall, this article provides critical guidance to brand managers, policy advisors, and academics seeking to understand, build, and trust Web3 technology.}

However, practical implementation of performance contracts has been limited due to challenges with performance evaluation, accountability, and financial concepts. As a solution, this paper proposes the connection of the digital building twin with blockchain-based smart contracts to execute performance-based digital payments. First, we conceptualize a technical architecture to connect blockchain to digital building twins. The digital building twin stores and evaluates performance data in real-time. The blockchain ensures transparency and trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards through smart contracts. Next, we demonstrate the feasibility of both the concept and technical architecture by integrating the Ethereum blockchain with digital building models and sensors via the Siemens building twin platform. The resulting prototype is the first full-stack implementation of a performance-based smart contract in the built environment.}

However, existing MCS systems operate in a centralized manner, giving rise to several challenges, including privacy, security, incentives, and dependence on a central service provider. Blockchain is a novel application paradigm that incorporates point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, intelligent contracts, distributed data storage, and other computing technologies, creating a shift from the current centralized paradigm to a decentralized paradigm. Nonetheless, the convergence of MCS and blockchains necessitates addressing numerous fundamental challenges arising from their merger. This paper examines the major issues facing MCS systems and blockchain’s potential role in addressing them. We present the MCS-blockchain integrated deployment strategies, architectural designs, and core blockchain technology principles that contribute significantly to the performance of blockchain-based MCS applications. Additionally, the advancement of blockchain technology and its impact on MCS system security and performance requirements are investigated. Finally, we highlight current research gaps and future research opportunities that may inspire the deployment of novel blockchain-based MCS systems.}

We develop a conceptual model and testable propositions that extend the work of McKnight et al. (2001, 2002, 2011) to the blockchain ecosystem based on an integrative literature review. We conceptualize trust as a multidimensional, multi-object construct combining three major objects of trust: algorithmic trust in the blockchain protocol (platform), trust towards peers and services providers, and trust in decentralized applications (product). The model reflects the process of building a trust layer for users and institutions on top of the trustless technology. The paper demystifies the trust building process, from initial trust to knowledge-based trust, and its dimensions within the blockchain ecosystem, and, consequently, helps practitioners to build strategies that increase users' trust. The contribution to the academic literature resides in the unification of multiple perspectives on trust within an integrative conceptual framework to point out the mechanisms of trust building process, as well as to identify future research directions.}

For supporting this hypothesis, striking analogies between the concepts underlying blockchain technology with research are identified, and applied to the generation of verified knowledge in science and technology development. It is then elaborated how a blockchain-enabled token economy can efficiently and transparently incentivize and coordinate an integrative and community-inclusive participatory approach to fuel crowdsourcing of collective intelligence for contributing ideas, work, infrastructure, funding, data, validation, management, assessment, governance, arbitration and exploitation of projects. Quality, credibility and direction of projects are optimized by demanding collateral “skin-in-the-game” from contributors based on blockchain-enabled staking, reputation systems and prediction markets. This way research progress emerges as a chain of community generated and independently vetted blocks of scientific knowledge; these new blocks are concatenated with the state-of-the-art according to transparent consensus mechanisms.}

On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people. As a result, the current model suffers from good governance. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information. As a result, Blockchain adoption can improve the land title digitization effort of Bangladesh.}

Off-Chain Blockchain Systems (OCBS) enable this information processing and management through distributed software architecture where the blockchain network interacts with off-chain resources. Hence, OCBS are a critical data governance component in the design of enterprise blockchain solutions, resulting in extensive research and development exploring the interplay between on-chain and off-chain storage and computation and efforts to evaluate their performance relative to other information management systems. Key features of OCBS’ are their ability to improve scalability, reduce data storage requirements, and enhance data privacy, all extremely critical issues to enable broader blockchain adoption. These OCBS features map well to the needs of the healthcare industry, particularly due to the need to manage various types of medical, consumer, and other health-related data. However, different types of health data are also subject to stringent regulatory, security and legal requirements, a key factor limiting blockchain adoption in the sector. In response, there is a critical need to better align OCBS design features to different types of healthcare data management and their respective governance and privacy regimes. This article first reviews the characteristics of different constructs of OCBS. It then proposes a modular hybrid privacy-preserving framework leveraging off-chain and on-chain blockchain system design applied to three different reference models that illustrate how blockchain can enhance healthcare information management. Through this privacy-preserving framework we hope to liberate healthcare data by enabling sharing, sovereignty and enhanced trust.}

The underlying technology – blockchain and distributed ledger technology – was posed as a technological solution to the problems of trust, confidence, transparency and behaviour traditionally addressed in finance through a framework of law, regulation and institutions (including markets and the state). Cryptocurrencies, blockchain, distributed ledger technology and decentralised finance were designed to address the weaknesses and risks in traditional finance. Yet fifteen years of evolution culminating in the Crypto Winter of 2022–23 have demonstrated that crypto is neither special nor immune and has come to feature all the classic problems of traditional finance. As the crypto ecosystem has evolved, the market failures and externalities of traditional finance have emerged – a process we term the ‘financialisation’ of crypto. These include conflicts of interests, information asymmetries, centralisation and interconnections, over-enthusiastic market participants, plus agency, operational and financial risks. We argue that (a) in order to develop successfully going forward, the crypto ecosystem needs to assimilate the centuries of experience of underpinning traditional finance with law and regulation, and (b) in the aftermath of the Crypto Winter, an international consensus is crystalising in respect of the regulation of the crypto ecosystem. We argue regulatory systems are now being instituted to ensure the proper functioning of crypto and its interconnections with traditional finance. The lessons of the financialisation of crypto also apply more broadly: appropriately designed regulatory systems are central to financial market functioning and development.}

We have analysed the entire Web3 metaverse niche, i.e. both the 196 available metaverse fungible tokens and all the non-fungible token (NFT) transactions belonging to the metaverse marketplace. Our results showed that economic governance is based on metaverse tokens that cannot be defined as reliable virtual currencies due to their explosive behaviour, negative performance, and higher volatility compared to traditional alternatives. Paradoxically, fiat currencies and stablecoins could be more appropriate candidates for the payment infrastructure. Moreover, we also observed that NFT prices are affected by the cryptocurrency market, which highlights the risk of metaverse commerce. For future research, developers and scholars must assess the different alternatives and infrastructures that can make the metaverse a persistent reality with a proper virtual economy. However, at present, it seems that the hype has run far ahead of reality.}

Blockchain technology supports time-stamping, authentication, process coordination, non-repudiation, commercial transactions, and also provides security for transactions and storage. The pharmaceutical SCM demands accurate, immediate and secure control system. Additionally, the supply chain process data from IoTs is stored and processed in Cloud by Analytics applications, for business planning and improvement. An efficient and secure IoT-Cloud-Blockchain based system for both SCM automation and analytics has been proposed in this work. It leverages a hierarchical IoT, Mist, Edge, Fog, Cloud computing (IMEFC) architecture to enhance Communication-Response-Compute-Security-Storage (CRCSS) in the system. Blockchain technology provides security for the SCM transactions and data. The efficiency of the Blockchain is measured in terms of upload time, download time and transaction fees for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Filecoin platforms. The Filecoin blockchain platform is quicker and cost-effective for larger file sizes, compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin, making it suitable for Pharmaceutical SCM systems.}

The package represents a first attempt to regulate a complex and emerging phenomenon, characterised by significant trade-offs. Unsurprisingly, in this early stage of the law-making process several relevant aspects of the crypto environment remain unaddressed, such as pure DeFI models, DAOs, and NFTs. Such regulatory gap is to a large extent attributable to the difficulty of addressing technologically complex issues through command-and-control top-down legislation. The improvements delivered by the Better Regulation Agenda are not enough to solve this conundrum. In this context, the Communication by the Bank of Italy on Decentralised Technology in Finance and Crypto-assets and its first move, the smart-contract MoU, provide an interesting case study to discuss the potential of ‘participatory regulation.’ This experimental form of regulation tries to get the most out of co-regulation, self-regulation, and command-and-control, combining their characters with the view of reconciling the technology neutrality principle with technology-based regulation. Participatory regulation aims to bridge the public and private sector in order to strike a right balance between flexibility and legal certainty, without stifling innovation.}

However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.}

However, by following the Bisq Trade Protocol and interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use novel address clustering heuristics to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We describe address clustering heuristics for both the Bisq Trade Protocol and the Bisq DAO. We show that the heuristics aggregate activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.}

The alternative finance industry leverages innovative technologies, such as direct lending, crowdfunding, automated wealth management, on-demand insurance, and digital currencies. This feature aligns well with the DeFi principles, and it is also beneficial to CeFi. Distributed ledger platforms offer transparency and security for both DeFi and CeFi, whereas future payment technologies provide user-friendly solutions. This study applies novel wavelet and quantile cross-spectral coherence analyses to obtain nuanced relationship insights. This methodology categorizes crypto finance into the DeFi and broader cryptocurrency ecosystems to facilitate robust comparison with traditional banking. It further delineates democratized banking into alternative financing mechanisms, distributed ledger technologies, and future payment capabilities. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals time–frequency associations, whereas quantile cross-spectral coherence unveils extreme connections under different market conditions. The findings suggest the existence of dynamic relationships between inclusive banking components and various financial infrastructures. These relationships vary across return distributions and time scales. In regular markets, positive associations are seen in yearly and monthly frequency cycles with alternative finance and centralized services exhibiting the strongest linkage. During periods of extremely high returns, CeFi and centralized-decentralized (hybrid) infrastructures exhibit limited interconnectivity with democratized banking. Moreover, DeFi's association with distributed ledger technology is negligible. In bear markets, the strongest positive associations are observed between inclusive access and conventional, hybrid, and decentralized financial systems. These insights provide new perspectives on the dynamics between financial systems during extreme conditions. This study emphasizes the need for adaptive regulation, international cooperation, and a balance between innovation and stability to protect and empower users. Collaboration between academia and policymakers is essential to navigate this evolving landscape and advance democratized banking.}

Many companies and creators have experimented with various ways to develop NFT businesses, but often without clear guidance on how NFTs shape property rights and business models. In this article, we examine the roles of NFTs in establishing digital property rights, creating value for creators and collectors, and empowering business model innovation. As NFTs unlock digital property rights, they can spawn new business models centered around digital ownership, portable and composable digital assets, and decentralized communities. We believe our framework can help businesses and creators formulate and implement actionable strategies to create and capture value in NFTs and Web3.}

abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.}

Integrating blockchain technology into decentralized FL frameworks is critical to establishing the trust necessary for user participation. However, existing FL systems using blockchain often struggle with scalability, latency, and privacy issues, particularly in permissionless blockchain contexts. This paper proposes OpenFL, a novel, collateral-backed reputation system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This system aims to foster trust among participants in a decentralized FL environment. We present a fully autonomous smart contract platform specifically tailored to facilitate FL processes among anonymous users. Furthermore, we address potential security concerns by detailing our strategies to mitigate various attack vectors. To validate our system’s efficacy, we conducted experiments on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our findings demonstrate OpenFL’s capability to overcome the inherent limitations of permissionless blockchains while highlighting the significance of open-access protocols in this context. OpenFL can potentially broaden the participant base in trust-sensitive applications by reducing entry barriers, thus substantially contributing to decentralized machine learning.}

Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms. To effectively leverage decentralized trust as a novel aspect of competitive actions, business leaders must pursue Web3 technologies that are reliable, high-growth market segments that are credible, and ventures that are investable.}

For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities. Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity, accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution.}

Blockchain is a potential technology that can resolve most of these issues, however, it is difficult to find an appropriate consensus protocol applicable to crowdsourcing systems. Therefore, this work presents a Trust and Transactions Chain (TTC) consensus protocol built upon blockchain technology. It selects a trusted leader and validators considering a trust model which depends on deposit ratio, block generation and validation rate, and waiting rate. The TTC protocol addresses the main challenge of ensuring correctness related to critical systems of crowdsourcing which has extreme significance as their failure can result in disastrous consequences. This work is primarily focused on fraud-resilience avoiding double-spending attack. It also deals with sybil and eclipse attacks. Model checking is exploited because it is effective and automatic to conduct formal verification. The TTC protocol is formally modeled utilizing Communicating Sequential Programs, and the fraud-resilience property is specified using Linear Temporal Logic. The verification of the model is done using Process Analysis Toolkit that takes the formal model and specified properties as input to inspect the properties’ satisfaction or violation. The results of the formal verification are analyzed with respect to the verification time and the number of visited states.}

Based on a review of the literature in platform studies, we identify challenges and risks that “platformization” may pose for citizen science. These risks include extractivism and commodification, scaling tensions, and technological solutionism. We then present five components of the “platform ecosystem of CBWM,” which we derived following a review and analysis of methods, tools, and equipment used by CBWM groups listed on two citizen science inventories (SciStarter and CitizenScience.gov). Choices about platform uptake and design have implications not only for the kinds of data that are collected, but for the nature of the participation that they elicit from volunteer participants.}

The humanitarian sector has emerged as a powerful mechanism of legitimation for blockchain technology. Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.}

abstract = {Due to the continuous expansion of the user base and the heightened demands for quality of service (QoS), real-time data distribution has encountered significant challenges in event matching within large-scale content-based publish/subscribe (CPS) systems. Many efficient algorithms have been proposed to enhance the matching performance. However, most existing algorithms scarcely consider operation characteristics, which often leads to performance degradation due to a multitude of repetitive operations, such as comparisons, additions, and assignments. In this paper, we propose an Operation-aware Event Matching algorithm called OEM, which takes into account the efficiency of CPU operations, SIMD instructions, and multi-thread architecture. First, we introduce a bitset-based subscription cache mechanism (SCM), which enables the efficient execution of bitwise OR operations during the matching process. Furthermore, we propose two optimizations, namely an optimal skewness-aware cell grouping (OSCG) strategy and an attribute-based clustering mechanism (ACM), to enhance the efficiency of OEM. These optimizations effectively address the challenges posed by data skewness, low cache efficiency, and high dimensionality. In addition, we establish a performance analysis model that characterizes the trade-off between memory consumption and performance improvement. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of OEM. Compared to six state-of-the-art algorithms, namely REIN, Ada-REIN, TAMA, OpIndex, PEM and fgPEM, OEM achieves an average reduction in matching time by 40.4×, 38.5×, 12.0×, 33.1×, 27.8×, and 25.5×, respectively.}

Against this backdrop, we introduce data intermediaries and critically examine the DGA's related legal regime by testing its underlying assumptions and highlighting its intrinsic weaknesses and limitations as part of the broader EU data law puzzle. As a result, the paper brings to the fore certain contradictions between DGA's means and ends. Indeed, due to various questionable assumptions, the DGA imposes requirements that not all data intermediaries can satisfy and entrenches a specific techno-organisational form for data intermediation services that may turn out to be economically non-viable. Consequently, one must wonder whether the DGA's rules on data intermediaries are necessary and proportionate in light of the freedom to conduct a business. We furthermore uncover inconsistencies and loopholes between the DGA, the GDPR, the draft Data Act, and the Digital Markets Act. Overall, while the DGA's underlying efforts are laudable, its precise postulations may hinder the achievement of its underlying objectives due to two main factors. First its own internal limitations and incoherences, and, second, uncertainties and tensions resulting from its interplay with the broader EU data law framework.}

Blockchain bring many benefits to the operation of improving provenance and reliability, such as, digitizing the interaction among SC actors to allow implementation of smart contracts to support a secure and authenticated chain. In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.}

However, the owners of centralized social media platforms may engage in practices and make decisions related to (1) monetization, (2) content moderation, and (3) privacy and security, which may be detrimental to content creators’ earning potential and long-term success. This paper investigates the extent to which new types of social media platforms may address those three challenges due to their decentralized nature. Specifically, we analyze the potential and limitations of federated vs. blockchain-based social media platforms as platforms for content creators and provide recommendations for content creators. Given the role of user-generated content in the success of social media platforms, we also provide directions for research and development of decentralized social media to increase their relevance for content creators.}

Given the scarcity of understanding about the role of specific technologies enabling value creation through digital connectivity, we investigate how blockchain-based digital connectivity shapes value creation in international digital platforms and ecosystems (DPEs). Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity. Moreover, this interdisciplinary explanation reveals why certain features theoretically attributed to blockchain (e.g., decentralization, trust) do not always realize or support value creation in practice in IB based on the DPE business model.}

Once the objectives and target audience of a digital project are defined, the selection of suitable BPs is undertaken. The primary objective of this research is to develop a decision support system that aids in the selection of BPs for transferring digital data and assets. Numerous quantitative parameters determine the performance of BPs, alongside qualitative parameters indicating their performance. In this study, the aim is to determine the performance of BPs based on both qualitative and quantitative parameters. Within this scope, a multi-criteria decision-making approach and interval-valued spherical fuzzy (IVSF) sets are adopted. IVSF sets are utilized to determine expert importance levels. The IVSF-criteria importance assessment (CIMAS) method is introduced for the weighting of criteria. IVSF-CIMAS enables the determination of reliability levels in calculating criterion weights. The IVSF-simple weighted sum product (WISP) method is formulated to obtain the performance ranking of BPs. Thus, in this research, the IVSF-CIMAS-WISP hybrid model is developed, and an algorithm for this novel decision-analytic model is presented. A case study is developed focusing on BP selection for a digital project to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed hybrid model. The robustness of IVSF-CIMAS-WISP is tested through extensive sensitivity analysis scenarios. According to the research results, the applicability of the IVSF-CIMAS-WISP hybrid method is supported and its robustness is confirmed. The research findings provide numerous insights for project managers and practitioners.}

In this paper, we examine the use of metaverse for transportation and logistics operations. To be specific, we first examine the related literature by a selective critical review. Then, we discuss how the use of metaverse can facilitate transportation operations with some relevant cases such as the metaverse project of MTR (from Hong Kong). We establish an AI supported digital technological framework, called the ABCDE framework, for transportation and logistics companies to adopt with their use of metaverse. Finally, we propose and discuss several important future research areas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which comprehensively examines the use of metaverse for transportation and logistics operations. The theoretical framework also lays the foundation for future studies. The findings and insights provide constructive and helpful guidance to both practitioners and academics on the future development of the topic.}

This article examines the impact of disruptive technologies on e-diasporas in the context of data extractivism, particularly stemming from HD. The article pursues a dual objective: (i) reviewing existing literature and comparing five disruptive technologies—Blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Data Cooperatives, Metaverse, and ChatGPT—in sustaining e-diasporas as networks driven by human agency, and (ii) scrutinizing associated opportunities and risks, including challenges to institutional trust and data privacy arising from HD. The study seeks to elucidate how these technologies may either hinder or exacerbate the impacts of HD on e-diasporas, characterized by their human-driven nature. The article begins with an introduction to HD, followed by a literature review on e-diasporas. Methodologically, it presents a comparative analysis of the five disruptive technologies concerning the research question and discusses their implications for e-diasporic communities, concluding with final remarks.}

A solution is elaborated that permits the formation of organizations where participants preserve straight real-time check of contributed collects and governance policies are formalized, automatized and imposed using software. Basic code for smart contract is composed to make a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain. We also explain the working of DAOs code, centering on fundamental establishment and governance characteristics, which includes organization, formation and voting rights. DAOs are considered to agree to the expectation of the business work in the future. But there is still lack of operational base for DAOs in the blockchain community.}

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.}

This phenomenon is defining a new economy staging in so-called metaverses. Here, physical-world BMs are modified, virtual-world BMs are implemented, and combinations of physical-world and virtual-world BMs are performed. As a result, new mechanisms of value creation and value capture at the crossroads of physical and virtual economies arise in the metaverse. This paper aims at understanding which are these value mechanisms and how organizations can develop them. To this aim, the paper analyzes the cases of four cross-industry incumbents (namely, Gucci, Samsung, Hyundai, and Nike), which are pivoting their BMs in the metaverse. A framework indicating how to innovate BMs in the metaverse is provided, by looking at both “phygital” transformations (i.e., transformations aimed at joining physical and digital worlds’ realities) and completely virtual immersions shaping firms’ internal processes and relationships with customers. In this way, the paper supports companies in turning the metaverse into value, while also extends the scant academic knowledge on the metaverse’ impact on innovation of BMs.}

abstract = {Initial coin offering (ICO) is a Web-3 based financing method for ventures, which allows them to use digital assets (e.g., tokens) to raise capital. During an ICO, the entrepreneur has control on ownership; they can choose to issue a very small number of tokens which would allow them to keep “their skin in the game” and retain ownership, or issue all the tokens they hold, which would distribute ownership to investors and have a community-decentralized orientation. While previous literature has identified several factors of ICO success, they have not delved into the role of ownership in ICO success. In this study, we explore whether retaining or distributing ownership during an ICO is more beneficial for raising capital. We find a two-pronged explanation. When looking at ICOs maintaining a higher level of ownership, entrepreneurs are catering to corporate-market logic investors, and we see a U relationship where the optimal percentage in which the entrepreneurs show they have skin in the game at the same time as giving enough to investors. But then, there are ICOs distributing most of its ownership in which entrepreneurs are attracting community-oriented investors, and as such, the higher the distribution the higher the investment. We propose that this is related to how there are different investors audiences’ that will value different practices and ideals and choose differently on what types of projects to invest in. Our research elucidates this new funding source. Nonetheless, future research should investigate these exploratory findings.}

OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.}

On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.}

abstract = {Much of the discourse around fintech regulation focuses on how regulation can best facilitate private-sector innovation. However, financial regulators in the United States do not have a statutory mandate to promote private sector innovation. This Article argues that when devising approaches to regulating fintech, financial regulators should be guided by their statutory mandates – and that these mandates (even mandates for efficiency and competition) should be conceived of as instructions to prevent or mitigate public harm. This Article then uses the framework of “accommodating, taming, or coping” to assess some extant fintech regulatory strategies in light of how they respond to the public harm arising from some fintech business models (particularly crypto business models). This Article is critical of regulatory strategies designed to peel back existing protective regulation to accommodate private sector fintech innovation; instead, it advocates for a taming approach but recognizes that, in practice, protective regulatory responses can more accurately be described as coping. The Article concludes with an exhortation for more precautionary taming regulation of fintech technologies and business models.}

This dynamic landscape is characterized by a myriad of innovative solutions, ranging from decentralized finance and supply chain management to digital identity and voting systems, each contributing to the ongoing advancement and adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors. Achieving interoperability among these applications and platforms poses a significant challenge due to their use of distinct protocols, and remains a bottleneck hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. Addressing this challenge requires designing a universal interoperability protocol while ensuring compliance with the security and privacy constraints specific to each blockchain, thus adding complexity. We propose an agnostic interoperability protocol designed for seamless asset movement across independent private blockchain networks, regardless of their individual protocols. This protocol leverages incentive-driven smart contract and Zero-Knowledge Proofs to establish a decentralized, secure, and privacy-focused framework for interoperability. We conduct a security analysis using game theory and provide both theoretical and empirical evaluations of the protocol end-to-end delay. Through a comprehensive use case, we demonstrate the secure deployment of the proposed protocol for asset movement between two private blockchains. We also discuss the trade-offs between cost and delay in cross-blockchain transactions. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing interoperability schemes showcases the proposed interoperability scheme superiority in terms of robustness, privacy preservation, and verifiability.}

The framework is built upon classifications of tokens and the key principles of circular economy and shows how tokenization can support circularity in agri-food systems through the flows of information and flows of value. Based on an integrative review of literature on tokenization, blockchain and the circular economy and multiple case studies in the agri-food domain, we show the relevance of tokenization to the circular economy in three ways: 1) enhancing traceability of physical and digital objects in supply chains; 2) improving transparency and credibility of circularity claims; 3) facilitating collaborative business ecosystems with incentives for more circular production and distribution. Based on the framework, we derive important research questions for future research agenda on tokenizing circularity in agri-food systems.}

This exploratory research investigates why people create, trade or collect NFTs, what value they derive from them, and how online communities contribute to value co-creation. Over the course of two rounds, we interview 38 participants, most of whom are digital natives. We find that engaging with NFTs is the new form of day trading, reflecting financialization of everyday life. The value of NFTs is mainly speculative and utilitarian, and NFTs themselves are best thought of as derivatives. Value co-creation in NFT project communities is largely focused on gaining superior information about the project. We contribute to the crypto-marketing and web3 literature by advancing a novel model of NFT consumer value that extends Holbrook's (1999) typology and distinguishes both positive and negative aspects of consumer value that have been overlooked in mainstream literature. We shed light on the role of communities in an unusual setting: a nascent, illiquid, speculative, informationally opaque market for digital assets. Our study helps creators and brand managers to develop effective NFT strategies.}

abstract = {Web3 is emerging as the new Internet-interaction model that facilitates direct collaboration between strangers without a need for prior trust between network participants and without central authorities. However, one of its shortcomings is the lack of a defense mechanism against the ability of a single user to generate a surplus of identities, known as the Sybil attack. Web3 has a Sybil attack problem because it uses peer sampling to establish connections between users. We evaluate the promising but under-explored direction of Sybil avoidance using network latency measurements, according to which two identities with equal latencies are suspected to be operated from the same node, and thus are likely Sybils. Network latency measurements have two desirable properties: they are only malleable by attackers by adding latency, and they do not require any trust between network participants. Our basic SybilSys mechanism avoids Sybil attackers using only network latency measurements if attackers do not actively exploit their malleability. We present an enhanced version of SybilSys that protects against targeted attacks using a variant of the flow correlation attack, which we name TrafficJamTrigger. We show how the message flows of Round-Trip Time measurements can be used to expose attack patterns and we propose and evaluate six classifiers to recognize these patterns. Our experiments show, through both emulation and real-world deployment, that enhanced SybilSys can serve a fundamental role for Web3, effectively establishing connections to real users even in the face of networks consisting of 99% Sybils.}

These issues are often perpetuated by centralized systems and their manipulation by system administrators. Furthermore, the lack of data ownership and the monetization of user data by tech companies further increase concerns about transparency. In light of these concerns, this study aims to review existing blockchain-based governance models and identify best-practice governance models focusing on corruption transparency, their characteristics, and components. The research will also examine the role of a token economy in addressing trusted third-party issues related to asset ownership management. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of smart contracts, blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Web 3.0, and multifactor challenge set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFSSIA) as modern technologies to combat corruption and achieve transparency in the public sector. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) comprising peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters published between 2012 and 2023. Using the SLR methodology, 45 primary and supporting studies have been selected for result extraction and analysis. Finally, we discovered seven blockchain-based governance models with their characteristics and primary components.}

It explores effective strategies to address the challenges mentioned above, with the aim of enhancing integration and application approaches. (1) Utilizing a graphical model-driven solution for the visualization and configuration of manufacturing resources on the front end, creating a BPMN-driven orchestration diagram and an off-chain/on-chain interoperability model for manufacturing smart contracts, and investigating voting mechanisms and customization methods specific to smart contracts in workshop manufacturing; (2) The two-layer monitoring model based on blockchain 3.0 and Tangle-based verification backend is established by introducing Cached DTs to implement negotiation of smart contracts based on BPMN constraints at the upper level, and supporting device node expansion and verification mechanisms at the lower level, thereby realizing swift synchronization and comprehensive visualization across the entire manufacturing lifecycle; (3) Based on multiple open-source technologies, a decentralized intelligent workshop case that relies on distributed information management is constructed. The comprehensive experimental results underscore the technical superiority of the proposed system architecture.}

Web3 describes a broad range of emerging internet applications for blockchain technology (i.e., a decentralized, public database that allows information to be securely recorded on a network of computers rather than verified and controlled by centralized entities). Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices. We conclude by addressing how established companies can prepare for a more decentralized internet.}

The concept originated initially as a token standard of Ethereum, an open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, where each token is characterized by distinguishable signs. These types of tokens have unique digital properties that allow their distinct identification. NFTs, with their distinct qualities, can be fluidly traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, and liquidity. The trading of NFTs has heavily influenced the growth of the decentralized application (dApp) marketplace, as exponential returns (thousand folds from their original value) on its ever-expanding market are being observed, leading to worldwide attention. However, the NFT ecosystem is in its nascence, and the associated technologies are still in their infancy. New researchers might be fascinated with the exponential, yet nebulous evolution of NFTs; however, this novelty has contributed to the paucity of systematic and conclusive published research work on this topic. This review portrays the NFT ecosystem multidimensionally, wherein the paper commences with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT technology and furnishes summary standards and desired properties. Finally, the study concludes with an elaborate discussion of the future outlook for and prime challenges faced by NFTs.}
