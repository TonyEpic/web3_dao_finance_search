abstract = {Traditional medical prescriptions based on physical paper-based documents are prone to manipulation, errors, and unauthorized reproduction due to their format. Addressing the limitations of the traditional prescription system, e-prescription systems have been introduced in several countries. However, e-prescription systems lead to several concerns like the risk of privacy loss, the problem of double-spending prescriptions, lack of interoperability, and single point of failure, all of which need to be addressed immediately. We propose an AI-assisted blockchain-enabled smart and secure e-prescription management framework to address these issues. Our proposed system overcomes the problems of the centralized e-prescription systems and enables efficient consent management to access prescriptions by incorporating blockchain-based smart contracts. Our work incorporates the Umbral proxy re-encryption scheme in the proposed system, avoiding the need for repeated encryption and decryption of the prescriptions when transferred between different entities in the network. In our work, we employ two different machine learning models(Random Forest classifier and LightGBM classifier) to assist the doctor in prescribing medicines. One is a drug recommendation model, which is aimed at providing drug recommendations considering the medical history of the patients and the general prescription pattern for the particular ailment of the patient. We have fine-tuned the SciBERT model for adverse drug reaction detection. The extensive experimentation and results show that the proposed e-prescription framework is secure, scalable, and interoperable. Further, the proposed machine learning models produce results higher than 95\%.},

abstract = {Through digital transformation, lots of personal data are captured, but individuals often do not have ownership or control over them. This results in the emerging Web 3.0, where people demand data sovereignty. There are actually two conceptually related terms, data sovereignty and digital sovereignty. This paper first explains these two concepts in terms of their points of focus, guiding principles, laws and regulations requirements, and then analyses the requirements and technical challenges of their implementation. To understand the emerging trend shift in digital sovereignty towards individuals taking control of security and privacy preserving over their own digital assets, this paper conducts a systematic review and analysis on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is a user-centric decentralized model and autonomy for an individual to self-determine the access and use of one's identity and credentials. The review covers existing SSI solutions and points out that an efficient key management system, the scalability and interoperability of the solution, and a well-established standard are some of the challenges for SSI deployment. Finally, the paper concludes with open issues about digital identity, including dynamic attributes, persona, and attribute ownership, that challenge the current reference architecture of SSI as well as its implementation.},

abstract = {Contemporary societies face many urban issues. To address these issues, governments, corporations and individuals should disclose and share their related statistical and sensory data. However, existing published data appear in various formats and contain defects. Therefore, few problems have been solved using these data. In this research, we sought to address this problem, by considering a university campus as a microcosm of society, designed data integration schema, and consolidated data into a knowledge graph. We then, applied and modified existing completion methods. In particular, regarding the bicycle environment, we trained our knowledge graph and evaluated it with the conventional method and our proposed derivative method, respectively. Using approximately 650 parking data with various dates and times, our method correctly estimated 54.5 more bicycles than the conventional method by comparing each time's mean absolute error.},

abstract = {User migration, i.e. the movement of large sets of users from one online social platform to another one, is one of the main phenomena occurring in modern online social networks and even involves the most recent alternative paradigms of online social networks, such as blockchain online social networks (BOSNs). In these platforms, user migration mainly occurs through hard forks of the supporting blockchain, i.e. a split of the original blockchain and the creation of an alternative blockchain, to which users may decide to migrate. However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

abstract = {The ecosystem inherent within currently deployed Internet of Things (IoT) systems is that of low-powered devices equipped with sensors that consume data. The data these devices collect is then stored in use-case specific applications, which are connected through application layer gateways that allow these devices to connect to third party cloud storage platforms for further processing. This stratified architecture has created data silos that introduce complexities such as limited user control and lack of solicitation regarding the usage of user data. The constant proliferation of IoT devices deployed in smart cities which include smart university campus (SUC) has resulted in the need for the development of IoT architecture models which are data-centric. In this paper a blockchain- based architecture model, and specifically, the distributed ledger inherent within the Ethereum blockchain, combined with the Proof Of Authority (POA) consensus mechanism, are proposed as a potential solution to developing a proof of concept architecture model that is data-centric. The proposed architecture model will be tested against with application specific use-cases in a simulated environment within the context of a SUC which is subsumed by a smart city.},

Our approach Author-Topic-Time model (ATT) addresses this problem by means of Bayesian modeling of relations between authors, latent topics and temporal information. We extend state of the art Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to incorporate the author and timestamp information for capturing changes in user interest over time with respect to evolving latent topics. We present results of application of the model to the 9 years of scientific publication datasets from CiteSeer showing improved semantically cohesive topic detection and capturing shift in authors interest in relation to topic evolution. We also discuss opportunities of model use in novel mining and recommendation scenarios.},

This study provides an in-depth analysis of NFT rug pulls, the fraudulent schemes that steal investors’ funds. From a curated dataset of 760 rug pulls across 10 NFT marketplaces, we examine these schemes’ structural and behavioral properties, identify the characteristics and motivations of rug pullers, and classify NFT projects into 20 groups based on creators’ association with their accounts. Our findings reveal that repeated rug pulls account for a significant proportion of the rise in NFT-related cryptocurrency crimes, with one NFT creator attempting 37 rug pulls within 3 months. Additionally, we identify the largest group of creators influencing the majority of rug pulls and demonstrate the connection between rug pullers of different NFT projects using the same wallets to store and move money. Our study contributes to understanding NFT market risks and provides insights for designing preventative strategies to mitigate future losses.},

abstract = {The goal of the TeSLA project is to create mutual trust between learners, teachers and an institution, which provides distance learning. It is achieved through the incorporation and widespread use of innovative information and communication technologies (ICT) tools for the purpose of assessment activities in the educational process at higher education institutions and its transformation into e-assessment. In this ambitious project five technological tools (face recognition, voice recognition, writing style analysis, typing rhythm, plagiarism analysis) have been developed and piloted at seven universities. Their role for mutually trusted assessment in the educational process is discussed. Assessment activities in typical engineering subjects are shown. It is pointed out that assessment functions are management functions with a key decision making role. Pilot studies within the TeSLA project have shown additional effects leading to the expansion of its application areas. This synergy effect is shown to appear in increasing the degree of automation and improving the quality of the overall learning process, integration with other subject areas in the context of interoperability, achieving higher degree of security and protection of personal data.},

abstract = {Access control languages are traditionally based on centralized trust models when achieving their security goals. One important reason for a lack of decentralized trust models for access control has been difficulties in referring to and accessing cryptographic key material in a decentralized fashion. This lack of a working and secure decentralized public key infrastructure could be fatal for projects like Berners-Lee’s Solid. To solve this problem, we propose repurposing the access control scheme SDSI (Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure). SDSI is a long-standing and well-studied alternative to the hierarchical PKI infrastructure, but it failed to be adopted due to problems with key discovery and revocation, both of which can be solved with blockchain technology. In this concept note, we outline the next steps for how SDSI could be used as a decentralized trust model using blockchain technology.},

However, to accomplish this, one big problem that emerged and outscored everything else was catering to the day to day necessary items of the people without human involvement. In this regard, we propose a blockchain-enabled secure communication framework for delivering the goods in COVID-19 like scenarios by leveraging the drones that are available with commercial retail providers. The blockchain scheme is used to create smart contracts to build the trust of buyers and sellers on the framework as the payments are made through the smart contract executions. The blockchain based order processing ensures the integrity and authenticity of the information. Moreover, a communication model is presented along with the order, delivery and payment phases. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by evaluating it based on gas price, transaction time, and mining time.},

abstract = {In the past, the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)” was used to refer to a loosely organized network of autonomous entities, such as a corporation, a cooperative, or a non-profit party. Since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs. The EVM can also run other applications such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a new type of blcokchain-based organization that uses smart contracts to perform tasks on a distributed scale. The smart contracts have organizational rules and operational logic embedded and automatically execute organizational decisions and proposals making it highly decentralized and more democratic. The DAOs are organizations that are not subject to legal, physical, or economic constraints, as well as the ability to operate outside the control of a single central authority or a single governing body. Because DAO is formed by many smart contract that operate together, which makes it highly decentralized and has a strong democratic system. This paper discusses the pros and cons of DAO, and the potential of DAO in community development, especially in non-profit organizations. It is hope to provide an overall picture of DAO, and the roadmap for future development of DAO on the right track.},

abstract = {In recent years, edge-based smart unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery systems have attracted a lot of attention by both academia and industry given its promising business value and also as an ideal testbed for many emerging technologies such as edge computing, blockchain and machine learning. At the moment, one of the critical challenges for smart UAV delivery systems is data privacy since the massive amount of data is being generated by both users and UAVs and the data is used for training machine learning models to support various smart applications such as autonomous navigation, facial recognition, and person re-identification (ReID). To tackle such a challenge, federated learning (FL) has been widely used as a promising solution since it only needs to share and update model parameters with the centralised server without transmitting the raw data. However, conventional FL still faces the issue of the single-point-of-failure. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose BDFL, a Blockchain-enabled decentralised FL framework for edge-based smart UAV delivery systems. In our framework, Blockchain provides a decentralised network for FL to eliminate the need for a centralised server and store private data in the decentralised permissioned Blockchain to avoid the single-point-of-failure. To motivate our study and analyse the privacy concerns, we employ the person ReID application in smart UAV delivery systems as a typical example. In addition, we also provide the customised proof of quality factor (cPoQF) consensus protocol to address the scalability issue of the Blockchain in order to support the increasing number of smart applications in UAV delivery system. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through experiments on energy efficiency, confirmation time and throughput, with further discussion on the impact of the incentive mechanism, and the analysis of its resiliency under various security attacks.},

Therefore, the applications that rely on them will eventually need to migrate from one blockchain instance to another to remain competitive and secure, as well as to enhance the business process, performance, cost efficiency, privacy, and regulatory compliance. However, the differences in data and smart contract representations, modes of hosting, transaction fees, as well as the need to preserve consistency, immutability, and data provenance introduce unique challenges over database migration. We first present a set of blockchain migration scenarios and data fidelity levels using an illustrative example. We then present a set of migration patterns to address those scenarios and the above data management challenges. Finally, we demonstrate how the effort, cost, and risk of migration could be minimized by choosing a suitable set of data migration patterns, data fidelity level, and proactive system design. Practical considerations and research challenges are also highlighted.},

abstract = {The study and preservation of ancient texts presents unique challenges due to the degradation and damage these manuscripts often exhibit. Papyrology, specifically, relies on meticulous study and reconstruction of fragmented texts by experts. Current digital platforms for editing and publishing papyrological texts lack the ability to manage the complex components of critical editions while facilitating peer review. In our work we propose a novel framework utilizing blockchain and smart contracts to automate the storage and retrieval of multiple related editions of a text while ensuring contributions by multiple authors are recorded. The system architecture consists of a user interface for submitting editions, a smart contract that manages storage, the blockchain ledger which stores data locations, and the use of the decentralized storage platform, the Interplanetary Files System (IPFS). Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the framework by storing 501 synthetic editions on IPFS and recording metrics for encoding, transmission time, blockchain transaction time, and transaction costs. We believe this novel framework could enable the advancement of digital papyrology through distributed peer review and allow for the integration of AI agents into papyrology. Future development of the proposed platform could significantly modernize digital edition management for papyrology and the humanities in general.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is a new way to compute in the cloud that further simplifies the user's management burden and allows the user to focus on its core business. Most existing FaaS systems are centralized, i.e., the infrastructure is owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. This character brings a few limitations. For instance, an end user will be bound with a specific cloud service provider and there is a risk of single point of failure. In order to mitigate these limitations, a natural idea is to build a decentralized FaaS system. In this paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system that uses blockchain technology and decentralized API management to build a decentralized FaaS system, which enables greater scalability, flexibility, improved security, and reliability. Specifically, DeFaaS uses a blockchain to create a decentralized registry of available functions (services) and manage their execution. An application interacts with the blockchain to discover and invoke functions securely and transparently. In addition to providing a reliable and scalable platform for decentralized FaaS, DeFaaS can support other distributed computing scenarios, such as dApps, volunteer computing, and multi-cloud service mesh. Overall, our proposed system represents a significant advance in the field of decentralized computing and has the potential to enable a wide range of exciting new applications and use cases.},

abstract = {Blockchain is an emerging technology that has piqued the interest of researchers and industry today. Following the success of this technology in the financial market with virtual currencies, blockchain begins to be used by different domains such as government and education as it provides a reliable, scalable and unchanging distributed environment for conducting and storing transactions on a network. Higher education is a system with many challenges that could be solved by adopting this technology. Protecting data transactions that involve student degrees is one of the challenges considered by educational institutions. Thus, this paper presents a reference architecture proposal based on blockchain technology and a proof of concept to register and consult student certificates issued by higher education institutions. With this architecture, we intend to evaluate a new business model in this technology applied to the educational domain. As a proof of concept, we presented a prototype implementation using smart contracts based on the Ethereum platform and an evaluation made by experts in high education.},

Digital copies of physical documents cannot be trusted. The current verification process is inefficient, time consuming, and expensive, causing many delays and difficulties for the Human Resources. To address this problem, we propose Truver, a blockchain based platform which (a) provides a distributed and secure system on which every individual can store his/her verified credentials and share them with all potential employers, and (b) allows employers to verify an applicant's credentials instantaneously.The real world tests, using Ethereum blockchain, illustrates that Truver runs in acceptable cost and time.

Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures, and systems related to economic systems. When investigating those state-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in mind: (1) What is the framework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse? and (2) What activities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to disclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and the future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic system framework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements in the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital trading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed economic system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary systems, digital wallets, decentralized finance activities, and cross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly discuss three questions: (a) the rationale of this topic, (b) why the metaverse needs this topic, and (c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through this overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the metaverse needs and the insights behind the economic activities in the metaverse.},

abstract = {Although China has initially entered the era of comprehensive well-off by 2020, there are still many remote rural areas in China that are lagging behind in development and the living standards of farmers are below the poverty line. Local governments at all levels, enterprises and institutions actively respond to the national policy of targeted poverty alleviation (TPA), through precise counterpart support, promotion and sales of agricultural products, to achieve the purpose of helping farmers in remote areas to get rid of poverty. In order to further tap the poverty alleviation potential of the whole society and accelerate the goal of poverty alleviation, this paper proposes and designs a Consumer to Farmer (C2F) platform, based on "decentralized" blockchain technology, to build a direct link between consumers and farmers. By adopting the form of multi-nodes to build a federation chain, and at the same time combining smart contract technology to design and develop a decentralizedblockchain-based TPA platform. Through the roadmap of consumers purchasing and paying in advance for agricultural products, farmers produce and deliver the ordered agricultural products, achieving a win-win outcome for both consumers and farmers. The C2F platform is therefore of great relevance as a complement to government-led TPA.},

abstract = {Bug bounty programmes and vulnerability disclosure programmes, collectively referred to as Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) programmes, open up an organisation’s assets to the inquisitive gaze of (often eager) white-hat hackers. Motivated by the question What information do organisations convey to hackers through public CVD policy documents?, we aim to better understand the information available to hackers wishing to participate in the search for vulnerabilities. As such, in this article we consider three key issues. First, to address the differences in the legal language communicated to hackers, it is necessary to understand the formal constraints by which hackers must abide. Second, it is beneficial to understand the variation that exists in the informal constraints that are communicated to hackers through a variety of institutional elements. Third, for organisations wishing to better understand the commonplace elements that form current policy documents, we offer broad analysis of the components frequently included therein and identify gaps in programme policies.We report the results of a quantitative study, leveraging deep learning based natural language processing models, providing insights into the policy documents that accompany the CVD programmes of thousands of organisations, covering both stand-alone programmes and those hosted on 13 bug bounty programmes. We found that organisations often inadequately convey the formal constraints that are applicable to hackers, requiring hackers to have a deep understanding of the laws that underpin safe and legal security research. Furthermore, a lack of standardisation across similar policy components is prevalent, and may lead to a decreased understanding of the informal constraints placed upon hackers when searching for and disclosing vulnerabilities. Analysis of the institutional elements included in the policy documents of organisations reveals insufficient inclusion of many key components. Namely, legal information and information pertaining to restrictions on the backgrounds of hackers is found to be absent in a majority of policies analysed. Finally, to assist ongoing research, we provide novel annotated policy datasets that include human-labelled annotations at both the sentence and paragraph level, covering a broad range of CVD programme backgrounds.},

abstract = {Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.},

Non-fungible tokens are a recent example, as they allow a decentralized way to generate and verify proof of ownership via distributed ledger technology. Despite crucial uncertainties, these tokens have generated great enthusiasm for the future of digital property and its surrounding economy. In this regard, I think there is an untapped opportunity in applying a hypertext approach to augment such highly structured ownership-based associations. To this end, in this work I propose hyperownership, based on the premises that property is the law of lists and ledgers, and that hypertext is an apt method to inquiry such a ledger system. In spite of the significant risks and challenges to realize such a vision, I believe that it has great potential to transform the way with which we interact with digital property.},

Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

abstract = {Blockchain and smart contracts are one of the key technologies promoting Web 3.0. However, due to security considerations and consistency requirements, smart contracts currently only support simple and deterministic programs, which significantly hinders their deployment in intelligent Web 3.0 applications. To enhance smart contracts intelligence on the blockchain, we propose SMART, a plug-in smart contract framework that supports efficient AI model inference while being compatible with existing blockchains. To handle the high complexity of model inference, we propose an on-chain and off-chain joint execution model, which separates the SMART contract into two parts: the deterministic code still runs inside an on-chain virtual machine, while the complex model inference is offloaded to off-chain compute nodes. To solve the non-determinism brought by model inference, we leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to endorse the integrity and correctness of the off-chain execution. We also design distributed attestation and secret key provisioning schemes to further enhance the system security and model privacy. We implement a SMART prototype and evaluate it on a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchain. Theoretical analysis and prototype evaluation show that SMART not only achieves the security goals of correctness, liveness, and model privacy, but also has approximately 5 orders of magnitude faster inference efficiency than existing on-chain solutions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a crypto Non Fungible Token (NFT) for real estate information. Current issues with real estate are the lack of asset information availability, and once data is retrieved, its veracity. Moreover, data can be out of data or artificially manipulated for an economic benefit. An example could be the fire alarm inspection logs. On the other hand, the main benefits of tokenisation are 1) decentralisation from a single source of authority, 2) encryption of data that avoids tampering, and 3) digital proof of ownership. The NFT registers real estate static and dynamic information to be traded in the data marketplace between the different users and stakeholders such as investors, occupiers, insurers and property managers. The information registered in the NFT contains real estate deeds, transactions and relevant parameters that change over time. The infrastructure of the proposed real estate NFT consists of a private token in a private blockchain entirely developed for this application rather than ERC-1155 or ERC-721; therefore, a new crypto token is created. Furthermore, the consensus protocol is a mixture between the proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms by choosing random validators with staked Cryptocurrency already, such as Ethereum. Experimental results show that the increment of the NFT at every transaction does not produce an equal increment of mining time or mining nonce, making the NFT predictable for higher complex models.},

abstract = {The emergence of new technologies and software engineering methodologies in the decentralised Web, referred to as Web 3.0, often requires using new approaches to supplement conventional development concepts such as object-oriented programming and design patterns. Therefore, it is essential to understand the blockchain fundamentals and modular development of distributed systems built from multiple components. This paper proposes a project-oriented teaching approach of smart contracts-based distributed applications (dApps) integrated into existing (Web 2.0) Web applications. First, we present the main overview of the Web programming course for a bachelor study program, prior knowledge requirements, and the characteristics of the lectures. Second, we define the dApp functional requirements for student projects that intend to consolidate the dApp theoretical concepts with a practical approach to complement the Web 3.0 concepts. The study of our teaching approach is based on an experiment where we thoroughly analyse performance on the course level, projects and individual students. The results indicate a high correlation between students' performance in Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 development, and a higher degree of iterative process is also associated with better-performing students. Moreover, the student project outcomes also provide a basis for possible future course improvements.},

Since 2020, DeFi has started to develop in the cryptocurrency markets. Then, with the increase in popularity of digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and with the launch of the Metaverse, DeFi has been introduced into the Social environment by the combination of social networking and finance in the blockchain. This new shape of DeFi has been called Social Finance (SocialFi). SocialFi can be seen as the social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing to get monetary benefits from being part of SocialFi platforms. In detail, SocialFi has a special feature that is decentralized, open and user-controlled, and it started to be adopted by the communities. The main component of SocialFi is the Social token used to reward people. In this paper, we describe in detail the concept of SocialFi, and we discuss its application on future Social Media platforms.},

abstract = {The prosperity of Ethereum attracts many users to send transactions and trade crypto assets. However, this has also given rise to a new form of transaction-based phishing scam, named TxPhish. Specifically, tempted by high profits, users are tricked into visiting fake websites and signing transactions that enable scammers to steal their crypto assets. The past year has witnessed 11 large-scale TxPhish incidents causing a total loss of more than 70 million.In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of TxPhish on Ethereum, encompassing the process of a TxPhishTxPhish campaign and details of phishing transactions. To detect TxPhish websites and extract phishing accounts automatically, we present TxPhish, which dynamically visits the suspicious websites, triggers transactions, and simulates results. Between November 25, 2022, and July 31, 2023, we successfully detected and reported 26,333 TxPhish websites and 3,486 phishing accounts. Among all of documented TxPhish websites, 78.9\% of them were first reported by us, making TxPhish the largest TxPhish website detection system. Moreover, we provided criminal evidence of four phishing accounts and their fund flow totaling 1.5 million to aid in the recovery of funds for the victims. In addition, we identified bugs in six Ethereum projects and received appreciation.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a disruptive technology that offers a secure decentralized network, allowing for direct transactions between distributed entities, without the need for a trusted third party. Smart contracts are executable codes hosted on the blockchain which enables the implementation of several decentralized applications, in different domains. Due to the complexity of the contract's construction, it is necessary to seek ways to facilitate and make this innovative development process robust. This paper presents Gifflar, a framework for generating smart contract code on the fly, in such a way that it allows a system to write, compile and implement blockchain contracts with a decentralized application still running. The framework is structured in components that implement design patterns to better define the responsibility of each one of the parts and exports a simple interaction module for modeling contracts in JSON and automatic code writing using the TypeScript language. As far as we know, this framework is one of the first to allow contract code generation dynamically at run time. Thus, the work contributes to the state of the art by addressing a new paradigm, where systems can act as smart contract developers.},

abstract = {Traceability is one of the most sought-after properties for supply chains because it facilitates a plethora of use cases like food recalls, counterfeit detection, and quality improvement by tracing the history of a product. Recently proposed traceability solutions rely heavily on blockchain technology because it offers data immutability and transparency. However, these solutions suffer from two significant limitations. Firstly, they do not validate traceability data for accuracy and completeness. So, how can we be sure that the data on the blockchain is correct and complete? Secondly, they provide a limited threat model or none at all. So, how can we be sure that the trace for a product has not been altered by an adversary? To summarise, we propose ForTrac, an Ethereum-based forward traceability system for generic physical products. Each product is digitally represented as an ERC-721 token. In a forward traceability system, traces are built correctly by design. ForTrac uses a valid predicate that states the sequence of steps a product has to follow and how much time each step can maximally take. We show that ForTrac is secure. Unlike previous work, our security analysis is not restricted to only the blockchain component. It also includes the communication protocol between the product reader, server, and smart contract. We show that our communication protocol guarantees data agreement between the reader and smart contract using Scyther. Finally, we demonstrate that our prototype is feasible by assessing costs and performance. By using forward traceability and including a detailed security analysis we provide accuracy and completeness. Our valid predicate documents which events have to be collected for a trace to be complete. Data accuracy is provided by showing that the smart contract agrees with the data sent by the reader.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged individuals and all international collaborations, including research and academic international conferences. Most conferences had to adapt to an online or hybrid mode at best, if not cancelled or postponed. During this period, we were invited to organise the third edition of an international conference on Arts, Technology and Society. At its core, it is an academic conference, but it also offers a platform for an art exhibition and forum for artists to share and exhibit. Due to Macao's physical constraints and its inaccessibility for outside visitors, the Local Organising Committee took the challenge to organise the first virtual art exhibition in an academic conference, including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) for artists willing to sell their digital artwork. This paper presents the creative process as well as the technical issues faced during the conference and exhibition preparation time. As NFT-based virtual exhibition is a new offer within an academic international conference and a new tool to permanently promote artists’ work, we are also proposing some possible future works to develop further this approach and give it a larger visibility. We believe such type of exhibition can play an important role on a world seeking for more sustainable communication.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a complex network comprising interconnected devices that transmit their data via the Internet. Due to their open environment, limited computation power, and absence of built-in security, IoT environments are susceptible to various cyberattacks. Denial of service (DDoS) attacks are among the most destructive types of threats. The Multi-vector DDoS attack is a contemporary and formidable form of DDoS wherein the attacker employs a collection of compromised IoT devices as zombies to initiate numerous DDoS attacks against a target server. A Blockchain-based Operational Threat Intelligence framework, OTI-IoT, is proposed in this article to counter multi-vector DDoS attacks in IoT networks. A “Prevent-then-Detect” methodology was utilized to deploy the OTI-IoT framework in two distinct stages. During Phase 1, the consortium Blockchain network validators employ the IPS module, composed of a smart contract for attack prevention and access control, and Proof of Voting consensus, to thwart attacks. Validators are outfitted with deep learning-based IDS instances to detect multi-vector DDoS attacks during Phase 2. Alert messages are generated by the IDS module’s alert generation and propagation smart contract in response to identifying malicious IoT sources. The feedback loop from the IDS module to the IPS module prevents incoming traffic from malicious sources. The proposed OTI framework capabilities are realized as an outcome of combining and storing the outcomes of the IDS and IPS modules on the consortium Blockchain. Each validator maintains a shared ledger containing information regarding threat sources to ensure robust security, transparency, and integrity. The operational execution of OTI-IoT occurs on an individual Ethereum Blockchain. The empirical findings indicate that our proposed framework is most suitable for real-time applications due to its ability to lower attack detection time, decreased block validation time, and higher attack prevention rate.},

abstract = {Since the emergence of Ethereum, blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps) have become increasingly popular and important. To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework, \DH{}Archer, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have evaluated \DH{}Archer on 11 popular real-world DApps. \DH{}Archer achieves high precision (99.3\%), recall (87.6\%), and accuracy (89.4\%) in bug detection and significantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs in the 11 DApps. So far, six of the 15 bugs have been confirmed by the developers, and three have been fixed. These promising results demonstrate the usefulness of \DH{}Archer.},

The novelty of our framework is that it relies only on transaction metadata and balance data from the blockchain system; our approach requires no domain knowledge, code instrumentation, or special execution environment. Dynamit extracts features from transaction data and uses a machine learning model to classify transactions as benign or harmful. Therefore, not only can we find the contracts that are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, but we also get an execution trace that reproduces the attack. Using a random forest classifier, our model achieved more than 90 percent accuracy on 105 transactions, showing the potential of our technique.},

abstract = {Every recruitment process usually starts with shortlisting candidates based on the skills mentioned in their resumes. Candidates may try to boost their level of expertise on their resume to appear more qualified to employers, and in order to confirm their skills and experience, the company’s HR staff tries to contact the candidate’s former employers. However, this process is laborious and not very thorough. As a result, the candidates’ exaggerated remarks about their skills on resumes may result in poor hires, ultimately leading to a financial and reputational loss for the company. Therefore, in order to revamp the existing workflow, an automated system is required for skill verification in the recruitment process, which guarantees an effective hiring process in the company. In this research work, a novel system is devised and implemented for automatically verifying employees’ skills with the help of Smart Contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain. The major contribution of the proposed system is that it allows the registered companies to monitor their employees and their skills. Furthermore, the proposed system will benefit the employees registering into the system to get their skills endorsed and experiences approved. Due to the need for achieving consensus in Blockchain technology, it is harder to make fraudulent profiles. By leveraging the security and decentralization offered by blockchain technology, the companies can evaluate the skills as well as experiences of the candidates before hiring them and be sure about the information verified by the candidate’s former employers.},

They inform how individuals adopt particular products and services. This elusiveness of value creates a challenge for designers to gauge users’ value preferences, which are personal, contextual and abstract. We propose deliberation as a process to operationalise design for elicitation, reflection and value formation, using Live Action Role Play (LARP). The paper demonstrates how our deliberative LARP precipitates the otherwise ethereal data values to unfold in a social setting. We argue that engaging people in reflecting on and playing out their own value formation offers designers more powerful insights to address complex challenges of data-driven societies. We report on our findings that agency and negotiability are key to transcend the politics of preferences in data practices and thus enhance acceptability.},

In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.},
