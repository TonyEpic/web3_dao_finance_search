  abstract={Empowered by blockchain and Web3 technologies, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are able to redefine resources, production relations, and organizational structures in a revolutionary manner. This article aims to reanalyze DAOs from the perspectives of organization and operation, and provide a more precise definition of DAOs as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations. Based on this, the fundamental principles and requirements of DAOs are explained, while the infrastructure based on cyber–physical–social system (CPSS) and parallel intelligence, as well as the supporting technologies, such as digital twins, metaverse, and Web3, are discussed. Besides, a five-layer intelligent architecture is presented, and the closed-loop equation and new function-oriented intelligent algorithms are also proposed. Moreover, the governance mechanisms from the individual, organizational and social perspectives are discussed, and the incentive mechanisms for the human, robot, and digital human are analyzed. This article can be regarded as a stepping stone for further research and developments of DAOs.},

  abstract={The emergence of Web3 technologies has led to the development of decentralized funding platforms, which allow individuals and organizations to raise funds without the need for intermediaries such as banks and venture capitalists. The underlying technology powering these platforms is blockchain, known for its ability to offer a reliable and transparent method of recording transactions and overseeing financial operations. This research paper aims to explore the Web3 funding platform landscape, its benefits and challenges, and the potential impact it could have on traditional funding models. The paper also examines the key features and functionalities of these platforms, including smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized governance. It also presents the design and development of a platform for investors to invest in startups using cryptocurrencies. The platform is designed to address the challenges faced by startups in accessing funding, while providing investors with new investment opportunities in the fast-growing world of cryptocurrencies. Through a review of relevant literature and case studies, this research paper provides insights into the current state of Web3 funding platforms, their adoption and growth trajectory, and the regulatory environment that surrounds them. Overall, the platform offers a new investment opportunity for investors, while also providing startups with access to much-needed funding. The platform has the potential to disrupt traditional funding models and provide a more efficient and transparent way for startups to access funding.},

  abstract={The advent of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous innovations in online governance, with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) emerging as a prominent development, often referred to as “digital jurisdictions.” Despite experiencing remarkable growth, currently boasting nearly 7M users and   ${\$}$  18 billion in assets, DAOs remain relatively underexplored in the existing literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

  abstract={The new generation of digital intelligence technology enables knowledge creation, dissemination, and application to undergoing parallel changes. Scientific systems face an increasingly uncertain, diverse, and complex environment, making adopting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches to research issues inevitable. Existing scientific systems follow linear value streams, leading to problems, such as inefficiency, unfairness, and knowledge monopoly. Decentralized science (DeSci) is a new scientific development paradigm based on Web3, Metaverses, and decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs) technologies, that can solve organizational and management problems in scientific systems through organizing, coordinating, and executing techniques. However, new economic theories and methods are still needed to effectively solve the problem of linear value flow in scientific systems. Metaeconomics based on the parallel intelligence theory, also known as decentralized economics (DeEco), provides a new approach and idea for redesigning the economic system of scientific markets. Thus, this article proposes a research framework and core mechanisms of DeSci MetaMarkets based on parallel economic theory to provide effective and practical methodologies for scientific system governance.},

  title={Exploring Downvoting in Blockchain-based Online Social Media Platforms},

  abstract={In recent years, Blockchain-based Online Social Media (BOSM) platforms have evolved fast due to the advancement of blockchain technology. BOSM can effectively overcome the problems of traditional social media platforms, such as a single point of trust and insufficient incentives for users, by combining a decentralized governance structure and a cryptocurrency-based incentive model, thereby attracting a large number of users and making it a crucial component of Web3. BOSM allows users to downvote low-quality content and aims to decrease the visibility of low-quality content by sorting and filtering it through downvoting. However, this feature may be maliciously exploited by some users to undermine the fairness of the incentive, reduce the quality of highly visible content, and further reduce users’ enthusiasm for content creation and the attractiveness of the platform. In this paper, we study and analyze the downvoting behavior using four years of data collected from Steemit, the largest BOSM platform. We discovered that a significant number of bot accounts were actively downvoting content. In addition, we discovered that roughly 9% of the downvoting activity might be retaliatory. We did not detect any significant instances of downvoting on content for a specific topic. We believe that the findings in this paper will facilitate the future development of user behavior analysis and incentive pattern design in BOSM and Web3.},
