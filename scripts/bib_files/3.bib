abstract = {Web3, based on blockchain technology, is the evolving next generation Internet of value. Massive active applications on Web3, e.g. DeFi and NFT, usually rely on blockchain transactions to achieve value transfer as well as complex and diverse custom logic and intentions. Various risky or illegal behaviors such as financial fraud, hacking, money laundering are currently rampant in the blockchain ecosystem, and it is thus important to understand the intent behind the pseudonymous transactions. To reveal the intent of transactions, much effort has been devoted to extracting some particular transaction semantics through specific expert experiences. However, the limitations of existing methods in terms of effectiveness and generalization make it difficult to extract diverse transaction semantics in the rapidly growing and evolving Web3 ecosystem. In this paper, we propose the Motif-based Transaction Semantics representation method (MoTS), which can capture the transaction semantic information in the real-time transaction data workflow. To the best of our knowledge, MoTS is the first general semantic extraction method in Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Experimental results show that MoTS can effectively distinguish different transaction semantics in real-time, and can be used for various downstream tasks, giving new insights to understand the Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Our codes are available at https://github.com/wuzhy1ng/MoTS.},

abstract = {The social network Twitter possesses a key characteristic: it is centralized, allowing Twitter Corporation to control data substitution and set moderation rules. However, this issue can only be resolved through the complete decentralization of the platform. To achieve this, blockchain technology is crucial as it enables the operation of decentralized applications with smart contracts serving as the foundation for system-user interaction. In this paper, we propose the minimum viable implementation of a similar social network called Brain Logger, which stores all necessary data in the NEAR blockchain network. Introducing a small fee for modifying data on the network ensures a solution to the aforementioned problems. The implementation includes a smart contract for blockchain networks and a web application frontend. The smart contract was developed using the NEAR software development kit in Rust, while the frontend was created in JavaScript using the React framework and Redux for local data storage. The code can be accessed on Github.},

abstract = {The music industry faces numerous challenges regarding tracking and distributing royalties. This article explores how a decentralized and transparent system for managing music royalties can be created with a smart contract implementation on the Polygon network, utilizing Chainlink oracles. By enhancing the efficiency and transparency of royalty distribution, this groundbreaking smart contract has the potential to revolutionize the music industry and stand as a blueprint for diverse sectors grappling with analogous challenges in intellectual property rights and revenue allocation. At its core, this smart contract, functioning on the bedrock of blockchain, ensures meticulous oversight of financial transactions between consumers and content creators. It streamlines the process and facilitates the collection of user view statistics crucial for strategic fund allocation. With the potential impact of transaction fees on the user experience of blockchain payments, a new solution has been developed that includes a payment channel that reserves significant amounts of funds and enables off-chain payments through specialized messages. By combining these technological advancements, we are taking a transformative step towards a more seamless and fair future in the complex world of royalty management. The application is structured into conventional backend and frontend segments, with the code available on Github.},

abstract = {The metaverse, as a rapidly evolving socio-technical phenomenon, exhibits significant potential across diverse domains by leveraging Web3 (a.k.a. Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

abstract = {Web services that use a blockchain and crypto-assets (Web3 services) improve user privacy by anonymous logins using wallet addresses. However, since many users list their account identities (IDs) on social networking service (SNS) profile pages and reuse their account IDs for self-branding and curation purposes, which increases the risk of de-anonymization on Web3 services by linking these accounts. If such high-risk SNS accounts hold large amounts of crypto-assets, they are subject to account hijacking and spoofing attacks for financial gain. In this study, we proposed a method to discover highly relevant SNS accounts from a seed account on Web2 and Web3 SNSs and estimate their account ownership. We applied our method to 480 seed accounts of 9 different SNSs and discovered 1,233 new accounts. We found that SNSs with multiple URL input forms on their profile setting pages linked more accounts and revealed that 207 out of 253 (81.8\%) users reused their IDs across different SNSs. We identified 26 accounts linked to personal and crypto-asset information that are at risk of de-anonymization. Our user study using crowdsourcing services showed that as many as 232 (40.8\%) out of 568 respondents do not understand the traceability of blockchain transaction histories. We examined the security and privacy risks caused by account listing and ID reuse, and made recommendations for service providers and users based on our findings.},

abstract = {Recently, the concept of metaverse has been rapidly emerging, which highly expands the human living space. Specifically, 3D models are at the heart of building a vast metaverse space, so a massive number of 3D models are needed. Existing 3D model libraries and platforms have achieved great results. However, most of them are unscalable, insufficiently open, inefficient to collect, and at risk of service disruption and data corruption. Therefore, we propose and implement Web3DP, a crowdsourcing platform for 3D models based on Web3 (a.k.a. Web 3.0) infrastructure. By using the decentralized blockchain technology, Web3DP has the advantages of transparency, auditability, traceability, data tamper-proof, high file transfer efficiency, and service stability. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed platform. It illustrates that Web3DP shows better file transmission capabilities with an acceptable transaction fee to facilitate 3D model collecting and managing for metaverse, games, cultural heritage, etc.},

abstract = {Web3 social media strives to eliminate the need for centralized management by building upon on technologies such public ledgers and smart contracts. This has generated significant hype, but creates many notable challenges, many of which remain unaddressed. One such challenge is content moderation. Specifically, the immutable nature of blockchain means that it becomes impossible to retrospectively delete posts. This means that illegal content posts cannot be moderated or removed. In an attempt to overcome this, Web3 platforms, such as memo.cash, allow users to filter out posts from their personal timelines. Taking memo.cash as a use case, the goal of this work is to study the efficacy of the approach, and identify associated challenges. A particularly unique feature of memo.cash is that users must pay money (satoshi) for each social action (e.g., posting and blocking other users). We conjecture that this may impact the nature of moderation, particularly among poorer users. To explore this, we gather data from memo.cash covering 24K&nbsp;users, 317K&nbsp;posts, and 2.57M user actions. We investigate how the need to pay may impact the moderation system and propose potential solutions to address the challenges that arise.},

We delve into the security concerns perceived by users in each of these components and analyze the mitigation strategies they employ, ranging from risk assessment and aversion to diversification and acceptance. We further discuss the landscape of both technical and human-induced security risks in the Web3 ecosystem, identify the unique security differences between Web2 and Web3, and highlight key challenges that render users vulnerable, to provide implications for security design in Web3.},

abstract = {The development of the Internet has revolutionized the news industry. While bringing various advantages, it has also caused an overflow of fake and malicious news, which has damaged social and economic benefits. In recent years, new news detection schemes are constantly proposed. In the scheme based on artificial detection, blockchain has become an important infrastructure and tool. Because blockchain is open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and traceable, it has important use value in the scenario of artificial detection, which requires the consensus of multiple entities. However, most of the current blockchain-based solutions focus on ex-ante detection, and they do not implement fine-grained detection division. Obviously, one validator cannot detect the authenticity of all types of news, which leads to a reduction in the credibility of the detection results. In this paper, we propose a framework for news full lifecycle management. First, the news is matched with the professional validators through a fine-grained detection control strategy. Then, based on sealed bid auction and secret sharing technology, a Six-stage Submission Protocol is proposed, which places the validator's consensus process off-chain, saving transaction costs and ensuring the credibility of the detection results. We analyzed the cost and performance of the proposed framework, and the results proved its correctness and feasibility.},

However, HCI research has so far failed to address them, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is problematic as these new blockchains come with an increasingly diverse set of properties that influence the usability of dApps for end-users. For blockchain interface design guidelines to be valuable for practitioners, they need to acknowledge the heterogeneity of blockchains. However, evaluating novel interface concepts across different blockchains is resource-intensive as each blockchain has to be integrated manually, slowing down research. To address this challenge, we propose a system to support interface experimentation for blockchain applications. The system allows researchers and developers to connect interfaces to a unified API simulating different blockchains and facilitates the configuration, distribution, and evaluation of online experiments. A preliminary evaluation showed promising results.},

Among these, Web3 social media platforms have begun to emerge. These store all social interaction data (e.g., posts) on a public ledger, removing the need for centralized data ownership and management. But this comes at a cost, which some argue is prohibitively expensive. As an exemplar within this growing ecosytem, we explore memo.cash, a microblogging service built on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. We gather data for 24K users, 317K posts, 2.57M user actions, which have facilitated $6.75M worth of transactions. A particularly unique feature is that users must pay BCH tokens for each interaction (e.g., posting, following). We study how this may impact the social makeup of the platform. We therefore study memo.cash as both a social network and a transaction platform.},

This paper proposes a data privacy protection and fingerprint tracing method based on the features of decentralization, traceability and non-tampering in blockchain technology. And we combined with the protection of data by secure network platform in trusted computing and differential-traceability algorithm (DTA). We propose a data privacy protection and fingerprint traceability method, and use the SkipList table index structure to improve interaction efficiency. We discuss the proposed data fingerprint-based traceability framework model in a trusted environment using the features of blockchain and trusted computing platforms. In this paper, the data can be processed safely and efficiently to solve the privacy problem, the transaction data is encrypted and recorded on the chain by DTA, and the interaction process uses the SkipList table index to enhance retrieval efficiency. Finally, through multiple experiments and comparison of the results obtained from security testing, it is verified that the blockchain-trusted computing data privacy protection and data fingerprint traceability SkipList table indexing method can achieve traceability for data privacy protection, transaction security management and peer-to-peer verification of encryption and decryption algorithms. We not only provide a secure, trustworthy and efficient data privacy protection model, but also bring a time efficiency optimization of 6ms per 10,000 queries.},

Therefore, it is important to control and ensure the availability of the company’s service from necessary places on the planet. For checking the availability of the service, the organization can implement the approach of using special internet services, but they do not look reliable. To increase trust between the parties, it is necessary to implement blockchain technology. The paper presents the blockchain-based availability testing service. The service allows organizations not only to verify the accuracy of the work done but also allows checking the availability from the special places.},

abstract = {Financial institutions own balanced portfolios with different types of assets, resulting in a low-risk investment. At the same time, assets cannot be broken down into smaller parts with comparable risk for resale owing to regulators’ restrictions caused by a lack of auditability. Blockchain overcomes this issue with smart contracts. By now, the way to tokenize financial assets into a commodity is known. In this paper, we provide technical details for tokenization. Namely, an artificial dataset from Forex data is constructed for demonstration purposes; two tokenization algorithms are implemented and applied to the dataset; ERC1155-based smart contract is implemented and applied to the algorithms’ output to perform sold-out and secondary market steps. The source code is openly available.},

abstract = {Securing and managing medical data in hospitals is one of the significant challenges still existing in healthcare. There can be different kinds of patients staying in hospitals with various diseases. All these medical data records need to be secured appropriately for future use and verification. In the hospital, there will be essential documents such as criminal cases and postmortem reports, although it is unclear if they are being handled properly or not. Even the hospital staff can alter these data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based secured medical data management system to manage access to each medical record in a network of hospitals. The proposed system has three main access management categories: one for securing general (fever or cold) medical report, category 2 for postmortem or crime reports security and category 3 for securing cancer /brain death /genetic disorder reports. Sensitive clinical data should not be visible to patients with cancer or genetic disorders as these patients have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Hence, the data is accessible only to doctors, family members, and researchers. The data related to the crime or postmortem reports have only limited access for those with legal permission to access and verify these types of reports. So through blockchain distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, we could store the data in a tamper-proof manner and manage the user access to these data.},

In the blockchain-backed Web3 communities, known for their transparency and security, airdrop serves as a widespread incentive mechanism for allocating capital and power. However, it remains a controversy on how to justify airdrop to incentive and empower the decentralized governance. In this paper, we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role taxonomy methodology through a data-driven study to understand the characteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop. We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters. In conjunction with the results, we discuss from the aspects of interaction, financialization, and system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions for decentralized communities.},

abstract = {Vehicle based logistics are hinged on their ability to timely deliver goods, services, and people. The classical expression of “time is money” comes alive in the logistics industry yielding potentially huge financial and health consequences in case of missing deadlines. This is especially the case for time sensitive pharmaceuticals, delivery of perishable goods, delivery of people travelling, delivery of services in fault fixing/recovery sector. All these use cases motivate the need for an immutable, secure, and immortalized process of tracking time. To solve this challenge, this paper presents prototype-based research that integrates the 4th industrial revolution technologies of vision Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and blockchain. The developed prototype features a Raspberry-PI board embedding a camera, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to recognize plate letters from the image and a crypto wallet to sign the logging of plate number and time events on the NEAR blockchain, an emerging sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain that is simple to use, secure and scalable. The effective operation of the developed prototype has been validated inside a campus parking and shows an accuracy of 80\%. The benefits of transparency, security, and immutability of the blockchain combined with the intelligence, data capture, and processing of IoT will enable to develop accountability solutions trusted by all different logistic stakeholders.},

To prevent malicious transactions from getting into blockchains in advance, we propose a runtime hook technique to synchronize and analyze the ongoing transactions exposed to the Ethereum transaction pool. Having a complete view of the past and the ongoing transactions, we can identify and enforce abortion of malicious transactions and prevent losses due to attacks being executed and recorded in the blockchain. Specifically, we modify the Ethereum source code to instrument the entry point of a node to synchronize data received from the Ethereum P2P network and systematically scan suspicious patterns in transactions to identify potential attacks. As a proof-of-the-concept, we show how to deploy the proposed runtime hook system on a private blockchain system, such that we can detect and prevent transactions of double spending on the 51\% attack and reentrancy attack of smart contracts.},

This paper investigates a proof-of-concept (PoC) of the integration of blockchain in the land registration system to improve the reliability of storage and reduces the steps in the process. The process of loan contracts with banks is used in the PoC and an Ethereum-based private blockchain is developed and tested. Performance evaluation of our proposed system can handle at least 26 transactions per second over a range of a number of transactions of interest. The results show promising potential both in the reduction of process and the performance of blockchain for the proposed use case.},

abstract = {Security and privacy are primary concerns in IoT management. Security breaches in IoT resources, such as smart sensors, can leak sensitive data and compromise the privacy of individuals. Effective IoT management requires a comprehensive approach to prioritize access security and data privacy protection. Digital twins create virtual representations of IoT resources. Blockchain adds decentralization, transparency, and reliability to IoT systems. This research integrates digital twins and blockchain to manage access to IoT data streaming. Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration. The research presented in this paper enables multitenant access and customization of data streaming views and abstracts the complexity of data access management. This approach provides access and configuration security and data privacy protection.},

abstract = {By rendering game scenes on the remote cloud and delivering real-time video to end devices via the Internet, cloud gaming enables players to access game services anytime anywhere despite the hardware capacity of their terminals. However, as a commercial service, the state-of-the-art payment models for cloud gaming are still in their preliminary stages. In this paper, we reveal the shortages of existing cloud gaming pricing models and propose CloudArcade, a token-based cloud gaming system that employs blockchain-empowered cryptocurrency as a payment method for the players using the cloud gaming services. By using cryptocurrency, CloudArcade provides a transparent and resource-aware pricing method, it also enables a time irrelevant silent payment on the floating price to protects users' payment. These features eliminate the quality of experience degradation caused by the spot price in the traditional dynamic pricing model on the QoE-aware service pricing. We also employ the payment channel in CloudArcade to improve the system performance. Discussions on service pricing criteria are put forward, open issues about token issuing and malicious resource speculation are also reviewed. We believe the design of CloudArcade can show a good generality on other QoE-aware and human-centered applications.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on addressing the prevalent issues related to established Verifiable Random Function (VRF) schemes and presents our novel VRF scheme. Our proposed distributed VRF scheme employs multi-party computation (MPC) where each participant is identified by their own decentralized identifiers (DID) on a blockchain network, making the collective randomness by preventing any single participant from determining the output of the VRF. We further aim to enhance the randomness of our VRF scheme by utilizing a successor rule-based de Bruijn sequence to generate pseudo-random numbers with a strong balanced property, ensuring both numbers of 1s and 0s are equal. For generic VRF construction, we adapt the approach of selective-secure VRF scheme using verifiable functional encryption (VFE), which is a more generalized version of homomorphic encryption plus verifiability. Moreover, we estimate the security aspects of our VRF scheme and the entropy approximation based on the information-theoretic perfect secrecy model. Also, using the NIST SP800-22 test suite for randomness, we demonstrate the randomness performance with a 98.29\% overall pass rate on the total 176 tests of 11 standard tests and 0.6765 of the average p -value for statistical randomness. We provide technical details on implementing our VRF MPC model in the Solidity smart contract.},

Until now, scientific efforts have been primarily focused on theoretical discussions about the implications of the technology and on technical proposals to improve and consolidate the underlying infrastructure, neglecting the experience of people using blockchain-based systems. However, for this technology to permeate the mainstream, blockchain technology should be easily accessible to the general public. This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps. Also, we saw how blockchain metaphors and transaction-mediated interactions challenge established mental models for modern applications, imposing heavy workloads on users. We conclude the paper by discussing design implications resulting from blockchain’s paradigm change.},

The Wetcoin.eth project endeavours to prompt such reflection on an issue critical to our survival as a species - water management - and does so through an artistic-scientific model which is hydrocentric and capable of self-management in both virtual and real economies.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals’ quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner’s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.},

abstract = {The penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the energy market has become a immersive paradigm for facilitating greener environment by mitigating the disadvantages of the fossil-fuel vehicles. Nevertheless, it becomes critical for charging station (CS) to handle huge number of EVs further leading to the uncoordinated and inefficient charging. Moreover, none of the authors have considered the possible EV charging scenarios for allocation at the CS. Thus, we have designed an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application for EV charging at the CS along with the energy trading between prosumer and consumer EVs. Further, we have formulated charging scenarios based on the energy demand and type of EV (emergency and high authority). We have deployed the smart contract in Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and further built a decentralized application using Web3 to made charging allocation accessible to the EVs. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed smart contract for the application is evaluated in terms of gas consumption and cost analysis with the help of deployed smart contract in the Remix IDE.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in the healthcare industry is the information sharing and patient's privacy. The implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) [30] in 1996 made difficult for software vendors to manage the documents and records of the patients. Blockchain based technology, which uses cryptography to facilitate exchange and transaction of values and goods over a network, has been proposed to resolve this issue. The decentralized ledge of blockchain would provide immutability, confidentiality, accountability and transparency for information sharing between healthcare stakeholders. In this paper, we implemented the Ethereum Smart Contract, an extended part of the blockchain in healthcare industry with objectives of keeping all the records and transactions safe and secure, and at the same time, reducing the number of user data breaches. We carried out a number of experiments in order to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.},

abstract = {The publish and subscribe messaging model has proven itself as a dominant messaging paradigm for IoT systems. An example of such is the commonly used Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, the security concerns with this protocol have presented vital security challenges in most IoT applications. For example, the MQTT protocol does not have secure authentication mechanisms implemented and leaves that task to the developer as all the included native security services are fragile. This paper will present a well-thought approach involving a lightweight authentication and authorization scheme together with a decentralized identity system to manage the users' identities. This mechanism helps in facilitating the authentication for both subscribers and publishers by utilizing a smart contract in Ethereum blockchain to guarantee trust, accountability and preserve user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to prove our work, which involves a decentralized MQTT platform and dashboard using our approach. The usability of this approach was further analyzed, particularly concerning CPU and memory utilization. Our analysis proved that our approach satisfies IoT applications' requirements since it reduces the consumption of resources and that smart contracts help in the automation of data management processes.},

Therefore, the applications that rely on them will eventually need to migrate from one blockchain instance to another to remain competitive and secure, as well as to enhance the business process, performance, cost efficiency, privacy, and regulatory compliance. However, the differences in data and smart contract representations, modes of hosting, transaction fees, as well as the need to preserve consistency, immutability, and data provenance introduce unique challenges over database migration. We first present a set of blockchain migration scenarios and data fidelity levels using an illustrative example. We then present a set of migration patterns to address those scenarios and the above data management challenges. Finally, we demonstrate how the effort, cost, and risk of migration could be minimized by choosing a suitable set of data migration patterns, data fidelity level, and proactive system design. Practical considerations and research challenges are also highlighted.},

In this work, we propose the first IoT hardware architecture model designed to accelerate time-consuming operations of IoT-Blockchain.

Stakeholders can donate to any scheme they are concerned in and make money if initiative is positive or successful. Belief is a key component for everyone involved in generating funds, including the donor, the company that provides the fundraising platform's services, and even the fundraiser. However, traditional crowdfunding platforms have some limitations, such as high transaction fees, payment processing delays, and lack of transparency. So, this paper has emerged blockchain technology to address these limitations, offering a new model of crowdfunding that is decentralized, secure, and transparent. The proposed solution is a blockchain-based crowdfunding service platform in the form of a Decentralized Application (DApp), which further utilizes smart contracts and crowdfunding campaigns to execute the crowdfunding process. The proposed solution is time-saving, and cost-efficient and reduces the risk of the donations being used for malicious purposes.},

Blockchain will be able to keep track of all noisy responses generated with differential privacy algorithm and allow for certain queries to reuse old responses. In this paper, a demo of a proposed blockchain-based privacy management system is designed as an interactive decentralised web application (DApp).

This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

abstract = {Numerous supply-chain combines with internet of things (IoT) applications have been proposed, and many methods and algorithms enhance the convenience of supply chains. However, new businesses still find it challenging to enter a supply chain, because unauthorised IoT devices of different companies illegally access resources. As security is paramount in a supply chain, IoT management has become very difficult. Public resources allocation and waste management also pose a problem. To solve the above problems, we proposed a new IoT management framework that embraces blockchain technology to help companies to form a supply chain effectively. This framework consists of an access control system, a backup peer mechanism and an internal data isolation and transmission approach. The access control system has a registrar module and an inspection module. The registrar module is mainly responsible for information registration with a registration policy, which has to be followed by all the companies in the supply chain. Besides, it provides a revocation and updating function. The inspection module focuses on judging misbehaviour and monitors the actions of the subjects; when any misoperation occurs, the system will correspondingly penalise violators. So that all related actions and information are verified and stored into blockchain, the IoT access control and safety of IoT admission are enhanced. Furthermore, in a blockchain system, if one single peer in the network breaks down, then the whole system may stop, because consensus cannot be reached. The data of the broken peer may be lost if it does not commit yet. The backup peer mechanism allows the primary peer and the backup peer to connect to an inspecting server for acquiring real-time data. The internal data isolation and transmission modules transmit and stores private data without creating a new subchannel. The proposed method is taken full account of the stability of the network and the fault tolerance to guarantee the robust of the system. To obtain unbiases results, experiments are conducted in two different blockchain environment. The results show our proposed method are promising IoT blockchain system for the supply chain.},

This project aims to solve these problems by applying Ethereum smart contracts to the crowdfunding site to that the contracts will be fully automatically executed, thus preventing frauds and ensuring that the projects can be delivered within duration given.},

abstract = {Blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApp) have been widely adopted in different areas and trusted by more and more users due to the fact that the back end code of a DApp is publicly run on the blockchain and cannot be modified implicitly. However, there are few effective methods and tools for testing DApps and bugs can be easily introduced by inexperienced developers. The existing testing techniques either focus on testing front-end programs or back-end code but ignore the interaction between them, which makes it difficult to apply the techniques directly on DApp. In this paper, we present an automated testing technique for DApps which works in a two-phase manner. First, we employ random events to infer an abstract relation between browser-side events and blockchain-side contracts. Second, our technique generates a set of test cases under the guidance of inferred relations and orders the test cases based on a read-write graph. We also use taint analysis to track data flow of the smart contract and feed it to the generation procedure for following test cases. We have developed a tool called Sungari to implement our approach, and evaluated it on representative real-world DApps. The preliminary evaluation results demonstrated the potential of Sungari in achieving a significant optimization compared to random testing approaches.},
