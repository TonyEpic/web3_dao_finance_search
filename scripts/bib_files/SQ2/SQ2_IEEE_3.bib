  abstract={The new generation of Power Management Controller (PMC) for Microcontroller Units (MCU) in the automotive application field is targeting increased modularity and flexibility of use, aiming to simplify board design and reduce external components as well as to reduce both development time and high volume production cost. A structural PMC design approach is followed by breaking the Intellectual Property (IP) system into several fundamental building blocks. Each block has a well defined set of features to cover the most demanding applications but allowing for scalability and flexible use, and speed up overall system design. In this paper we present a scalable architecture for a 5V PMC in CMOS 55nm technology. It includes a novel bandgap voltage reference with high noise immunity and improved curvature trimming based on bipolar ratio, a set of Low Voltage Detectors (LVDs) working sequentially during rising/falling supply edges, High Voltage Detectors (HVD), and an auxiliary back-up 1.2V regulator able to support fast load transitions, while the main 1.2V regulator is dedicated to supply most of the power consumption. The PMC IP has been integrated in automotive MCUs, with area from 0.6 to 1.2mm2, and Si results indicate modular architecture provides excellent trade-off among system complexity, power, wide safety specification features, low risk, and time to market.},

  pages={454-457},
  abstract={A polymer TIR-based chip has been developed. The chip is monolithically fabricated using Si bulk micromachining and PDMS casting at very low cost. A PDMS microchannel is attached to the chip by van-der-Waals contact through a common thin glass slide to form an integrated microfluidic (TIR)-based chip. The slide-format of the microfluidic TIR-based chip can be employed with both inverted and upright fluorescent microscope. This paper reports the first application of this microfluidic TIR-based chip to study microfluidic flow by nano-PIV with an upright fluorescent microscope. Pressure-driven flows of carboxylate-modified Nile-red nanotracers are generated inside the microchannel of the microfluidic TIR-based chip. The time-sequenced fluorescent images of tracers, illuminated by evanescent field, are recorded onto a CCD camera and are cross-correlated by a PIV program to obtain the near-wall velocity field at various shear rates. Our integrated system could be an important component of a micro-total analysis system (mu-TAS) to study nanoparticles or bio-molecules transport and their near-wall interactions in a microchannel.},

  abstract={This paper presents for the first time a micro-size MEMS mirror design that achieves large rotational mechanical angles of two axes using single electromagnetic field. The mirror features special packaging method that corrects the coupling effect between the axes, resulting in highly stable mechanical angle response. Additionally, the mirror includes honeycomb structures on the backside that distribute weight uniformly, improving stability. At resonant mode, The MEMS mirror reaches rotational mechanical angles of 10 degrees in the fast axis and 20 degrees in the slow axis with the current of mA order, which allows this mirror working for close-range scanning applications, such as dental ablation.

  abstract={In this work, high temperature plasma nitridation process was developed on TEL SPA tool. Thin thermal SiO2 film was then surface treated by the nitridation process, and experiments were designed to evaluate its potential application in advanced CMOS technology. SIMS and XPS characterization were performed to analyze Si-N bond concentration and depth profile in thin thermal SiO2 film. It is found that the Si-N bond ratio will increase and peak of Si-N bond concentration will be pushed from surface to the Si-SiO2 interface as the process time increases. Based on the experimental results, Si-N ratio of the optimized process can reach ~13.5% with the peak at bout ~0.474 Å, which can well match advanced CMOS technology requirements.},

  number={},
  pages={39-43},
  abstract={A low-profile dual-band antenna with polarization/pattern diversity is proposed for 2.4/5-GHz wireless local area network (WLAN) applications. The lower-band element is composed of four shorted patches, which are excited in-phase and equal magnitude to generate omnidirectional radiation pattern with vertical polarization. The higher-band element is a differential-fed circular patch encompassed by eight mushroom-type structures to generate a wideband broadside dual-polarized radiation. The internal corners of the lower-band patches are truncated to embed the higher-band element without any overlap, and consequently, achieve a compact size. The final design with overall size of 0.57λ2.4-GHz× 0.57λ2.4-GHz × 0.03λ2.4-GHz yields a 10-dB return-loss bandwidth of 70/1050 MHz and realized gain of 0.39/9.9 dBi at 2.4/5-GHz WLAN bands, respectively. Also, the antenna achieves an isolation of ≥30 dB through both lower- and upper-bands.},

  abstract={This paper develops a programmable metasurface for holographic imaging application in millimeter-wave regime. The 1-bit metasurface unit cell integrated with two PIN diodes has been designed. By simultaneously switching two PIN diodes from ON state to OFF state, the reflection phase difference is approximately 180° with the reflection magnitude better than -2 dB. Based on Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm and Raleigh-Sommerfeld optical diffraction theory, 1-bit metasurface unit cells are arranged into a metasurface array. Numerical results are given to demonstrate that the proposed metasurface array achieves good holographic imaging of different letters by dynamically changing the phase encodings on the array, providing a promising solution for high-resolution and high-fidelity image reconstruction.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={In practice, the energy consumption of industrial equipment rises mostly due to wear and tear, which might include leaks or faulty plant conditions. By using statistical techniques and artificial intelligence, energy managers can promptly identify abnormal energy usage and determine the underlying causes for such anomalies. There are various machine learning algorithms powerful enough to become anomaly detectors; however, relevant candidates must be sufficiently accurate and rapid response for industrial application. Thanks to suitable performance on different types of unsupervised anomaly detection, the Local Outlier Factor approach has been selected. The aim of this study is to identify abnormal energy consumption patterns for preventing energy loss and promoting predictive maintenance in a beverage processing factory in Vietnam. The anomaly score has been evaluated to detect multivariate and subsequence anomalies. Finally, energy consumption time-series with anomalous points highlighted has been provided for the business user to be actionable on the anomaly.},

  abstract={This paper presents a wirelessly powered, batteryless bipolar biphasic constant current stimulator (CCS) for gastric application. The proposed current stimulator employs a 0X/1X regulating rectifier to realize voltage rectification and regulation in one stage. Thus, an additional dc-dc converter for internal controller voltage generation, which occupies a large volume and reduces receiver efficiency, is eliminated. A positive voltage charge pump and a bipolar biphasic constant-current stimulator are integrated together to demonstrate bipolar biphasic stimulation with a maximum stimulation current of 6 mA and a step of 0.2 mA. The chip was fabricated in a 0.18-μm HV CMOS technology. A measured maximum rectifier PCE is 84.8%, and peak charge pump PCE is 60%.},

The antenna structure incorporates two decoupled, predominantly linearly polarized radiators. Both radiators provide an input matching of better than -8 dB over a frequency range from 4.5GHz to 11GHz. The antenna radiation patterns are characterized by a front-to-back ratio between 4 dB - 7.5 dB and a maximum gain of 5 dBi between 5GHz and 7GHz in main beam direction. The pattern correlation coefficients below 0.3 confirm broadband diversity properties sufficient for MIMO applications. The overall antenna diameter and height are 50mm and 24mm respectively. It could therefore be used as a surface mounted or ceiling antenna in buildings, vehicles or aircrafts for communication systems.},

  volume={3},
  number={},
  pages={872-877 vol.3},
  abstract={MAC layer protocols for wireless ad hoc networks typically assume that the network is homogeneous with respect to the transmit power capability of individual nodes in the network. The IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol has been popular for use in ad hoc networks. We investigate the performance of this protocol when it is used in a network with nodes that transmit at various power levels. We show that overall throughput is lower than the throughput of a network in which all nodes transmit at identical power levels. In addition, low power nodes have a disadvantage in accessing the medium due to higher levels of interference from the high power nodes. We consider propagating the control messages generated by a node wishing to initiate communication to distant nodes so that they may forbear transmissions for some time, thereby allowing clear access to the initiating node. We find that the overhead incurred due to the additional message transmissions outweighs the potential gain achieved by propagating these messages. This indicates that the signalling mechanism used in the IEEE 802.11 standard or the variants thereof are not sufficient to alleviate the loss in throughput and the lack of fairness engendered by networks that are heterogeneous with regard to the transmit power capabilities of individual nodes.},

This proposal introduces software metrics based on a qualitative factorization criterion. Our approach takes into account the notion of a generic feature, which is a set of features that are semantically connected and partially ordered by specialization.

  abstract={In this letter, the structural, electronic, and optical properties of blue phosphorene (BP) and graphene-like aluminum nitride (AlN) nanocomposite are investigated by the first-principles method. Despite the indirect bandgap nature of the BP and AlN monolayers, AlN/BP heterostructure exhibits a direct bandgap characteristic in the most stable pattern. Moreover, we also find that the optically active states of the maximum valence and the minimum conduction bands are localized on opposite monolayers, leading to the electrons and holes spontaneously separated (type-II band alignment), which enhances the photocatalytic efficiency. Most interestingly, the AlN/BP heterobilayer exhibits enhanced optical properties in the visible and UV light zone, which is comparable or even superior to pristine BP - overall, the suitable direct gap and band edges positions, type-II band alignment, and fascinating visible and UV light adsorption, which enable AlN/BP heterostructure to have great potential applications in the field of solar energy conversion and photocatalytic water splitting.},

  abstract={Due to the increasing performance and decreasing price of microcontrollers, applying a high sampling frequency becomes more feasible in modern control. This approach is known as multisampling technology. This paper tries to give an overview of the multisampling application in power electronics converters as it enables a lot of opportunities. First, the multisampling can reduce control delays and thereby break bandwidth limitations in power electronic controllers. Secondly, a smarter control strategy can be realized with more current, voltage and system information acquired through multisampling techniques. However, this approach may also introduce two major drawbacks: risk of dead bands and high-frequency switching ripples, which may degrade the system stability margin. To address these issues, different solutions are explored and illustrated in this paper.},

  abstract={The proliferation of multimedia applications had led to explosively increasing multimedia traffic over wireless networks. To tackle such an explosive traffic load, caching contents at the edge of the network has been envisioned as a practical solution since it eliminates unnecessarily repeated transmission through backhaul links. In this paper, we propose a caching placement scheme to determine the number of cached chunks at the local base station (BS), which are nearest to users. The objective is to minimize the average stalling time of all users in the system concerning strict constraints of storage size of BSs and the delay tolerance defined by requesting users. We formulate the problem and propose a practical solution that outperforms the random caching scheme.},

  abstract={With the development of Information Technology (IT) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Communications Service Providers (CSPs) can collect much information from telecommunication circuits. However, some of the existing circuit measurement has not been used well. For CSPs, it is important to find more efficient ways of utilizing the circuit measurement, e.g., delay, jitter, packet loss, and speed-test results for customer satisfaction. One of the most popular ways is to use speed-test tools (such as Speedtest online) to measure the service rate of the application layer. However, it is difficult to justify whether the telecommunication circuit is normal or not. For example, when the speed-test result of a specific circuit is 90 Mbps, the physical line rate may be 100Mbps. To address the above issues, we first investigate the measurement and management mechanisms of the existing telecommunications networks, including the core components and protocols. In this paper, we leverage artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to predict whether customers complain or not. We evaluate the proposed AI model by using the real data from telecommunication circuits and analyze the key performance metrics.},

  abstract={In general telecommunication, control and signal processing, mathematical models of objects are often built from the physical process. In fact, some objects have complex physical models, therefore, accurate description of the object will results to large and high-order mathematical models. This causes difficulties for the computation and design. Hence, finding a lower-order model that still has the important characteristics of the high-order models with acceptable errors is essential. This paper presents the reduced order model problem and studies on balancing approach proposed by Moore. The comprehensive research includes: transient response h(t), frequency response and applications in control.

  abstract={This paper presents the design of a dual-polarized log.-periodic four arm antenna bent on a conical MID substrate. The bending of a planar structure in free space is highlighted and the resulting effects on the input impedance and radiation characteristic are analyzed. The subsequent design of the UWB compliant prototype is introduced. An adequate agreement between simulated and measured performance can be observed. The antenna provides an input matching of better than -8 dB over a frequency range from 3 GHz to 9 GHz. The antenna pattern is characterized by a radiation with two linear, orthogonal polarizations and a front-to-back ratio of 6 dB. A maximum gain of 5.6 dBi is achieved at 5.5 GHz. The pattern correlation coefficients confirm the suitability of this structure for diversity and MIMO applications. The overall antenna diameter and height are 50 mm and 24 mm respectively. It could therefore be used as a surface mounted or ceiling antenna in buildings, vehicles or aircrafts for communication systems.},

Proposed sensor design with 3mm × 3mm × 300µm dimensions, has the capability to measure not only the magnitude but also the direction of the force applied. A wagon wheel spring structure was proposed, where 8 beams work as springs to relief the force applied. Behavior of these 8 beams are monitored under each loading conditions using defused piezoresistive sensing elements. A finite element analysis of structure was performed to optimize and validate the structure and Multiphysics analysis was performed to validate the working principal of the proposed sensor.},

The sensitivity of the detector is found to be as high as 1.58×104 A/W under the illumination of 365 nm and 8.2×10-8 W/cm2 at 10 V.

  abstract={Patients with impaired hand function have many difficulties in hand rehabilitation treatment. Conventional therapies are expensive, require a lot of practice, and require expert supervision.

In this paper, we propose the Mosquito game as a tool to support upper limb rehabilitation aids to help patients increase exercise motivation and improve outcomes after rehabilitation treatment. The test subjects were regular people, including five students. After they played 15 consecutive games, we collected and aggregated their average score and feedback on the Mosquito game. From the obtained results, we believe that the Mosquito game will bring good results and meaningful effects on rehabilitation treatment for patients. In addition, webcam latency affects the player’s score and perception, so we will make the latency achieve better in the future.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a class-D power amplifier (PA) incorporating a power-efficient resonance detection circuit designed for resonant wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. In the operation of resonant WPT systems, the process tolerance of the L-C resonant components on both sides introduce an imaginary part in the equivalent reflected impedance in the PA, resulting in a degradation of the power transferred to the secondary side. The magnitude of the imaginary part can vary depending on the measurement setup of the WPT system, including the coupling distance, misalignment of the coils, and output loading conditions. Therefore, a resonant detector is proposed to estimate the reactance on the primary side and assist in adjusting the magnitude of the compensation capacitance to ensure the resonance of the L-C tank. Additionally, this proposed detector consumes only 249uW during measurement, making it suitable to be employed in low-power applications.},

The vertical photovoltage across the heterostructure changes significantly according to the exerted strain under light illumination. The change is about hundred-fold that of lateral photovoltage under strain application in the literature. The phenomenon is explained by the alteration in the out-of-plane effective mass, energy level, and repopulation of light and heavy holes under the applied strain.

  abstract={Vehicle guidance system (VGS) is one of important contents of intelligent transportation system (ITS). However, in many developing countries, VGS is backward. To heighten level of VGS of China, the composition of VGS, the functions of subsystems were studied, and critical technologies, such as geographic information system (GIS), global positioning system (GPS), were applied into the systems. In order to reduce storage space of road network, the storage mode is improved by adjacent node relation matrix and adjacent node weight matrix. The classical shortest path algorithm, Dijkstra algorithm, was optimized with dynamic adjacent node relation matrix and dynamic adjacent node weight matrix, which enhance the efficiency of calculation for shortest path, and the specific algorithm is presented. The studied VGS based on GIS, GPS, and other technologies was realized. Preliminary application of the VGS show the system can exactly position vehicle, real-timely display running track of vehicle, effectively calculate shortest path, rightly guide diver driving and so on.},

  pages={877-880},
  abstract={A printed MIMO antenna with extremely wide-band (EWB) for multi-band wireless applications has been proposed and analyzed in this paper. The designed antenna satisfies the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) requirement of less than 2.0 in an extremely wide frequency band ranging from 2.7 GHz to 20 GHz. To enhance the isolation coefficient in MIMO antenna, two parallel strips are added between two radiating elements. Consequently, the mutual coupling coefficient is much below -15 dB for all operating frequency band. In addition, since the bandwidth of this antenna covers frequency bands where several applications and/or services may be simultaneously acting in the considered area, it becomes a very important feature the capability of rejecting the interferences occurring between these systems. In this paper, the introduction of suitable slots as an effective method for sub-band notching has been presented, and, as an example, the WLAN band rejection has been considered in detail. By exploiting the optimization possibilities introduced by the slot structure degrees of freedom, it became possible to obtain the desired band rejection. All the here considered structures have been designed choosing for the substrate the popular FR4, with dielectric constant of 4.4, and thickness 1.6 mm.},

  abstract={This article proposes a novel parallel management mode based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for enterprises by utilizing the artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution (ACP) approach, parallel intelligence theory, and blockchain technologies, to realize the distributed management of an enterprise.

Through the non-fungible token (NFT)-based incentive mechanism, metaverse-based virtual learning and training, as well as DAO-based distributed management and decision-making, the management and control of the actual enterprise as well as its employees can be carried out. By virtue of the virtual–real interactions of three types of employees, as well as the virtual–real feedback of three closed loops in the parallel systems, DAO-based parallel management for enterprises can realize descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence.

  abstract={Vienna rectifier with simple structure, which has gained popularity in recent years for ac to dc power conversion for many industrial applications such as electric vehicle charging systems and uninterrupted power system (UPS) systems, accomplishes the operation of unit power factor. However, the distortion of the input current near the zero-crossing point is a puzzle that will increase the current harmonic content. In this article, the cause of the zero-crossing distortion is analyzed, and an improved space vector pulsewidth modulation modulation strategy is proposed. Moreover, the sliding mode control for the outer voltage loop and the phase compensation multiresonance control for the inner current loop is proposed to improve the dynamic response performance of the dc side and achieve zero-error control of the ac side. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed modulation scheme and control strategy.},

In this paper, we develop a novel retrieval method by using graph contexts, which consists of three steps. Initially, we evaluate the performance of spectral distances for deformable shape representation, which has not been studied in detail before. Then, we create a weighted L2 distance for similarity measurement based on the spectra of Laplace-Beltrami operator. Finally, a new local graph diffusion method is introduced to reduce the mismatch error in feature space and the time cost of diffusion has reduced a lot simultaneously. Our experiment results on SHREC'11 Non-rigid dataset have reached the best reported retrieval performance (MAP: 99.9%).},

To this end, we design the Hanoi framework, which integrates human factors, parallel intelligence based on a combination of artificial systems and the natural world, and the DAO to inspire AI innovations.},

  abstract={With a growing complexity of the intelligent traffic system (ITS), an integrated control of ITS that is capable of considering plentiful heterogeneous intelligent agents is desired. However, existing control methods based on the centralized or the decentralized scheme have not presented their competencies in considering the optimality and the scalability simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose an integrated control method based on the framework of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The proposed method achieves a global consensus on energy consumption efficiency (ECE), meanwhile to optimize the local objectives of all involved intelligent agents, through a consensus and incentive mechanism. Furthermore, an operation algorithm is proposed regarding the issue of structural rigidity in DAO. Specifically, the proposed operation approach identifies critical agents to execute the smart contract in DAO, which ultimately extends the capability of DAO-based control. In addition, a numerical experiment is designed to examine the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results indicate that the controlled agents can achieve a consensus faster on the global objective with improved local objectives by the proposed method, compare to existing decentralized control methods. In general, the proposed method shows a great potential in developing an integrated control system in the ITS.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of intelligence and connectivity technology (ICT) has enhanced the efficiency and safety of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, this also increases the complexity of the transportation systems, especially the social complexity, and poses new challenges for their management. This paper discusses the emergence of social transportation, as part of natural evolutionary adaptation to new traffic conditions and technology, which is a paradigm shift from engineering-centered technical systems to society-centered ecosystems. In social transportation systems, all participants including administrators, individual travelers and other stakeholders play a more proactive role in the operation and management of transportation systems. Therefore, we propose to employ a decen-tralized autonomous organization (DAO) as a model for the social transportation system that allows participants to collaborate and coordinate without relying on a central authority. To meet the challenges brought by this transition, we propose to apply ACP-based parallel system theory to restructure the methodology of transportation management. Finally, we present a case study of personal carbon trading system where economic incentives are used to manage traffic demand, affecting others' travel behaviors, and reduce carbon emissions. In the conclusive remarks, we provide our visions and future directions of social transportation systems.},

The DAO's predefined investment strategy will focus on NFTs with a proven track record of successful growth or high potential for future. Additionally, before making any investments, extensive research investigations will be performed. Another potential feature of the proposed DAO platform is the ability to promote stakeholder participation through pre-defined NFTs, assuring active participation from members of the platform. The proposed DAO has the potential to transform NFT investing by promoting a more democratic and inclusive approach. Small investors who would otherwise be unable to participate in the NFT market might do so through this platform by pooling the financial resources. This proposed system incorporates blockchain technology to increase transparency and security, reduce the risk of fraudulent behavior or bad decision-making.

  abstract={This letter presents novel high power and reliable radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems switches with single-pole single-throw (SPST) and single-pole triple-throw (SP3T) configurations. An in-plane movable structure with a single layer is made using a simple standard silicon-on-insulator process, which greatly reduces the micro-fabrication complexity and cost compared with the previously reported multi-contact switches with out-of-plane movable structures. The SPST switch achieves a uniform current distribution through each contact, thereby increasing the power handling capability of the switch. The SP3T switch is a derivative of the SPST switch with separate individual actuations. The experimental results demonstrate that the fabricated switches have superior RF performances: insertion losses are -0.9 and -1.3 dB at 6 GHz for SPST and SP3T switches, respectively, whereas isolations are better than -29 and -37 dB from dc to 6 GHz for SPST and SP3T switches, respectively. In hot-switching conditions, the SPST switch can handle RF power up to 2 W for 10 million cycles, whereas the SP3T switch is capable of handling an RF power of 1 W for 7 million cycles before failure occurs.},

  pages={864-868},
  abstract={This paper presents a simple adaptive framework for robust separation and extraction of multiple sources of radio-frequency interference (RFI) from raw ultra-wideband (UWB) radar signals in challenging bandwidth management environments. RFI sources poses critical challenges for UWB systems since (i) RFI often occupies a wide range of the radar's operating frequency spectrum; (ii) RFI might have significant power; and (iii) RFI signals are difficult to predict and model due to the non-stationary nature as well as the complexity of various communication devices. Existing techniques for RFI suppression either employ filtering (notching) which introduces other harmful side-effects such as side-lobe distortion and target-amplitude reduction or RFI modeling/estimation/tracking which requires complicated narrow-band modulation models or even direct RFI sniffing. We explore in this paper a joint sparse and low-rank model for the separation and then suppression of RFI signals from UWB radar data via modeling RFI as low-rank components in a joint optimization framework. The proposed framework is completely adaptive with highly time-varying environments, does not require any prior knowledge of the RFI sources (other than the low-rank assumption), and is capable of processing already-contaminated radar directly. Both simulated data and real-world data measured by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) UWB synthetic aperture radar (SAR) confirm that our RFI suppression technique successfully recovers UWB radar signals corrupted by high-powered RFI signals.},

  abstract={This contribution presents optically transparent microstrip patch antennas which are designed using meshed conductors. The influences on antenna performance of meshing both patch and ground plane are studied. Important geometrical parameters which have the main impact on the operating frequency and bandwidth are pointed out. The investigation shows that a necessity of reducing the patch size and/or enhancing the bandwidth can be accomplished by the meshing method. Furthermore, antenna structures with an optical transparency of roughly 90% can have comparable properties as a conventional patch antenna. A prototype is fabricated and the simulated and measured results are discussed.},

  abstract={On the basis of analysing the error of robot that results from walking in plane, a new PID controller with BP neural networks is proposed in the paper. The BP Neural Network algorithm is used in PID control because it could adjust parameters itself in real time. By using the BP Neural Network PID controller, the robot can go straight accurately. Simulation results demonstrate that the new PID controller with BP Neural Networks can not only overcome uncertainties and external disturbances, but also get rather good requirement of tracking precision, thus possess better robustness and control performance.},

  abstract={In the world we are living now, it's very difficult to find a people who access to Internet regularly but own no social network account. Social networks play a significant and day by day, more important role. People use Facebook or Twitter for communicating, news reading, information sharing, and advertising. However, these social networks lead to some issues. One of which is the need for a defense mechanism against fake accounts. To separate fake accounts from authentic ones is obviously a non trivial task. In this paper, we propose an empirical ranking scheme, comprising of both graph-based and feature-based approaches to aid the detection of fake Facebook profiles. Utilizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) [4] and Sybil- Walk [8], the model achieved high accuracy over the set of ten thousands Vietnamese Facebook accounts.},

It recurs to the strong, complex, and nonlinear system identification ability of the neural networks that identifies the model and as well as the system's inverse plant model The model of the plant is identified by NNM and its inverse model by NNC. The NNC is trained online in a parallel self-learning system. The whole controller is made up of the inverse controller NNC and a robust controller RC in order to improve the robustness of the control system. Simulation results show that this strategy has strong robustness and self-adaptive ability, and adapts to the parameters changing in the plant and puts on a good control performance as compared with the general PID controller.},

The proposed EBG structure exhibit a tremendous size reduction of 61%.

  abstract={Software-defined radios have introduced new platforms for dynamically modifying wireless system designs, and heterogeneous computing has opened up implementing such designs on different computing elements. Our goal is to develop a hardware-software modeling environment that captures reusability of various processing blocks at the physical layer for several modern protocols, and makes decisions regarding whether each processing block should be part of reconfigurable hardware or embedded processor software based on timing constraints and power budgets for the overlying applications. Our approach creates several different MathWorks Simulink model variants for both the transmitter and the receiver, each with a different boundary between hardware and software components. Using the 802.11a standard as an example, we use these models to generate a bitstream for the FPGA and executable code for the ARM processor on a Xilinx Zynq system-on-chip. Our results collect such metrics as data path delay, resource utilization, and power usage and demonstrate how to enhance the SDR design.},

With the considerations of economy, we integrate the sensory systems and the balancing control systems by utilizing an embedded system based on the SUNPLUSTM SPCE061A EMU board and a CPLD, Altera EPM7128SLC84. There are three points for our design. First, since the system is unstable in nature, it can be used as a teaching aid in the control-related courses to demonstrate the design of various control schemes with fuzzy controller. Second, motion with the self-balancing capability is novel and interesting and has potential to be a toy. In addition, this trial can provide a prototype to verify the techniques and allow the possibility for carry one person development of a commercial two-wheel vehicle in the future.},

The operating mechanism was attributed to the charge storage of fullerene. The memristor exhibited highly reliable with the stable retention time characteristics with a large on/off current ratio of five orders of magnitude at 0.5 V. These obtained results suggest that the memristor based on fullerene can be utilized for storing information in bendable electronics.},

  pages={198-202},
  abstract={This paper describes a laboratory study on ceramsite manufacture using electroplating sludge mixed with pulvized fly ash (PFA) and activated sludge. The extraction toxicity of electroplating sludge and the mixing scale of sintering materials were studied. An orthogonal test was conducted to select the best manufacturing conditions such as warm-up temperature, warm-up time, sintering temperature and sintering time. The test results reveal that the sintering temperature and sintering time are the two major effecting factors during the ceramsite preparation. The strongest ceramsite could be obtained at an optimal condition: the ratio of raw material scale at fly ash: electroplating sludge: activated sludge= 5:10:5, warm-up temperature at 700°C, warm-up time at 15 minutes, sintering temperature at 1200°C, and sintering time at 30 minutes. The quality of the ceramsite produced at optimal condition complies with the referenced Chinese Standard (GB/T17431-1998). Accordingly, it can be concluded that the ceramsite made from electroplating sludge with fly ash and activated sludge is feasible and practicable. Comparing with traditional fly ash ceramsite methods, this method is considered to be more economic and effective in electroplating sludge safe disposal and fly ash ceramsites manufacturing.},

  abstract={The Feature Selective Validation (FSV) algorithm has been used to quantitatively compare and validate two sets of data which are gotten by experiments and simulation respectively in recent 10 years. Patch antenna are used extensively in wireless telecommunication systems. Empirical and semi-empirical techniques have found favor in both research and industrial communities owing to their limited reliance on detailed knowledge of the antenna design. However, those techniques are established on extensive studies and observations in various practical antenna designs. So there is the requirement to provide a reliable means of testing a microstrip antenna design model for a specified pattern to minimize errors in the practical design. In this paper, the FSV technique is extended to the comparison and validation of microstrip antenna model for practical design. First, data sets for typical patch antennas are generated by the empirical antenna model. Second, CAD model and EM simulation model are constructed based on data sets by modeling software. Third, simulation data of S-parameters of antenna are investigated by electromagnetic computation algorithms, such as Finite Integration Technique (FIT). Last, data generated from EM simulation model and typical empirical model are compared and validated by FSV, which showed the effectiveness of the microstrip design under investigating.},

This proposed method could be applied to cosine-BOC(n, n) modulated signals, which are adopted to Galileo signals.

  abstract={In this paper, a novel dual-band Wi-Fi energy harvester based on a human-ring-shaped multi-band antenna and a dual-band rectifier for indoor autonomous IoT devices is presented. The dual-band and compact rectenna harvests energy from a Wi-Fi source with the measured efficiency of 30% at 2.45 GHz (input power of −4.6 dBm) and 7% at 5.5 GHz (input power of −6.8 dBm), respectively. The multi-band antenna has a quasi-omnidirectional radiation pattern to receive energy from multi-direction for the real application.

  abstract={Robot navigation has several security and defence applications. The major technical challenges include measuring the distance between a robot and its surrounding obstacles and modelling the sensing environment. Existing methods using stereo cameras, laser sensors, and low-cost MS Kinect cameras have been suggested for the problems. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy-based approach for approximating the missing depth values in RGB-D images collected from a MS Kinect camera. By investigating different noise models, the missing information, and the relations between the depth and colour images, the proposed approach produces an accurate approximation for missing depth values, which enhances results of subsequent steps in RGB-D image processing.},

  abstract={We present results on the synthesis of core-shell CdSe/ZnS semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (NQDs) and their optical enhancement properties. A very strong and narrow photoluminescence is observed for sizes varying from 2 to 5 nm. Using an effective mass theory, we model the energy shift for the first excited state for core and core/shell NQDs. Core/shell heterostructure can be used to significantly increase the absorption cross section and decrease the efficiency of Auger recombination. Opal structures prepared from silica beads are also reported. This photonic crystal infiltrated with NQDs shows promise in biological detection.},

  abstract={Lithium-ion battery(LiB) is being used in various fields due to their advantages such as high energy density, high power density, and longer cycle life. In order to optimize the performance of the LiB and improve the lifetime of the Electric Vehicle (EV), monitoring the State of Charge (SOC) is very important. Therefore, it is essential to estimate of the SOC of the battery. This paper proposed the SOC estimation model for lithium-ion batteries based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. In the proposed model, SOC estimation of lithium-ion batteries was performed through five steps include variable selection, data collection, data preprocessing, neural network paradigm, and neural network learning. The actual SOC and the predicted SOC of the EV battery model were compared to prove the validity of the ANN model. As a result, the ANN showed the maximum and average errors of 18% and 2.65%, respectively, and the accuracy was 97.35%.},

  abstract={Cyclic codes, which are an important class of error-correcting codes, have wide applications in communication systems and data storage systems. This paper defines a new type of locator polynomial, called radical-locator polynomials, for the algebraic decoding of cyclic codes. These polynomials can be obtained by expanding the determinant of a newly proposed partial syndrome matrix. The sparse representation for the resulting polynomials is theoretically demonstrated. A complete decoding algorithm for cyclic codes is also provided.},

This paper presents yet higher RX sensitivities for the proposed device even with a direct connection to an oscilloscope. We elucidate the effect of DC bias on the acoustic transmit (TX) and receive (RX) characteristics of PZT pMUTs, and how these could be tuned to increase the performance of the pMUTs. The device was fabricated at wafer-scale in our 8-inch line, which is capable of physical vapor deposition (PVD) of high quality PZT.},

  abstract={Crooked line Seismic survey has been widely applied in petroleum and coal prospecting in complex surface. It has obvious advantages in improvement of data quality with freely selection the optimal shooting and receiving locations. Especially in Loess area, data quality can be significantly improved with flexible path of crooked line where sources and receivers are laid in the deep valley to avoid thick loose loess layer; Crooked line can be used to keep away from large obstacles such as villages and cliffs. On the other hand, the scattering of midpoints with crooked line would be a challenge to the stackability of CMP gather and would threat fidelity of profiles. So the space, time and scattering conditions of CMP stackability should be taken as priority in data acquisition and processing of crooked line, so as to ensure the credibility of profile as well as take full advantages of crooked line in some tough areas.},

In view of engineering practice, a class of robust model predictive control algorithm based on the LMI is presented, where constraints on control input are taken into account to prevent large input stretching the strip and doing harm to hot strip mills. Further more H∞ theory is used to reject the disturbance mainly from looper tension system. Therefore, the looper height systemcontrol precision is improved.
