 abstract = {With the increased success of the Internet of Things (IoT), the cloud-based solutions are no longer sufficient to meet the stringent requirements of IoT applications. Besides requiring fast response time, increased security and privacy, they lack computational resources at the edge of the network. Such computational resources distributed closer to the edge represent the fundamental infrastructure of edge and fog paradigms. However, without advanced resource management techniques, the advantages of the paradigms are lost. In this paper, we present a novel distributed resource allocation algorithm with the purpose of enabling seamless integration and deployment of different applications in an IoT infrastructure. The algorithm decides: the (i) mapping of IoT application at the edge of the network, (ii) dynamic migration of parts of the application, such that Service Level Agreement (SLA) is satisfied. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss our approach and the potential to minimize the latency of different IoT applications.},

 abstract = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are introduced to improve individuals’ quality of life by offering a wide range of services. They collect a huge amount of data and exchange them with each other and the infrastructure. The collected data usually includes sensitive information about the users and the surrounding environment. Therefore, data security and privacy are among the main challenges in this industry. Blockchain, an emerging distributed ledger, has been considered by the research community as a potential solution for enhancing data security, integrity, and transparency in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, despite the emphasis of governments on the transparency of personal data protection practices, CAV stakeholders have not been successful in communicating appropriate information with the end users regarding the procedure of collecting, storing, and processing their personal data, as well as the data ownership. This article provides a vision of the opportunities and challenges of adopting blockchain in ITS from the “data transparency” and “privacy” perspective. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1)&nbsp;Considering the amount of personal data collected by the CAVs, such as location, how would the integration of blockchain technology affect transparency, fairness, and lawfulness of personal data processing concerning the data subjects (as this is one of the main principles in the existing data protection regulations)? (2)&nbsp;How can the trade-off between transparency and privacy be addressed in blockchain-based ITS use cases?},

 abstract = {As an integral part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with automated market maker (AMM) protocols have gained massive traction with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

@article{10559626,
 abstract = {Under the social manufacturing context, geographically distributed and decentralized micro-and-small-scale manufacturing enterprises (MSMEs) self-organize into manufacturing communities (MCs), a type of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In MCs, MSMEs share their manufacturing resources for order-driven cross-enterprise production cooperation, which is supported through blockchain-based order tracking. However, the application of blockchain also brings concerns about data security and privacy protection to MSMEs, which leads to disputes between MSMEs about which data should be stored in the blockchain. For this problem, a granular-computing-based data-sharing decision-making (GrC-DSDM) method is proposed. In the GrC-DSDM method, a fuzzy proximity relationship is used to describe the familiarity between MSMEs in the same MC, and MC familiarity is obtained based on the granular space derived from the fuzzy proximity relation. A fuzzy preference relation is used to representMSMEs’ preferences for all metadata related to the order, and a group decision-making method is applied to calculate the preference values for all metadata. Through constructing the mapping relationship between MC familiarity and preference values of all metadata, we can determine which metadata should be shared with the MC for blockchain-based order tracking. The GrC-DSDMmethod can support group decision-making on data sharing among MSMEs in the same MC. The implementation of the GrC-DSDM method is demonstrated through the example of a sheet metal parts processing MC. It is expected that the GrC-DSDMmethod will provide a basis for enabling blockchain-based order tracking inMCs.},

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

 abstract = {Autonomous connected vehicles are revolutionizing the automotive industry vision and impacting their business model. This trend will likely impact other related industries and their business model such as automotive insurance companies, tier-II automotive manufactures, and automotive maintenance service companies. The growing number of connected vehicles will require new policy formulation by the government about privacy and security issues in the era of massive digitalization and automation. Organizations such as 3GPP and IEEE are evolving standards that address security issues for connected vehicles. However, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will play a significant role in 5G networks and beyond, we address the privacy and security issues with a blockchain-based intelligent digital forensics system for autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) in a connected smart world incorporating artificial intelligence. The proposed system includes a novel algorithm for the autonomous connected vehicles and the users' security and privacy. We utilize short randomizable signatures to anonymously authenticate witness's identities and to protect the witnesses' privacy. Then, we leverage fine-grained access control based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for evidence access and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system by simulating the proposed model, its computational costs and communication overhead by implementing a prototype on a local Ethereum blockchain network platform. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed system. We envision the application of the proposed system to ensure security and privacy of ACVs and their security applications for use with 5G-V2X and future XG-V2X networks.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are mass-produced and designed for different applications, ranging from monitoring of the environment to on-demand electrical switches, and so on. These IoT devices are often heterogeneous in nature, only to receive updates at infrequent intervals, and can remain ‘out of sight’ on a home or office network for extended periods. In other words, security and privacy are two key (research and operational) challenges in IoT systems. In recent years, there have been attempts to design deep learning-based solutions to mitigate limitations associated with detection systems designed for typical operational technology (OT) systems, although a number of challenges remain. This paper proposes a federated-based approach that employs a deep autoencoder to detect​ botnet attacks using on-device decentralized traffic data. Through the suggested federated solution, privacy is addressed by ensuring the device’s data is not transferred or moved off the network edge. Instead, the machine learning computation itself is brought to where the data is born (i.e. the edge layer), with the added benefit of data security. We demonstrate that using our proposed model, we can achieve up to 98% accuracy rate in the anomaly detection when using features such as source IP, MAC-IP, and destination IP, etc., for training. The overall comparative performance analysis between our decentralized proposed approach and a centralized format demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy rate of attack detection.},
