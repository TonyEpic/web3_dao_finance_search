 abstract = {As blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApp) become increasingly popular recently, there is an urgent demand for effective testing schemes and tools. Due to the complexity introduced by application-blockchain interaction, existing testing methods become non-applicable. In this paper, we present a guided and automated framework called Sungari to test DApps. The insights behind Sungari are two-fold. First, we employ random events to infer an abstract relation between frontend and blockchain. Second, we use the relation to generate event sequnces in a guided manner that can cover blockchain smart contracts as quick as possible. In a real-world DApp case study, Sungari outperformed random approach by covering 33\% more application use cases.},

 abstract = {A blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) refers to an application typically using web pages or mobile applications as the front-end and smart contracts as the back-end. The front-end of the DApp helps users generate transactions and send them to the user's blockchain wallet. After the user signs and confirms the transaction using the blockchain wallet, the transaction will invoke the smart contract of the DApp. However, users bear the following risks when using DApps because of the potential inconsistent behaviors in DApps. First, the DApp front-end may generate incorrect transactions inconsistent with users' intentions. Second, the smart contract may have misbehaviors when executing the transactions. Inconsistent behaviors of DApps not only lead to user confusion but also cause significant financial losses. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to identify inconsistent behaviors of DApps on EVM-compatible blockchains by contrasting the behaviors of DApps that derived from the front-end, blockchain wallet, and smart contracts, respectively. We implemented our approach into a prototype named DAppHunter. We have applied DAppHunter on 92 real-world DApps of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain and successfully identified 37 DApps with inconsistent behaviors. We confirmed that 35 of them are scam DApps and over 5 million blockchain addresses are at risk of becoming victims of these inconsistent DApps.},

 abstract = {With the widespread popularity of the Internet of Things and various intelligent medical devices, the amount of medical data is rising sharply, and thus medical data processing has become increasingly challenging. Mobile edge computing technology allows computing power to be allocated at the edge closer to users, which enables efficient data offloading for healthcare systems. However, existing studies on medical data offloading seldom guarantee effective data privacy and security. Moreover, the research equipping data offloading architectures with Blockchain neglect the delay and energy consumption costs incurred in using Blockchain technology for medical data offloading. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data offloading scheme for healthcare based on Blockchain technology, which achieves optimal medical resource allocation and simultaneously minimizes the cost of offloading tasks. Specifically, we design a smart contract to ensure secure data offloading. And, we formulate the cost problem as a Markov Decision Process, solved by a policy search-based deep reinforcement learning (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) scheme, where we jointly consider offloading decisions, allocation of computing resources and radio transmission bandwidth, and Blockchain data security audits. The security of our smart-contract-based mechanism is theoretically and empirically proved, while extensive experimental results also show that our solution can obtain superior performance gains with lower cost than other baselines.},

However, popular sharing platforms like Airbnb or Uber exhibit several drawbacks: a cumbersome sign up procedure, lack of participant privacy, overbearing terms and conditions, and significant fees for users. We demonstrate a Decentralised App (DAPP) for the sharing of everyday objects based on a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract enables users to register and rent devices without involvement of a Trusted Third Party (TTP), disclosure of any personal information or prior sign up to the service. With increasing distribution of cryptocurrencies the use of smart contracts such as proposed in this paper has the potential to revolutionise the sharing economy.},

However, the current performance of blockchain is poor, which becomes a major constraint of its applications. Additionally, different blockchain systems lack standard performance monitoring approach which can automatically adapt to different systems and provide detailed and real-time performance information. To solve this problem, we propose overall performance metrics and detailed performance metrics for the users to know the exact performance in different stages of the blockchain. Then we propose a performance monitoring framework with a log-based method. It has advantages of lower overhead, more details, and better scalability than the previous performance monitoring approaches. Finally we implement the framework to monitor four well-known blockchain systems, using a set of 1,000 open-source smart contracts. The experimental results show that our framework can make detailed and real-time performance monitoring of blockchain systems. We also provide some suggestions for the future development of blockchain systems.},

A previously proposed control algorithm, which exploits the power dependency of the efficiency of electrical energy storages, is implemented as a smart contract on a private instance of an Ethereum blockchain to coordinate the operation. It is implemented using four connected Raspberry Pis representing the participating households with pre-given electrical load and photovoltaic conversion as well as a battery. Each household runs an Ethereum full node and an interfacing software. Only the energy technology components are simulated, while the blockchain is actually running on the Raspberry Pis in order to mind the full complexity of the technology. The practicability is proved in a test run and positive effects on the efficiency and the self-sufficiency within the community are observed.

In order to avoid unreasonably rising costs due to inefficient utilization of the electricity infrastructure, we propose EVA: a scheduling system to solve the valley filling problem by distributing the electricity demand generated by electric vehicles in a geographically limited area efficiently over time spans in which the electric grid is underutilized. EVA is based on a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain in combination with off-chain computational nodes performing the schedule calculation using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This allows for a high degree of transparency and verifiability in the scheduling computation results while maintaining a reasonable level of efficiency. In order to interact with the scheduling system, we developed a decentralized app with a graphical frontend, where the user can enter vehicle information and future energy requirements as well as review upcoming schedules. The calculation of the schedule is performed on a daily basis, continuously providing schedules for participating users for the following day.},

More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a cloud based public key infrastructure utilizing blockchain technology model for replacing the currently outdated traditional variant. Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6\% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87\%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface.},

 abstract = {A blockchain is designed to make consistent and reliable agreement in an unreliable and decentralized environment. It also permits processing transactions, making smart contracts, which allows end users to perform the contracts without any intermediate entities. However, there are some challenges in retrieving the state in a smart contract on the blockchain. For example, an external database or user-defined data structures can be used to retrieve the data from a smart contract in a range, which can increase the management overhead and decrease the overall performance of the blockchain system. In this paper, we propose a scheme that enables SQL query operations in a blockchain system. In our proposed scheme, the register and query managers provide fast retrieval of range data without any user-defined data structure, and management at low cost without any external database, respectively. We have implemented our scheme on quorum which is an Ethereum-based blockchain system and evaluated it using a synthetic benchmark. The experimental results show that our system can improve the search performance up to about 22x compared with the existing system with low memory usage.},

In fact, it is a distributed storage system based on cryptography and consensus algorithms. Currently, many applications have been implemented in finance, agriculture, payment, and medicine area. We proposed a platform called High-value Commodities as a Service (HCS) to combine blockchain and high-value assets together. Traditionally, real estates, jewelry and artworks are main luxuries word-widely. We provide a sound and reliable environment for those investors to trade. Due to characteristics of the blockchain, users on our platform can track the source for each item. And all private data would be pushed on chains which can avoid some privacy-related problems.},

One of the important application of such a system is Smart Power Grid. A critical system like Smart Power Grid requires stringent security measures like immutability of the data sensed by IoT based sensors, verifiability of records etc. It is also important that the system works in a decentralised manner as there are multiple sources of power in a Grid which are from different administrative domain. This paper represents a system which will help to address concerns about security, privacy, Identity along with immutability and verifiability of records. The proposed system allows exchange and collection of data in a decentralized, peer-to-peer, trustless network of devices using BlockChain.},

 abstract = {Sophisticated mass attacks, especially when exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, have the potential to cause destructive damage to organizations and critical infrastructure. To timely detect and contain such attacks, collaboration among the defenders is critical. By correlating real-time detection information (threat indicators) from multiple sources, defenders can detect attacks and take the appropriate measures in time. However, although the technical tools to facilitate collaboration exist, real-world adoption of such collaborative security mechanisms is still underwhelming. This is largely due to a lack of trust and participation incentives for companies and organizations. This paper proposes TRIDEnT, a novel collaborative platform that aims to enable parties to exchange network threat indicators, thus increasing their overall detection capabilities. TRIDEnT allows parties that may be in a competitive relationship, to selectively advertise, sell and acquire threat indicators in the form of (near) real-time peer-to-peer streams. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we instantiate our design in a decentralized manner using Ethereum smart contracts and provide a fully functional prototype.},

The waste management process is very poor, especially when it comes to confirming the correct destination for the delivery of waste. In this work, we are proposing a chain-based approach to waste tracking to enable waste data reporting in a single system. The blockchain is a technology that has already proven itself in the financial sector. It securely records transactions in a large, time-stamped ledger using the proof of work algorithm (PoW), and allows us to write smart contracts on the ethereum network. The application of this technology to the waste sector will enable reliable, transparent and secure recording of all waste movements, thus enabling waste to be traced from source to treatment and disposal. Users will be able to import and export data through a user interface offering different levels of functionality and access. It will also identify and act on illegal wasteful crimes.},

 abstract = {For the sake of enhancing repurchase rate and customer loyalty, plenty of enterprises have issued reward points. However, as there are more enterprises issuing reward points, customers become less and less interested to collect them. Even though there are companies forming a business alliance to make reward points more attractive, it is usually managed by a central leading company. In other words, there still exists a security concern for a centralized system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based cross-organizational integrated platform (BCOIP) for issuing and redeeming reward points. BCOIP provides customers an electronic reward point system that is easier to collect and manage and could circulate in many enterprises. Besides, since BCOIP deploys the smart contract to operate the reward point and make all point transactions stored on the permissioned blockchain, it provides more interoperability and security to enterprises and more credibility for costumers. Moreover, goods providers joining the BCOIP could not only improve the diversity of the reward market but also reach more costumers. Finally, we conduct two experiments to evaluate the efficiency and stability of the BCOIP. Results indicate that points transactions are stable regardless of the number of parallel processes and the other shows the number of nodes has nothing to do with the efficiency of this system.},

 abstract = {Throughout this paper, we try to describe with blockchain technology the decentralization of the internet. A decentralized network that encourages the internet to operate from the smartphone or tablet of anybody instead of centralized servers. A decentralized implementation would be based on a peer-to-peer network that is dependent on a user community. Their machines connected to the internet will host the network, not a community of more powerful servers. Each site would be distributed across thousands of nodes on various devices. The data is therefore not contained, owned by private storage facilities. There is therefore no central point to hack, and no way for an oligarchy of entities to take control of it. A proposed alternative was formed based on a systematic literature review that demonstrates that Internet decentralization is what this modern technology needs in order to address not only the weaknesses of current servers including server down issue, hacking and data manipulation or single point of failure, but also to prevent companies from monetizing the data of citizens through their server and to market them to the advertisers.},

To prevent malicious transactions from getting into blockchains in advance, we propose a runtime hook technique to synchronize and analyze the ongoing transactions exposed to the Ethereum transaction pool. Having a complete view of the past and the ongoing transactions, we can identify and enforce abortion of malicious transactions and prevent losses due to attacks being executed and recorded in the blockchain. Specifically, we modify the Ethereum source code to instrument the entry point of a node to synchronize data received from the Ethereum P2P network and systematically scan suspicious patterns in transactions to identify potential attacks. As a proof-of-the-concept, we show how to deploy the proposed runtime hook system on a private blockchain system, such that we can detect and prevent transactions of double spending on the 51\% attack and reentrancy attack of smart contracts.},

However, as a commercial service, the state-of-the-art payment models for cloud gaming are still in their preliminary stages. In this paper, we reveal the shortages of existing cloud gaming pricing models and propose CloudArcade, a token-based cloud gaming system that employs blockchain-empowered cryptocurrency as a payment method for the players using the cloud gaming services. By using cryptocurrency, CloudArcade provides a transparent and resource-aware pricing method, it also enables a time irrelevant silent payment on the floating price to protects users' payment. These features eliminate the quality of experience degradation caused by the spot price in the traditional dynamic pricing model on the QoE-aware service pricing. We also employ the payment channel in CloudArcade to improve the system performance. Discussions on service pricing criteria are put forward, open issues about token issuing and malicious resource speculation are also reviewed. We believe the design of CloudArcade can show a good generality on other QoE-aware and human-centered applications.},

The problems of traceability, non-counterfeiting and unique usage of digital coupons fall within this area; many couponing platforms are hence exploring the possibility of addressing the above limitations with blockchain technologies. In view of the foregoing, in this work we analyse and compare several blockchain-based couponing systems. To do so, we first propose a general schema of digital coupon and define the desirable properties of a couponing system. Then, we select a sample of these systems and we examine them, describing their design choices and summarizing their relevant properties. Finally, we inspect their code and study how the notion of couponing system is interpreted in their smart contracts. We also highlight their distinctive features and relevant implementation solutions. We conclude by discussing what emerged from our analysis and proposing some possible future investigations.},

 abstract = {Evidence is a tangible demonstrative artifact that proves a fact and shapes the investigation of various misconduct cases involving for instance corruption, misbehavior, or violation. It is imperative to maintain proper evidence management to guarantee the admissibility of an evidence in a court of law. Chain of custody forms the forensic link of evidence sequence of control, transfer, and analysis to preserve evidence's integrity and to prevent its contamination. Blockchain, a distributed tamper-resistant ledger can be leveraged to offer a decentralized secure digital evidence system. In this paper, we propose a secure chain of custody framework by utilizing the blockchain technology to store evidence metadata while the evidence is stored in a reliable storage medium. The framework is built on top of a private Ethereum blockchain to document every transmission from the moment the evidence is seized, thus ensuring that evidence can only be accessed or possessed by authorized parties. The framework is integrated with the digital evidence system where evidence is physically stored and locked using smart locks. To secure the sequence of evidence submission and retrieval, only an authorized party can possess the key to unlock the evidence. Our proposed framework offers a secure solution that maintains evidence integrity and admissibility among multiple stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies, lawyers, and forensic professionals. The research findings shed light on hidden opportunities for the efficient usage of blockchain in other realms beyond finance and cryptocurrencies.},

 abstract = {Numerous supply-chain combines with internet of things (IoT) applications have been proposed, and many methods and algorithms enhance the convenience of supply chains. However, new businesses still find it challenging to enter a supply chain, because unauthorised IoT devices of different companies illegally access resources. As security is paramount in a supply chain, IoT management has become very difficult. Public resources allocation and waste management also pose a problem. To solve the above problems, we proposed a new IoT management framework that embraces blockchain technology to help companies to form a supply chain effectively. This framework consists of an access control system, a backup peer mechanism and an internal data isolation and transmission approach. The access control system has a registrar module and an inspection module. The registrar module is mainly responsible for information registration with a registration policy, which has to be followed by all the companies in the supply chain. Besides, it provides a revocation and updating function. The inspection module focuses on judging misbehaviour and monitors the actions of the subjects; when any misoperation occurs, the system will correspondingly penalise violators. So that all related actions and information are verified and stored into blockchain, the IoT access control and safety of IoT admission are enhanced. Furthermore, in a blockchain system, if one single peer in the network breaks down, then the whole system may stop, because consensus cannot be reached. The data of the broken peer may be lost if it does not commit yet. The backup peer mechanism allows the primary peer and the backup peer to connect to an inspecting server for acquiring real-time data. The internal data isolation and transmission modules transmit and stores private data without creating a new subchannel. The proposed method is taken full account of the stability of the network and the fault tolerance to guarantee the robust of the system. To obtain unbiases results, experiments are conducted in two different blockchain environment. The results show our proposed method are promising IoT blockchain system for the supply chain.},

In this regard, we propose a blockchain-enabled secure communication framework for delivering the goods in COVID-19 like scenarios by leveraging the drones that are available with commercial retail providers. The blockchain scheme is used to create smart contracts to build the trust of buyers and sellers on the framework as the payments are made through the smart contract executions. The blockchain based order processing ensures the integrity and authenticity of the information. Moreover, a communication model is presented along with the order, delivery and payment phases. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by evaluating it based on gas price, transaction time, and mining time.},

Blockchain databases are an emerging and important class of blockchain technology that is critical to the development of non-trivial smart contracts, distributed applications and decentralized marketplaces.In this work, we consider the problem of designing end-to-end encrypted blockchain databases to support the development of decentralized applications that need to store and query sensitive data. In particular, we show how to design what we call blockchain encrypted multi-maps (EMM) which can be used to instantiate various kinds of NoSQL blockchain databases like key-value stores or document databases. We propose three blockchain EMM constructions, each of which achieves different tradeoffs between query, add and delete efficiency. All of our constructions are legacy-friendly in the sense that they can be implemented on top of any existing blockchain. This is particularly challenging since blockchains do not support data deletion.We implemented our schemes on the Algorand blockchain and evaluated their concrete efficiency empirically. Our experiments show that they are practical.},

Therefore, the applications that rely on them will eventually need to migrate from one blockchain instance to another to remain competitive and secure, as well as to enhance the business process, performance, cost efficiency, privacy, and regulatory compliance. However, the differences in data and smart contract representations, modes of hosting, transaction fees, as well as the need to preserve consistency, immutability, and data provenance introduce unique challenges over database migration. We first present a set of blockchain migration scenarios and data fidelity levels using an illustrative example. We then present a set of migration patterns to address those scenarios and the above data management challenges. Finally, we demonstrate how the effort, cost, and risk of migration could be minimized by choosing a suitable set of data migration patterns, data fidelity level, and proactive system design. Practical considerations and research challenges are also highlighted.},

Higher education is a system with many challenges that could be solved by adopting this technology. Protecting data transactions that involve student degrees is one of the challenges considered by educational institutions. Thus, this paper presents a reference architecture proposal based on blockchain technology and a proof of concept to register and consult student certificates issued by higher education institutions. With this architecture, we intend to evaluate a new business model in this technology applied to the educational domain. As a proof of concept, we presented a prototype implementation using smart contracts based on the Ethereum platform and an evaluation made by experts in high education.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals’ quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner’s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.},

 abstract = {Ethereum is a popular account-based blockchain whose number of accounts and transactions has skyrocketed, causing its data explosion. As a result, ordinary clients using PCs or smartphones cannot easily bootstrap as a full node, but rely on other full nodes to verify transactions, thus being exposed to security risks. The most serious overhead is caused by synchronizing the state of all accounts in the block's state trie, which takes several tens of gigabytes. Observing that more than 95\% of the accounts are dormant, we propose a novel state optimization technique, named Ethanos. Ethanos downsizes the state trie by periodically emptying it, and then re-build it only with the active accounts used in the period's transactions. Ethanos runs transactions using the accounts available in the current period's state trie as well as those available at the end of the previous period's state trie. For an account in neither of the tries, the account first restores itself by transmitting a restore transaction. One important result of this state management is that a node can now bootstrap only with the latest period's state trie, yet can fully verify all transactions thereafter. We evaluated Ethanos with real Ethereum transactions for 300,000 blocks from the 7.0 million block, with a one-week period of emptying the state trie. Our result shows that Ethanos can sharply reduce the state trie, with only a tiny fraction of the restore transactions. More importantly, unlike the Ethereum state trie which continues to grow as time goes on, the Ethanos state trie size at the end of each period is bounded by a few hundred MB, when there are more than one million, one-week-active accounts.},

 abstract = {In an effort to contain the Covid-19 pandemic emergency, nations have sponsored smartphones apps tracing contacts. The ultimate aim is to alert people when a Covid-19-positive has been found and it occurs that they have been in close contact with the positive. In the context of contact tracing, transparency of data gathered is of utmost importance to show beyond doubt that the people privacy is preserved as much as possible. The proposed approach aims at making gathered data publicly available in such a way that anonymity is preserved and stored data are immutable and not owned by a single organization. For this, we equip users in a university environment with an app that reveals their presence as a proximity to a WiFi access point. While the server-side provides location ids to apps, the location history is kept within the app and checks for a possible contact are performed by the app. The server aggregates presence data related to each WiFi access point according to time-slots, and stores these periodically in a blockchain for maximum transparency and immutability. The tests on the developed prototype have shown the accuracy in determining presence data, the feasibility for apps to interact with smart contracts and to have daily presence data stored in a blockchain. The ability to exhibit official and immutable statistics on people gathering at university should be useful to give evidence of the effort to have controlled accesses and gathering avoidance.},

This stratified architecture has created data silos that introduce complexities such as limited user control and lack of solicitation regarding the usage of user data. The constant proliferation of IoT devices deployed in smart cities which include smart university campus (SUC) has resulted in the need for the development of IoT architecture models which are data-centric.

Online education (i.e., E-Learning) has become a new type of education model. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, collective maintenance, data disclosure, non-tampering and so on. Its characteristics make it an ideal solution for the existing problems of online education. In this paper, we proposed a new type of decentralized system which called ELMarket(ELM), aiming to solving the problems and deficiencies of existing online educational platforms, including that student user power is insufficient, participants are not interactive enough, and the copyright of educational resources is not protected well.ELM is based on Ethereum to build a private chain called "Intelligence Chain". We released circulating tokens which called ELStone(ELS) on the "Intelligence Chain" as an incentive to users. The system also proposed and widely applied the concept of "Smart Market". In order to protect teachers' creative rights and stimulate students' interests in learning, we have also added several mechanisms such as originality detection, review of users’ behavior and credits exchange. In addition, we combine IPFS and relational database to store, making up for the lack that blockchain cannot store large files. In the end, ELM established a safe, transparent, efficient, and non-tamperable online education ecosystem.},

However, the security concerns with this protocol have presented vital security challenges in most IoT applications. For example, the MQTT protocol does not have secure authentication mechanisms implemented and leaves that task to the developer as all the included native security services are fragile. This paper will present a well-thought approach involving a lightweight authentication and authorization scheme together with a decentralized identity system to manage the users' identities. This mechanism helps in facilitating the authentication for both subscribers and publishers by utilizing a smart contract in Ethereum blockchain to guarantee trust, accountability and preserve user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to prove our work, which involves a decentralized MQTT platform and dashboard using our approach. The usability of this approach was further analyzed, particularly concerning CPU and memory utilization.

This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework, \DH{}Archer, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have evaluated \DH{}Archer on 11 popular real-world DApps. \DH{}Archer achieves high precision (99.3\%), recall (87.6\%), and accuracy (89.4\%) in bug detection and significantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs in the 11 DApps. So far, six of the 15 bugs have been confirmed by the developers, and three have been fixed. These promising results demonstrate the usefulness of \DH{}Archer.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is undoubtedly one of the most potentially attractive technologies for the organization of financial services. The significance of the Blockchain technology in a banking system can be determined by three main principles that is; Disintermediation, Transparency and Provenance. The DLT (distributed ledger technology) eliminates the need for trust enforcer in the banking management system. This is made possible by the tamper- proof data in the distributed data records and all the participants in the network have the same version of data record with them at all times and it is unalterable. Blockchain promotes a public database record of all the customer transactions and other data, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy system as the customers have a 24x7 real-time access to it. Blockchain keeps an immutable distributed data ledger of transactions and this result in maintaining a lifecycle of the assets and its ownership from its first transaction to the most recent one. It reduces the chances of occurrence of theft, insurance fraud and misselling of the high valued assets or intellectual properties. Blockchain can be implemented in the banking sector for various applications like maintenance of data confidentiality, cheque clearing system, real time money transfer system (digital currency), supply chain finance, insurance, trade finance, KYC (know your customer), cross-border payments/transactions system, monitoring of consortium accounts, auction system and digital asset management. Blockchain technology can hence enable a decentralized solution for the banking ecosystem. The proposed system enables one platform for both the lenders and the borrowers to initiate their money transaction for lending, borrowing and repayment of the loan money. The transactions made throughout, that is, from the start to the last repayment can be viewed easily on a blockchain network thus increasing the transparency and trust of the customers and it resolves any disputes that can arise in the loan system. Along with this, a KYC registry based on blockchain is also proposed which will help in maintaining the KYC details in one platform which can be accessed by various banks for identification and verification of the customer in an easy and faster manner. It will increase the customer satisfaction as there will be no need for the customer to perform a KYC check every time he/she creates a bank account in any bank as the bank can easily access their KYC details from this system.},

 abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution for training using data collected from heterogeneous sources (e.g., mobile devices) while avoiding the transmission of large amounts of raw data and preserving privacy. Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that the integration of blockchain and smart contract technologies to FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present FL-MAB (FL- Multi-Auction using Blockchain), a client selection mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. FL-MAB employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract. This allows FL-MAB to measure the relative contribution of each client by calculating a Shapley value, and allocating rewards accordingly. We have implemented FL-MAB using Solidity and tested on the Ethereum blockchain with various popular datasets. Our results show that FL-MAB outperforms existing baseline schemes by improving accuracy and reducing the no. of FL rounds.},

Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a medical record that can be accessed and have certain limitations. The challenge in implementing MR is how to be able to collect, store, and analyze patient data in a comprehensive and integrated manner without having to violate patient privacy. The implementation of MR is how to transmit data between hospitals. To solve the problems and issues faced in implementing MR, there is a technology that can overcome this, one of which is using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that managed by many participants in an availability manner. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that anyone can use to create and deploy decentralized applications that run on the blockchain network. The data stored on the Ethereum blockchain will always be there and can be seen as long as the blockchain network is still online. With ethereum, the process of sharing data will be easy to do using a computer belonging to the hospital as a blockchain node. The result of implementing blockchain into medical record is now the data can be shared securely between hospitals.},

 abstract = {We propose Shard Scheduler, a system for object placement and migration in account-based sharded blockchains. Our system calculates optimal placement and decides on object migrations across shards. It supports complex multi-account transactions caused by smart contracts. Placement and migration decisions made by Shard Scheduler are fully deterministic, verifiable, and can be made part of the consensus protocol. Shard Scheduler reduces the number of costly cross-shard transactions, ensures balanced load distribution and maximizes the number of processed transactions for the blockchain as a whole. To this end, it leverages a novel incentive model motivating miners to maximize the global throughput of the entire blockchain rather than the throughput of a specific shard. In our simulations, Shard Scheduler can reduce the number of costly cross-shard transactions by half while ensuring equal load and increasing throughput more than 2 fold when using 60 shards. We also implement and evaluate Shard Scheduler on Chainspace, more than doubling its throughput and reducing user-perceived latency by 70\% when using 10 shards.},

Ethereum, a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contracts, introduces an interesting ecosystem of human users and autonomous agents (the contracts). It is the most actively used blockchain platform, hosting ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as its native store of value. The Ethereum blockchain contains a vast amount of user-to-user, user-to-contract, contract-to -user, and contract-to-contract interactions that can be modeled as complex networks. To mine these interactions as graphs through a preferred analytics toolbox, an end-user has to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the required data into the desired network format. However, it is costly and time-consuming to manage the ETL pipeline for the massive and complex blockchain data. To support research in this domain, we develop an end-to-end, automated tool - EtherNet, which performs ETL tasks from a single source of truth (Google BigQuery), and provides graph equivalent representations for visualization and mining on the entire Ethereum blockchain network.},

 abstract = {At present, using a large number of unsafe IoT devices to form botnets and launching DDoS attacks have become one of the main threats to IoT security. However, most of the existing DDoS attack defense methods are limited to being implemented within a single controller management network domain. In fact, many IoT devices that attackers build botnets are usually located in the jurisdiction of different controllers. Therefore, a mechanism is needed for each domain to cooperate with each other and share information about the attack source, so as to realize the defense against DDoS attacks across multiple domains. Blockchain technology's decentralization and group trusted collaboration mechanism provide a new method for solving cross-domain DDoS attack defense. This article combines SDN and blockchain with IoT, and proposes a cross-domain collaborative DDoS defense scheme based on blockchain and SDN architecture. It allows multiple SDN-based domains to collaborate with each other and share attack source information in a decentralized manner, making collaborative DDoS attack defense across multiple domains more flexible. Experimental results show that the defense mechanism has flexibility, feasibility, and safety.},

In addition, candidates submit malicious incorrect registration information to disrupt recruitment, which not only increases the workload of reviewers, but also affects the efficiency of recruitment. Candidates need to upload scanned copies of certification materials (such as ID card, degree certificate, graduation certificate, etc.) when registering. Some candidates are worried about whether the information will be leaked and the reviewers are unfair in reviewing for personal gains. In response to these problems, this article proposes to add text recognition to the recruitment management system of a university teacher to complete the system's automatic registration review.

 abstract = {A key challenge in engineering distributed systems consists in the integration into their development of a decentralised infrastructure allowing the system participants to trust each other. In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.},

 abstract = {Financial institutions own balanced portfolios with different types of assets, resulting in a low-risk investment. At the same time, assets cannot be broken down into smaller parts with comparable risk for resale owing to regulators’ restrictions caused by a lack of auditability. Blockchain overcomes this issue with smart contracts. By now, the way to tokenize financial assets into a commodity is known. In this paper, we provide technical details for tokenization. Namely, an artificial dataset from Forex data is constructed for demonstration purposes; two tokenization algorithms are implemented and applied to the dataset; ERC1155-based smart contract is implemented and applied to the algorithms’ output to perform sold-out and secondary market steps. The source code is openly available.},

 abstract = {There is a rising concern about authorization in IoT environments to be appropriately designed and applied, due to smart things surge to be part of people's daily lives on one hand, and the amount of personal/private information they utilize, on the other hand. Different access control systems have been proposed for different IoT environments, many are remaining only at a conceptual level. In this paper, we propose a decentralized, ledger-based, publish-subscribe based architecture for the administration of access in a smart home IoT environment to preside at the assignments of underlying operational authorizations. Proposed architecture is endorsed by a proof-of-concept implementation, which utilizes smart contracts to ensure the integrity of administration supplemented by intrinsic benefits of blockchain to be distributed and transparent. Despite the rising hype around the blockchain technology that stokes its utilization in different domains, utilizing it for access control purposes is not yet promising. Our implementation results assure using blockchain for administrative access control is propitious, while is not yet appropriate for operational access control, which have been mainly the focus of previously proposed blockchain-based access control works.},

The data stored in blockchain can be considered as big data -- massive-volume, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Due to highly connected structure, graph-based modeling is an optimal tool to analyze the data stored in blockchains. Recently, several research works performed graph analysis on the publicly available blockchain data to reveal insights into its business transactions and for critical downstream tasks, e.g., cryptocurrency price prediction, phishing scams and counterfeit token detection. In this tutorial, we discuss relevant literature on blockchain data structures, storage, categories, data extraction and graphs construction, graph mining, topological data analysis, and machine learning methods used, target applications, and the new insights revealed by them, aiming towards providing a clear view of unified graph-data models for UTXO and account-based blockchains.

 abstract = {DNS has often been criticized for inherent design flaws, which make the system vulnerable to attack. Further, domain names are not fully controlled by users, meaning that they can easily be taken down by authorities and registrars. Due to this, there have been efforts to build a decentralized name service that gives greater control to domain owners. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a major example. Yet, no existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, particularly regarding security and misbehavior. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement study of ENS. Our findings suggest that ENS has shown growth during its four years' evolution. We identify several security issues, including traditional name system problems, as well as new issues introduced by the unique properties of ENS. We find that attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS names, a number of scam blockchain addresses and indexing of malicious websites. We further develop a new record persistence attack, to find that 22,716 .eth names (3.7\% of all names) are vulnerable to name hijacking. Our exploration suggests that our community should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of issues in decentralized name services.},

 abstract = {Access control languages are traditionally based on centralized trust models when achieving their security goals. One important reason for a lack of decentralized trust models for access control has been difficulties in referring to and accessing cryptographic key material in a decentralized fashion. This lack of a working and secure decentralized public key infrastructure could be fatal for projects like Berners-Lee’s Solid. To solve this problem, we propose repurposing the access control scheme SDSI (Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure). SDSI is a long-standing and well-studied alternative to the hierarchical PKI infrastructure, but it failed to be adopted due to problems with key discovery and revocation, both of which can be solved with blockchain technology. In this concept note, we outline the next steps for how SDSI could be used as a decentralized trust model using blockchain technology.},

@article{10.1145/3542949,
 abstract = {Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.},

 abstract = {The blockchain-powered decentralized applications and systems have been widely deployed in recent years. The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4\% of wallets and 83.5\% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.},

Among these, Web3 social media platforms have begun to emerge. These store all social interaction data (e.g., posts) on a public ledger, removing the need for centralized data ownership and management. But this comes at a cost, which some argue is prohibitively expensive. As an exemplar within this growing ecosytem, we explore memo.cash, a microblogging service built on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. We gather data for 24K users, 317K posts, 2.57M user actions, which have facilitated $6.75M worth of transactions. A particularly unique feature is that users must pay BCH tokens for each interaction (e.g., posting, following). We study how this may impact the social makeup of the platform. We therefore study memo.cash as both a social network and a transaction platform.},

 abstract = {Web3, based on blockchain technology, is the evolving next generation Internet of value. Massive active applications on Web3, e.g. DeFi and NFT, usually rely on blockchain transactions to achieve value transfer as well as complex and diverse custom logic and intentions. Various risky or illegal behaviors such as financial fraud, hacking, money laundering are currently rampant in the blockchain ecosystem, and it is thus important to understand the intent behind the pseudonymous transactions. To reveal the intent of transactions, much effort has been devoted to extracting some particular transaction semantics through specific expert experiences. However, the limitations of existing methods in terms of effectiveness and generalization make it difficult to extract diverse transaction semantics in the rapidly growing and evolving Web3 ecosystem. In this paper, we propose the Motif-based Transaction Semantics representation method (MoTS), which can capture the transaction semantic information in the real-time transaction data workflow. To the best of our knowledge, MoTS is the first general semantic extraction method in Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Experimental results show that MoTS can effectively distinguish different transaction semantics in real-time, and can be used for various downstream tasks, giving new insights to understand the Web3 blockchain ecosystem.

However, for this technology to permeate the mainstream, blockchain technology should be easily accessible to the general public. This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps.

 abstract = {There is an increasingly diverse range of smart-contract blockchains on which decentralized applications (dApps) are built. However, HCI research has so far failed to address them, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is problematic as these new blockchains come with an increasingly diverse set of properties that influence the usability of dApps for end-users. For blockchain interface design guidelines to be valuable for practitioners, they need to acknowledge the heterogeneity of blockchains. However, evaluating novel interface concepts across different blockchains is resource-intensive as each blockchain has to be integrated manually, slowing down research. To address this challenge, we propose a system to support interface experimentation for blockchain applications. The system allows researchers and developers to connect interfaces to a unified API simulating different blockchains and facilitates the configuration, distribution, and evaluation of online experiments. A preliminary evaluation showed promising results.},

 abstract = {In migrating and upgrading an Ethereum smart contract, it is necessary to transfer both the code as well as the stored data. Various methods attempt to migrate or upgrade a smart contract, but they are mostly manual, error-prone, and applicable only before deployment. Further, they have challenges in extracting the storage state of complex mapping data structures along with their keys. In this work, we present Smartmuv as an automatic source-code-based static analysis tool to analyze and extract the state from the storage-trie of smart contracts. Based on the abstract syntax tree and the control flow graphs of the Solidity source code, the tool analyzes each state variable including mapping types along the inheritance hierarchy. It also provides the upgrade algorithm that initializes the extracted state in the constructor of new smart contract. Smartmuv safely approximates the origin of the keys used in the mapping to extract values and has been able to extract the mapping state of 23,673 smart contracts with 95.7\% overall precision. Moreover, we also validate the Smartmuv’s extracted state with the third-party tool Etherscan.},

 abstract = {The deployment and management of Blockchain applications require non-trivial efforts given the unique characteristics of their infrastructure (i.e., immutability) and the complexity of the software systems being executed. The operation of Blockchain applications is still based on ad-hoc solutions that are error-prone, difficult to maintain and evolve, and do not manage their interactions with other infrastructures (e.g., a Cloud backend).This paper proposes KATENA, a framework for the deployment and management of Blockchain applications. In particular, it focuses on applications that are compatible with Ethereum, a popular general-purpose Blockchain technology. KATENA provides i) a metamodel for defining Blockchain applications, ii) a set of processes to automate the deployment and management of defined models, and iii) an implementation of the approach based on TOSCA, a standard language for Infrastructure-as-Code, and xOpera, a TOSCA-compatible orchestrator. To evaluate the approach, we applied KATENA to model and deploy three real-world Blockchain applications, and showed that our solution reduces the amount of code required for their operations up to 82.7\%.},

 abstract = {The design of tokenomics, i.e., distribution and circulation mechanisms of cryptocurrency tokens, is a top priority for almost all Web3 applications which relates to their own economic systems via native cryptocurrency tokens. Unfortunately, while the sustainability of tokenomics largely determines the long-term development of a Web3 application, the tooling support for the design of it has been far too insufficient. A common practice at the time of writing is to specify tokenomics with a combination of documents, spreadsheets, code scripts etc.. In this paper, we introduce the TMI development platform for the modelling and analysis of Web3 tokenomics. TMI creates a domain-specific language and its graphical development environment for developers to succinctly model crypto-economic relations in a drag-and-drop way. Based on created models, TMI allows developers to formally analyse their tokenomics via checking fundamental economic properties, e.g., The core team of a project holds less than 20\% of the project token in 36 months. A demonstration video of TMI is available at https://youtu.be/LDn-eRxPMTw.},

 abstract = {With the recent advent of blockchains, we have witnessed a plethora of blockchain proposals. These proposals range from using work to using time, storage or stake in order to select blocks to be appended to the chain. As a drawback it makes it difficult for the application developer to choose the right blockchain to support their applications. In particular, the scalability and performance one can obtain from a specific blockchain is typically unknown. The claimed results are often obtained in isolation by the developers of the blockchain themselves. The experimental conditions corresponding to these results are generally missing and the lack of details make these results irreproducible.In this paper, we propose the most extensive evaluation of blockchain to date. First, we show how the experimental settings impact the performance of 6 state-of-the-art blockchains and argue for more detailed experiments. Second, and to cope with this limitation, we propose a unifying framework to evaluate blockchains on the same ground. The framework includes a suite of 5 realistic Decentralized Applications (DApps), helps deploy the blockchain nodes at different scales and evaluate their performance. Finally, we show that selecting a particular virtual machine or weakening guarantees can help handle computationally demanding workloads but that none of the tested blockchains can yet support the load of these realistic DApps.},

 abstract = {Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.},

@article{10.1145/3555126,
 abstract = {The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

In this sense, digitization has become a relevant factor for the improvement of processes in several aspects of document management. In this context, blockchain is relevant due to its ability to meet the requirements of any document management solutions. However, there are still difficulties in the efficiency of blockchain infrastructure implementation. On the other hand, existing solutions present proposals for specific contexts and strict business rules. Therefore, this study proposes an architecture designed to provide and facilitate the integration of blockchain-based document registration and verification for use by third-party applications from different domains. Furthermore, this solution allows the configuration of parameters in creating customizable document templates and selecting blockchains. To evaluate the proposed solution, we performed performance tests for different scenarios and blockchains, demonstrating differences between public and private blockchains when performing read and write operations.},

This paper proposes a data privacy protection and fingerprint tracing method based on the features of decentralization, traceability and non-tampering in blockchain technology. And we combined with the protection of data by secure network platform in trusted computing and differential-traceability algorithm (DTA). We propose a data privacy protection and fingerprint traceability method, and use the SkipList table index structure to improve interaction efficiency.

In this paper, the data can be processed safely and efficiently to solve the privacy problem, the transaction data is encrypted and recorded on the chain by DTA, and the interaction process uses the SkipList table index to enhance retrieval efficiency. Finally, through multiple experiments and comparison of the results obtained from security testing, it is verified that the blockchain-trusted computing data privacy protection and data fingerprint traceability SkipList table indexing method can achieve traceability for data privacy protection, transaction security management and peer-to-peer verification of encryption and decryption algorithms. We not only provide a secure, trustworthy and efficient data privacy protection model, but also bring a time efficiency optimization of 6ms per 10,000 queries.},

 abstract = {We study the competition between blockchains in a multi-chain environment, where a dominant EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) co-exists with an alternative EVM-compatible (e.g., Avalanche) and an EVM-incompatible (e.g., Algorand) blockchain. While EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum users and developers to migrate more easily over to the alternative layer-1, EVM incompatibility might allow the firms to build more loyal and "sticky'' user base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such, the choice to be EVM-compatible is not merely a technological decision, but also an important strategic decision. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and find that at equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain. To avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice can take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network effects. We find that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract users through direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract users through offering better features/products.},

It is often challenging to find a suitable donor in case of emergency. The situation is worse if it is a rare blood group. This paper introduces a blockchain-based decentralised application (DApp) to match recipients with blood donors during an emergency. Personal information such as name, location, blood group, and donation history is stored securely in the blockchain distributed ledger through IPFS. The donors' lack of awareness and motivation are the primary reasons for people not coming forward for blood donations. We propose to gamify the blood donation process by issuing NFT badges as a reward for donors. This paper explains the design of smart contracts for storing donor and recipient data on the ledger and issuing NFTs to donors. The article also briefly discusses the process of designing the DApp.},

Reliable machine-to-machine automatic transactions, such as auctions, bidding, and payments, utilise the immense potential of blockchain technology. Researchers are exploring blockchain-based applications for automobiles and transportation, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and highway user fee payment. The use of blockchain eliminates the need for third parties in transactions. This paper presents a proof of concept for using EVs as energy storage in a smart grid system. Generators, consumers, and distributed energy resources (DER), such as solar and wind, make up the elements of a smart grid. We propose storing the surplus power generated by DER in the electric vehicle's battery. When the generation is less, or there is high demand, these EVs can supply the stored energy back to the grid. We use blockchain smart contracts and Ethereum cryptocurrency to monitor and monetise the process. We also make a cost comparison of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs, analysing the financial benefits of employing the suggested method in EV charging instead of more conventional charging methods.},

 abstract = {Securing and managing medical data in hospitals is one of the significant challenges still existing in healthcare. There can be different kinds of patients staying in hospitals with various diseases. All these medical data records need to be secured appropriately for future use and verification. In the hospital, there will be essential documents such as criminal cases and postmortem reports, although it is unclear if they are being handled properly or not. Even the hospital staff can alter these data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based secured medical data management system to manage access to each medical record in a network of hospitals. The proposed system has three main access management categories: one for securing general (fever or cold) medical report, category 2 for postmortem or crime reports security and category 3 for securing cancer /brain death /genetic disorder reports. Sensitive clinical data should not be visible to patients with cancer or genetic disorders as these patients have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Hence, the data is accessible only to doctors, family members, and researchers. The data related to the crime or postmortem reports have only limited access for those with legal permission to access and verify these types of reports. So through blockchain distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, we could store the data in a tamper-proof manner and manage the user access to these data.},

 abstract = {In the past, the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)” was used to refer to a loosely organized network of autonomous entities, such as a corporation, a cooperative, or a non-profit party. Since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs. The EVM can also run other applications such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a new type of blcokchain-based organization that uses smart contracts to perform tasks on a distributed scale. The smart contracts have organizational rules and operational logic embedded and automatically execute organizational decisions and proposals making it highly decentralized and more democratic. The DAOs are organizations that are not subject to legal, physical, or economic constraints, as well as the ability to operate outside the control of a single central authority or a single governing body. Because DAO is formed by many smart contract that operate together, which makes it highly decentralized and has a strong democratic system. This paper discusses the pros and cons of DAO, and the potential of DAO in community development, especially in non-profit organizations. It is hope to provide an overall picture of DAO, and the roadmap for future development of DAO on the right track.},

 abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – an ecosystem of financial applications built on top of blockchain technology – has kept powering ahead and attracted a large amount of capital in just a few years. As the core part of the DeFi ecosystem, decentralized lending protocols allow users to become lenders or borrowers in a completely decentralized fashion, such that an individual has complete control over their funds at all times. Collecting, analyzing, and visualizing lending data are crucial as these lending protocols are growing steadily. This paper presents an analysis model for decentralized lending protocols. Our main contributions are as follows. (i) We analyze and compare the top lending protocols; (ii) We present a general model to collect and process a large amount of data from multiple lending protocols in an exact and efficient manner; (iii) We design and implement a lending visualization system with various charts divided into three categories, i.e., lending market overview, token analysis, and user analysis.},

 abstract = {Block-STM is a parallel execution engine for smart contracts, built around the principles of Software Transactional Memory. Transactions are grouped in blocks, and every execution of the block must yield the same deterministic outcome. Block-STM further enforces that the outcome is consistent with executing transactions according to a preset order, leveraging this order to dynamically detect dependencies and avoid conflicts during speculative transaction execution. At the core of Block-STM is a novel, low-overhead collaborative scheduler of execution and validation tasks.Block-STM is implemented on the main branch of the Diem Blockchain code-base and runs in production at Aptos. Our evaluation demonstrates that Block-STM is adaptive to workloads with different conflict rates and utilizes the inherent parallelism therein. Block-STM achieves up to 110k tps in the Diem benchmarks and up to 170k tps in the Aptos Benchmarks, which is a 20x and 17x improvement over the sequential baseline with 32 threads, respectively. The throughput on a contended workload is up to 50k tps and 80k tps in Diem and Aptos benchmarks, respectively.},

 abstract = {With the explosion of COVID-19 cases and the government’s needs to control virus spreading, the development of effective and robust systems for managing vaccination certificates to restrict citizens’ activities has been in the centre of many governments. This paper proposes a system that allows for the update of the status of certificates and bases its function on a specific form of logs stored on Blockchains and a set of rules for the interpretation of these logs. Also an outline of a proof of concept implementation of the system in Ethereum together with a cost and security analysis are provided in the paper. The proposed architecture provides several benefits with the most prominent one being the suspension of certificates in case an already vaccinated individual is found positive. In existing certificate management systems a vaccinated individual that is tested positive still holds a valid vaccination certificate during the self-isolation period. This vulnerability allows infected individuals to commute freely and thus facilitates the spread of the pandemic. The proposed solution is not limited to COVID-19 related certificates, but rather it could be deployed in any kind of digital certificate.},

 abstract = {Web3 applications based on blockchains regularly need access to randomness that is unbiased, unpredictable, and publicly verifiable. For Web3 gaming applications, this becomes a crucial selling point to attract more users by providing credibility to the "random reward" distribution feature. A verifiable random function (VRF) protocol satisfies these requirements naturally, and there is a tremendous rise in the use of VRF services. As most blockchains cannot maintain the secret keys required for VRFs, Web3 applications interact with external VRF services via a smart contract where a VRF output is exchanged for a fee. While this smart contract-based plain-text exchange offers the much-needed public verifiability immediately, it severely limits the way the requester can employ the VRF service: the requests cannot be made in advance, and the output cannot be reused. This introduces significant latency and monetary overhead.This work overcomes this crucial limitation of the VRF service by introducing a novel privacy primitive Output Private VRF ( Pri-VRF) and thereby adds significantly more flexibility to the Web3-based VRF services. We call our framework FlexiRand. While maintaining the pseudo-randomness and public verifiability properties of VRFs, FlexiRand ensures that the requester alone can observe the VRF output. The smart contract and anybody else can only observe a blinded-yet-verifiable version of the output. We formally define Pri-VRF, put forward a practically efficient design, and provide provable security analysis in the universal composability (UC) framework (in the random oracle model) using a variant of one-more Diffie-Hellman assumption over bilinear groups.As the VRF service, with its ownership of the secret key, becomes a single point of failure, it is realized as a distributed VRF with the key secret-shared across distinct nodes in our framework. We develop our distributed Pri-VRF construction by combining approaches from Distributed VRF and Distributed Oblivious PRF literature. We provide provable security analysis (in UC), implement it and compare its performance with existing distributed VRF schemes. Our distributed Pri-VRF only introduces a minimal computation and communication overhead for the VRF service, the requester, and the contract.},

 abstract = {Public auditing and data deduplication are integral considerations in providing efficient and secure cloud storage services. Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

 abstract = {The development of the Internet has revolutionized the news industry. While bringing various advantages, it has also caused an overflow of fake and malicious news, which has damaged social and economic benefits. In recent years, new news detection schemes are constantly proposed. In the scheme based on artificial detection, blockchain has become an important infrastructure and tool. Because blockchain is open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and traceable, it has important use value in the scenario of artificial detection, which requires the consensus of multiple entities. However, most of the current blockchain-based solutions focus on ex-ante detection, and they do not implement fine-grained detection division. Obviously, one validator cannot detect the authenticity of all types of news, which leads to a reduction in the credibility of the detection results. In this paper, we propose a framework for news full lifecycle management. First, the news is matched with the professional validators through a fine-grained detection control strategy. Then, based on sealed bid auction and secret sharing technology, a Six-stage Submission Protocol is proposed, which places the validator's consensus process off-chain, saving transaction costs and ensuring the credibility of the detection results. We analyzed the cost and performance of the proposed framework, and the results proved its correctness and feasibility.},

The most significant way to improve the business is by impressing customers and keeping them satisfied. If customers cannot get the service, they turn to the competitors. The first step to their satisfaction is the fulfillment of the promises made by the business. The customers come to the service with certain expectations. And one of the most crucial expectations is getting the service when they need it. Any compromise with availability has serious effects on business. Therefore, it is important to control and ensure the availability of the company’s service from necessary places on the planet. For checking the availability of the service, the organization can implement the approach of using special internet services, but they do not look reliable. To increase trust between the parties, it is necessary to implement blockchain technology. The paper presents the blockchain-based availability testing service. The service allows organizations not only to verify the accuracy of the work done but also allows checking the availability from the special places.},

 abstract = {The growing popularity of online social media (OSM) has led to the creation of a wide amount of social media platforms. In this context, the increasing competition among platforms and the emergence of decentralized alternatives such as Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM), have led to more frequent user migrations: individuals tend to switch platforms in search of improved features, content, or communities. Therefore there has been increasing interest in user migration studies modeling and predicting user migration. However, user migration, especially in blockchain-based platforms remains an understudied problem. Existing methods rely on user activity to derive interaction graphs and then address the user migration prediction problem as a node classification task, where user decisions are encoded as node labels. While the performance look promising, there are currently two important research gaps: i) there is no work using graph neural networks, the state-of-the-art in machine learning on graphs; and ii) there is a lack of methods designed to improve prediction performance in the case of class imbalance, i.e. the presence of dominant behavior among the ones to predict. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict user migration in BOSM. We model the data as a directed temporal multilayer graph, capturing social and monetary interactions among users. To address the problem of class imbalance in node classification, we introduce a data-level balancing technique following an undersampling approach. The evaluation, conducted on data describing user migration across blockchain online social media platforms, shows that graph neural networks are a suitable machine learning approach to perform user migration prediction. Furthermore, the proposed undersampling approach improves predictive power on severely imbalanced data. These results highlight how graph neural networks are effective in predicting user migration, without the need for manual feature engineering and in the absence of user information. Our methodology holds potential for applications beyond user migration, such as fraud detection and bot detection, and opens up venues for further research in other prediction tasks in online social networks and blockchain-based systems.},

 abstract = {Ethereum blockchain has shown great potential in providing the next generation of the decentralized platform beyond crypto payments. Recently, it has attracted researchers and industry players to experiment with developing various Web3 applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), Defi, Metaverse, and many more. Although Ethereum provides a secure platform for developing decentralized applications, it is not immune to security risks and has been a victim of numerous cyber attacks. Adversarial attacks are a new cyber threat to systems that have been rising. Adversarial attacks can disrupt and exploit decentralized applications running on the Ethereum platform by creating fake accounts and transactions. Detecting adversarial attacks is challenging because the fake materials (e.g., accounts and transactions) as malicious payloads are similar to benign data. This article proposes a model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for cyber threat hunting in the Ethereum blockchain. Firstly, we employ GAN to generate fake transactions using genuine Ethereum transactions as the first phase of the proposed model. Then in the second phase, we utilize bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to identify adversarial transactions in a hunting exercise. The results of the first phase evaluation show that the GAN can generate transactions identical to the actual Ethereum transactions with an accuracy of 82.51\%. Also, the results of the second phase show 99.98\% accuracy in identifying adversarial transactions.},

However, due to security considerations and consistency requirements, smart contracts currently only support simple and deterministic programs, which significantly hinders their deployment in intelligent Web 3.0 applications. To enhance smart contracts intelligence on the blockchain, we propose SMART, a plug-in smart contract framework that supports efficient AI model inference while being compatible with existing blockchains. To handle the high complexity of model inference, we propose an on-chain and off-chain joint execution model, which separates the SMART contract into two parts: the deterministic code still runs inside an on-chain virtual machine, while the complex model inference is offloaded to off-chain compute nodes. To solve the non-determinism brought by model inference, we leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to endorse the integrity and correctness of the off-chain execution. We also design distributed attestation and secret key provisioning schemes to further enhance the system security and model privacy. We implement a SMART prototype and evaluate it on a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchain. Theoretical analysis and prototype evaluation show that SMART not only achieves the security goals of correctness, liveness, and model privacy, but also has approximately 5 orders of magnitude faster inference efficiency than existing on-chain solutions.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, top-level domains (TLDs) are managed by the Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (ICANN), and the domain names under them are managed by registrars. Against such a centralized management, a blockchain naming service (BNS) has been proposed to manage TLDs on blockchains without authority intervention. BNS users can register TLD strings as non-fungible tokens and manage the TLD root zone. However, such a decentralized management results in the introduction of a new security issue, BNS TLD name collision, wherein the same TLD is registered in several different BNSs. In this study, we investigated BNS TLD name collisions by analyzing TLDs registered on two BNSs: Handshake and Decentraweb. Specifically, we collected TLDs registered in Handshake and Decentraweb and the associated data, and analyzed the data registration status of BNS TLDs and BNS TLD name collisions. The analysis of 11,595,406 Handshake and 11,889 Decentraweb TLDs revealed 6,973 BNS TLD name collisions. In particular, lastname TLDs, which are intended for use as person names, yielded a large number of registered domain names. In addition, the analysis identified 10 name collisions between the BNS and operational ICANN TLDs. Further, the ICANN TLD candidates under review also had name collisions against the BNS TLDs. Consequently, based on the characteristics of these name collisions and discussions in BNS communities, we considered countermeasures against BNS TLD name collisions. For the further development of BNSs, we believe that it is essential to discuss with the existing Internet communities and coexist with the existing Internet.},

This paper presents the first census-like quantitative analysis of the whole ecosystem of DAOs, including 30K DAO communities on the main DAO platforms. This enables us to provide insights into the allegedly "democratic'' nature of DAOs, building metrics concerning their lifespan, participation, and power concentration. Most DAOs have a short lifespan and low participation. There is also a positive correlation between community size and voting power concentration. Like other online communities, DAOs seem to follow the iron law: becoming increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Still, a significant amount of DAOs of varying sizes defy this idea by being egalitarian by design.},

 abstract = {Vehicle based logistics are hinged on their ability to timely deliver goods, services, and people. The classical expression of “time is money” comes alive in the logistics industry yielding potentially huge financial and health consequences in case of missing deadlines. This is especially the case for time sensitive pharmaceuticals, delivery of perishable goods, delivery of people travelling, delivery of services in fault fixing/recovery sector. All these use cases motivate the need for an immutable, secure, and immortalized process of tracking time. To solve this challenge, this paper presents prototype-based research that integrates the 4th industrial revolution technologies of vision Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and blockchain. The developed prototype features a Raspberry-PI board embedding a camera, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to recognize plate letters from the image and a crypto wallet to sign the logging of plate number and time events on the NEAR blockchain, an emerging sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain that is simple to use, secure and scalable. The effective operation of the developed prototype has been validated inside a campus parking and shows an accuracy of 80\%. The benefits of transparency, security, and immutability of the blockchain combined with the intelligence, data capture, and processing of IoT will enable to develop accountability solutions trusted by all different logistic stakeholders.},

 abstract = {In recent years, edge-based smart unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery systems have attracted a lot of attention by both academia and industry given its promising business value and also as an ideal testbed for many emerging technologies such as edge computing, blockchain and machine learning. At the moment, one of the critical challenges for smart UAV delivery systems is data privacy since the massive amount of data is being generated by both users and UAVs and the data is used for training machine learning models to support various smart applications such as autonomous navigation, facial recognition, and person re-identification (ReID). To tackle such a challenge, federated learning (FL) has been widely used as a promising solution since it only needs to share and update model parameters with the centralised server without transmitting the raw data. However, conventional FL still faces the issue of the single-point-of-failure. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose BDFL, a Blockchain-enabled decentralised FL framework for edge-based smart UAV delivery systems. In our framework, Blockchain provides a decentralised network for FL to eliminate the need for a centralised server and store private data in the decentralised permissioned Blockchain to avoid the single-point-of-failure. To motivate our study and analyse the privacy concerns, we employ the person ReID application in smart UAV delivery systems as a typical example. In addition, we also provide the customised proof of quality factor (cPoQF) consensus protocol to address the scalability issue of the Blockchain in order to support the increasing number of smart applications in UAV delivery system. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through experiments on energy efficiency, confirmation time and throughput, with further discussion on the impact of the incentive mechanism, and the analysis of its resiliency under various security attacks.},

 abstract = {Security and privacy are primary concerns in IoT management. Security breaches in IoT resources, such as smart sensors, can leak sensitive data and compromise the privacy of individuals. Effective IoT management requires a comprehensive approach to prioritize access security and data privacy protection. Digital twins create virtual representations of IoT resources. Blockchain adds decentralization, transparency, and reliability to IoT systems. This research integrates digital twins and blockchain to manage access to IoT data streaming. Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration. The research presented in this paper enables multitenant access and customization of data streaming views and abstracts the complexity of data access management. This approach provides access and configuration security and data privacy protection.},

 abstract = {Web3 social media strives to eliminate the need for centralized management by building upon on technologies such public ledgers and smart contracts. This has generated significant hype, but creates many notable challenges, many of which remain unaddressed. One such challenge is content moderation. Specifically, the immutable nature of blockchain means that it becomes impossible to retrospectively delete posts. This means that illegal content posts cannot be moderated or removed. In an attempt to overcome this, Web3 platforms, such as memo.cash, allow users to filter out posts from their personal timelines. Taking memo.cash as a use case, the goal of this work is to study the efficacy of the approach, and identify associated challenges. A particularly unique feature of memo.cash is that users must pay money (satoshi) for each social action (e.g., posting and blocking other users). We conjecture that this may impact the nature of moderation, particularly among poorer users. To explore this, we gather data from memo.cash covering 24K&nbsp;users, 317K&nbsp;posts, and 2.57M user actions. We investigate how the need to pay may impact the moderation system and propose potential solutions to address the challenges that arise.},

Further, we have formulated charging scenarios based on the energy demand and type of EV (emergency and high authority). We have deployed the smart contract in Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and further built a decentralized application using Web3 to made charging allocation accessible to the EVs. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed smart contract for the application is evaluated in terms of gas consumption and cost analysis with the help of deployed smart contract in the Remix IDE.},

If such high-risk SNS accounts hold large amounts of crypto-assets, they are subject to account hijacking and spoofing attacks for financial gain. In this study, we proposed a method to discover highly relevant SNS accounts from a seed account on Web2 and Web3 SNSs and estimate their account ownership. We applied our method to 480 seed accounts of 9 different SNSs and discovered 1,233 new accounts. We found that SNSs with multiple URL input forms on their profile setting pages linked more accounts and revealed that 207 out of 253 (81.8\%) users reused their IDs across different SNSs. We identified 26 accounts linked to personal and crypto-asset information that are at risk of de-anonymization. Our user study using crowdsourcing services showed that as many as 232 (40.8\%) out of 568 respondents do not understand the traceability of blockchain transaction histories. We examined the security and privacy risks caused by account listing and ID reuse, and made recommendations for service providers and users based on our findings.},

Most existing FaaS systems are centralized, i.e., the infrastructure is owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. This character brings a few limitations. For instance, an end user will be bound with a specific cloud service provider and there is a risk of single point of failure. In order to mitigate these limitations, a natural idea is to build a decentralized FaaS system. In this paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system that uses blockchain technology and decentralized API management to build a decentralized FaaS system, which enables greater scalability, flexibility, improved security, and reliability. Specifically, DeFaaS uses a blockchain to create a decentralized registry of available functions (services) and manage their execution. An application interacts with the blockchain to discover and invoke functions securely and transparently. In addition to providing a reliable and scalable platform for decentralized FaaS, DeFaaS can support other distributed computing scenarios, such as dApps, volunteer computing, and multi-cloud service mesh. Overall, our proposed system represents a significant advance in the field of decentralized computing and has the potential to enable a wide range of exciting new applications and use cases.},

While password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) are widely used to solve this problem in centralized applications, their low entropy and lack of a recovery mechanism make them unsuitable for use in decentralized contexts. The multi-factor key derivation function (MFKDF) is a recently proposed cryptographic primitive that aims to address these deficiencies by incorporating commonly used authentication factors into the key derivation process. In this paper, we implement an MFKDF-based Ethereum wallet and perform a user study with 27 participants to directly compare its usability against traditional cryptocurrency wallet architectures. Our results show that MFKDF-based applications outperform conventional key management approaches on both subjective and objective metrics, with a 37\% higher average SUS score (p &lt; 0.0001) and 71\% faster task completion times (p &lt; 0.0001) for the MFKDF-based wallet.},

 abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts enable a wide range of use cases by relying on trustless and guaranteed code execution. The immutability of blockchains means that defects in smart contracts cannot be fixed once the code has been deployed. Previous research has focused on identifying defects and developing tools to improve defect detection. However, several existing blockchain defect datasets rely solely on expert knowledge or static code analysis. They do not provide an objective assessment of the real-world impact of defects. We show how blockchain transactions and execution traces can support an objective evaluation of the impact of a smart contract defect. As a foundation for future research, we propose three novel blockchain-specific metrics. Using the defect dataset SmartBugs, we demonstrate the computation of the metrics and the use cases that can benefit from them. This example focuses on five distinct types of the commonly occurring reentrancy vulnerability defect as detected by Slither, Manticore and Osiris.},

 abstract = {Ethereum has established itself as a highly decentralized and reliable blockchain network and serves as the de facto standard. However, using public blockchains in enterprise applications can be challenging due to concerns about confidentiality and transaction finality. As a result, consortium and private blockchains, which limit participation to specific nodes, are also commonly used. But these consortium blockchains also have limitations, such as limited node participation due to performance constraints imposed by the consensus algorithm. In this study, by using ZK-rollups as a messaging means, we would connect consortium blockchains via public Ethereum as a hub. We examined a mechanism to balance both mathematically reliable interoperability and maintaining the secrecy of the information and the finality. The concept was actually implemented, to confirm the interoperability of simple money transfer transactions. And also, the way to handle secret information and the finality was theoretically organized.},

The integration of IoT with the blockchain technology is one of the most promising solutions to achieve the previously mentioned features in the IoT networks.

 abstract = {Decentralized and distributed blockchain technology has superior potential. Quorum, as a permissioned blockchain platform, provides enhanced privacy and performance that are suitable for enterprise needs. Cloud, as the infrastructure for Quorum-based blockchain, is vulnerable to failures. Failures originating from errors need to be tolerated through improved reliability and fault-tolerance procedures. Fault-tolerance and reliability are still challenging to implement in cloud infrastructure for Quorum-based blockchain networks. This research focuses on implementing fault-tolerance mechanisms in the provisioning of Quorum-based blockchain in a cloud environment. The research explores the use of hybrid fault tolerance by adopting a combination of reactive protocol, namely replication, and proactive protocol, namely monitoring. The replication protocol creates data redundancy with reactive treatment performed in case of failures, ensuring data availability even in failure conditions. The monitoring protocol provides real-time monitoring of the blockchain network's condition and performance, enabling proactive detection and mitigation of system failures. Overall, this research utilizes automation in its operational processes. It employs tools such as Amazon Web Services, Quorum, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and Truffle. The research design and implementation are divided into cloud infrastructure, blockchain network, and interface. The research testing results demonstrate that the system infrastructure is capable of achieving fault tolerance using replication and monitoring protocols, as well as making transactions within the blockchain network.},

@article{10.1145/3626963,
 abstract = {Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability issue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of the chain of blocks (and of the transactions within each block). However, total order is often not fully necessary, since important advanced applications of smart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much higher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order (instead of a total order) can be exploited. In this article, we propose a novel distributed concurrent data type, Setchain, which significantly improves scalability. A Setchain implements a grow-only set whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional blockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest elements added, agreed by consensus. Therefore, two operations in the same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are ordered by their respective epoch number. We present different Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness, and report on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results show that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers, since it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total order. Since the Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying blockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many decentralized solutions with much faster operations than direct implementations on top of blockchains. Finally, we also present an algorithm that encompasses into a single process the combined behavior of the Byzantine servers, which simplifies correctness proofs by encoding the general attacker in a concrete implementation.},

However, issuing credentials with blockchain could conflict with current management rules and policies. One of the possible conflicts is the auditability. Most blockchain-based systems for credentials focus on security, efficiency and privacy while ignoring the auditability of the system. In this paper, we propose a new system IU-TransCert for issuing, verifying, and auditing academic credentials. The system uses a new data structure named the Auditable Merkle Tree that enables credential issuance and built-in auditing capabilities. The auditable data fields can be customized to meet regulations. Credentials are published to the blockchain in the root node of the Auditable Merkle Tree, allowing access for auditors while preserving privacy. The system provides automated and transparent auditing processes for educational authorities to independently verify credentials without involving issuers. We also present a prototype to demonstrate feasibility, and a security analysis to examine protections against threats. The analysis and discussion shows that the proposed system could enhance credential privacy, efficiency, integrity, and auditability across the university ecosystem.},

Papyrology, specifically, relies on meticulous study and reconstruction of fragmented texts by experts. Current digital platforms for editing and publishing papyrological texts lack the ability to manage the complex components of critical editions while facilitating peer review. In our work we propose a novel framework utilizing blockchain and smart contracts to automate the storage and retrieval of multiple related editions of a text while ensuring contributions by multiple authors are recorded. The system architecture consists of a user interface for submitting editions, a smart contract that manages storage, the blockchain ledger which stores data locations, and the use of the decentralized storage platform, the Interplanetary Files System (IPFS). Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the framework by storing 501 synthetic editions on IPFS and recording metrics for encoding, transmission time, blockchain transaction time, and transaction costs. We believe this novel framework could enable the advancement of digital papyrology through distributed peer review and allow for the integration of AI agents into papyrology.

 abstract = {The anonymity, multi-show unlinkability, and selective disclosure property of anonymous credentials enables users to access third-party services without revealing unnecessary details or being profiled. Threshold-based anonymous credentials provide a distributed framework to issue these credentials. While all of this enhances privacy, anonymity can also be misused and some schemes, therefore, have an opening mechanism, which enables the authorities to trace a user's identity. Nevertheless, relying solely on this measure is inadequate as the users can continue to use their previously issued anonymous credentials to authenticate themselves successfully with the service providers. To address this issue, we propose a revocation mechanism for such schemes using dynamic threshold accumulators (DTA) (Helminger et al. 2021). We first formally define a generic threshold-based anonymous credentials with an opening scheme (TACO) and subsequently propose an extension of TACO, "Revocable TACO (RTACO)" - revocable threshold-based credentials over blockchains - that integrates a revocation mechanism based on DTAs to the TACO system. In RTACO, we integrate a revocation handle into the credential as an extra attribute, allowing the disclosure of this attribute during the opening phase, which is then used to blocklist the credential, preventing its further use. We formally prove the security of this scheme in the universal composability (UC) framework. We also give a proof-of-concept implementation of RTACO over the Ethereum blockchain.},

 abstract = {The cultivation of professionals and the fostering of awareness and literacy surrounding blockchain technology are indispensable because of its unprecedented impact on daily lives. However, the existing blockchain Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) approaches for secondary students are inadequate. In this study, we designed a tailored workshop for secondary students and examined the effectiveness of introducing blockchain concepts in the context of metaverse by implementation. The workshop integrated four educational theories, including Transfer of Learning, Interest Theory, Situated Learning, and Experiential Learning. The synthesis of typical theories gives rise to an innovative education strategy aimed at facilitating a transfer of awareness and interest from the metaverse domain to the blockchain domain, which is also the workshop’s ultimate goal. The workshop was designed considering the developmental status of secondary school students and its alignment with the Hong Kong secondary curriculum framework to accomplish the learning objective of enhancing their knowledge, skill, awareness and interest in blockchain technology. 225 secondary students joined the workshop, and the findings demonstrated that our approach is effective and the adoption of the transfer from the metaverse domain to the blockchain domain is feasible. The results of this paper may serve as a successful example of blockchain education for secondary students.},

 abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are decentralized digital tokens to represent the unique ownership of items. Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

 abstract = {Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a carrier of unique identity as a virtual currency. Its indivisible, unique, and verifiable characteristics can truly reflect personal assets and virtual assets to a certain extent. It is widely applied by users in art, games, collectibles and other areas. NFT is stored on the blockchain. The user's digital signature is embedded into the NFT record, which is distributed through a smart contract and verified by the blockchain consensus mechanism, thus solving the problem of identity confirmation in digital asset transactions. This paper makes a review of the main processes and key technologies in NFT applications. First, it introduces the life of NFT: minting, distribution, storage and circulation. Then, the key technologies of NFT are explained, including the blockchain smart contracts and consensus mechanisms in NFT distribution and transaction, the token standards that the minting and transaction process of NFT needs to use, and the important role of NFT in the field of web3. Finally, through the evaluation system of NFT, the problems existing in the current NFT applications and the future research direction are drawn out.},

 abstract = {Decentralized blockchain-based social media (BSM) applications require different moderation strategies that suit the business models. Conventional social media uses centralized universal moderation strategies, which are human-extensive and time-consuming. Apart from that shortcomings, the absence of centralized authorities pushes the need for effective and efficient decentralized moderation strategies. This study proposed a novel community-driven moderation technique for decentralized blockchain-based social media. The proposed technique manage and review user-generated content (UGC) and activity directly at the moment of action. Performance evaluation of the proposed technique is crucial for feasible implementation in blockchain-based social media applications. The community-driven moderation technique on speed, cost, and user satisfaction is tested on the Polygon blockchain. The results indicate the cost of between 51,112 and 719,999 gas units. The average response time is 5.083 seconds, and the average gas fee is 4.2E-8 Matic. End User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) Questionnaires on the proposed technique achieved high satisfaction scores for content and accuracy and low satisfaction scores for ease of use.},

 abstract = {User migration, i.e. the movement of large sets of users from one online social platform to another one, is one of the main phenomena occurring in modern online social networks and even involves the most recent alternative paradigms of online social networks, such as blockchain online social networks (BOSNs). In these platforms, user migration mainly occurs through hard forks of the supporting blockchain, i.e. a split of the original blockchain and the creation of an alternative blockchain, to which users may decide to migrate. However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

 abstract = {Traditional medical prescriptions based on physical paper-based documents are prone to manipulation, errors, and unauthorized reproduction due to their format. Addressing the limitations of the traditional prescription system, e-prescription systems have been introduced in several countries. However, e-prescription systems lead to several concerns like the risk of privacy loss, the problem of double-spending prescriptions, lack of interoperability, and single point of failure, all of which need to be addressed immediately. We propose an AI-assisted blockchain-enabled smart and secure e-prescription management framework to address these issues. Our proposed system overcomes the problems of the centralized e-prescription systems and enables efficient consent management to access prescriptions by incorporating blockchain-based smart contracts. Our work incorporates the Umbral proxy re-encryption scheme in the proposed system, avoiding the need for repeated encryption and decryption of the prescriptions when transferred between different entities in the network. In our work, we employ two different machine learning models(Random Forest classifier and LightGBM classifier) to assist the doctor in prescribing medicines. One is a drug recommendation model, which is aimed at providing drug recommendations considering the medical history of the patients and the general prescription pattern for the particular ailment of the patient. We have fine-tuned the SciBERT model for adverse drug reaction detection. The extensive experimentation and results show that the proposed e-prescription framework is secure, scalable, and interoperable. Further, the proposed machine learning models produce results higher than 95\%.},

Local governments at all levels, enterprises and institutions actively respond to the national policy of targeted poverty alleviation (TPA), through precise counterpart support, promotion and sales of agricultural products, to achieve the purpose of helping farmers in remote areas to get rid of poverty. In order to further tap the poverty alleviation potential of the whole society and accelerate the goal of poverty alleviation, this paper proposes and designs a Consumer to Farmer (C2F) platform, based on "decentralized" blockchain technology, to build a direct link between consumers and farmers. By adopting the form of multi-nodes to build a federation chain, and at the same time combining smart contract technology to design and develop a decentralizedblockchain-based TPA platform. Through the roadmap of consumers purchasing and paying in advance for agricultural products, farmers produce and deliver the ordered agricultural products, achieving a win-win outcome for both consumers and farmers. The C2F platform is therefore of great relevance as a complement to government-led TPA.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized access control framework with transitive delegation capabilities that tackles the performance and scalability limitations of the existing state-of-the-art solutions. In order to accomplish this, the proposed solution is anchored in the self-sovereign identity (SSI) paradigm, which embodies a distributed identity management system. By adopting this paradigm, we obviate slow cryptographic premises such as identity-based encryption (IBE) that were used in prior work. Furthermore, we enhance the existing verifiable credentials (VCs) from this paradigm by introducing our own decentralized permission objects to support the concept of transitive delegations. This concept allows delegates to further delegate their access to resources with the same or fewer privileges to other entities within the framework. This renders our solution suitable for diverse scenarios, including applications in decentralized building access management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of transitive delegations in this paradigm. Finally, our performance experiments show a performance enhancement of three orders of magnitude compared to the prevailing state-of-the-art solutions.},

Our proposed distributed VRF scheme employs multi-party computation (MPC) where each participant is identified by their own decentralized identifiers (DID) on a blockchain network, making the collective randomness by preventing any single participant from determining the output of the VRF. We further aim to enhance the randomness of our VRF scheme by utilizing a successor rule-based de Bruijn sequence to generate pseudo-random numbers with a strong balanced property, ensuring both numbers of 1s and 0s are equal. For generic VRF construction, we adapt the approach of selective-secure VRF scheme using verifiable functional encryption (VFE), which is a more generalized version of homomorphic encryption plus verifiability. Moreover, we estimate the security aspects of our VRF scheme and the entropy approximation based on the information-theoretic perfect secrecy model. Also, using the NIST SP800-22 test suite for randomness, we demonstrate the randomness performance with a 98.29\% overall pass rate on the total 176 tests of 11 standard tests and 0.6765 of the average p -value for statistical randomness.

 abstract = {Since the emergence of bitcoin, 14 years ago, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins these virtual currencies have experienced a rapid growth, with a plethora of applications emerging. While most popular applications of blockchain technology are in the business field, its main features – such as decentralization or enhanced security – make it suitable to redesign social, cultural and political realities such as the social contract that regulates the relationship between states and citizens. Blockchain-based applications have the potential to change social values and the social contract itself. This paper aims to discover if smart contracts and blockchain technology can bind the social contract between the state and its citizens in such a way as to reduce corruption and increase efficiency of service delivery. Further, the emergence of a new type of social contract will be investigated: the smart social contract. This new concept aspires to enhance Jean Jacques Rousseau's social contract with the benefits inherent in blockchain technology. It involves an automatic execution of the obligations that a government assumes through a certain program, determined by consensus by all the members of society. In case of non-fulfillment of the obligations, the persons /institutions responsible are sanctioned appropriate penalties. We implement and evaluate a prototype of a smart social contract in Solidity, finding that the contract is capable of automatic execution upon the achievement of predetermined conditions, such as the fulfillment of an obligation by a local government official.},

@article{10.1145/3664287,
 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a complex network comprising interconnected devices that transmit their data via the Internet. Due to their open environment, limited computation power, and absence of built-in security, IoT environments are susceptible to various cyberattacks. Denial of service (DDoS) attacks are among the most destructive types of threats. The Multi-vector DDoS attack is a contemporary and formidable form of DDoS wherein the attacker employs a collection of compromised IoT devices as zombies to initiate numerous DDoS attacks against a target server. A Blockchain-based Operational Threat Intelligence framework, OTI-IoT, is proposed in this article to counter multi-vector DDoS attacks in IoT networks. A “Prevent-then-Detect” methodology was utilized to deploy the OTI-IoT framework in two distinct stages. During Phase 1, the consortium Blockchain network validators employ the IPS module, composed of a smart contract for attack prevention and access control, and Proof of Voting consensus, to thwart attacks. Validators are outfitted with deep learning-based IDS instances to detect multi-vector DDoS attacks during Phase 2. Alert messages are generated by the IDS module’s alert generation and propagation smart contract in response to identifying malicious IoT sources. The feedback loop from the IDS module to the IPS module prevents incoming traffic from malicious sources. The proposed OTI framework capabilities are realized as an outcome of combining and storing the outcomes of the IDS and IPS modules on the consortium Blockchain. Each validator maintains a shared ledger containing information regarding threat sources to ensure robust security, transparency, and integrity. The operational execution of OTI-IoT occurs on an individual Ethereum Blockchain. The empirical findings indicate that our proposed framework is most suitable for real-time applications due to its ability to lower attack detection time, decreased block validation time, and higher attack prevention rate.},

 abstract = {With the growth of the Web3 domain, there has been a significant rise of third-party software packages. These range from basic blockchain interaction tools and contract development aids to front-end development packages for Decentralized Applications (DApps), with the diversity and inter-dependencies of these packages continuing to grow. However, despite these advancements, the security of these packages has not kept pace, highlighted by several significant Web3 supply chain attacks. It underscored the urgent need for a deeper understanding of the Web3 third-party library supply chain. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the Web3 third-party package supply chain using knowledge graphs, which detail the structure, themes, and evolving dynamics within this domain. Further, we analyze the characteristics of vulnerabilities and their propagation through knowledge graphs in the Web3 ecosystem. We also extend our findings to practical applications, providing valuable insights for Web3 community stakeholders and creating an extensive dataset that includes 695,642 versions of Web3 packages and 270,217,326 dependency links. This research is aimed at reinforcing the foundation of Web3 development, promoting enhanced security practices, and supporting informed decision-making within the DApp landscape.},

 abstract = {The ability to decentralize knowledge graphs (KG) is important to exploit the full potential of the Semantic Web and realize the Web 3.0 vision. However, decentralization also renders KGs more prone to attacks with adverse effects on data integrity and query verifiability. While existing studies focus on ensuring data integrity, how to ensure query verifiability - thus guarding against incorrect, incomplete, or outdated query results - remains unsolved. We propose VeriDKG, the first SPARQL query engine for decentralized knowledge graphs (DKG) that offers both data integrity and query verifiability guarantees. The core of VeriDKG is the RGB-Trie, a new blockchain-maintained authenticated data structure (ADS) facilitating correctness proofs for SPARQL query results. VeriDKG enables verifiability of subqueries by gathering global index information on subgraphs using the RGB-Trie, which is implemented as a new variant of the Merkle prefix tree with an RGB color model. To enable verifiability of the final query result, the RGB-Trie is integrated with a cryptographic accumulator to support verifiable aggregation operations. A rigorous analysis of query verifiability in VeriDKG is presented, along with evidence from an extensive experimental study demonstrating its state-of-the-art query performance on the largeRDFbench benchmark.},

A core challenge for such systems is model training and pipeline monitoring/management while not revealing sensitive data or introducing new attack points. Innovative solutions that reveal network structure and topology are often in conflict with security/privacy design principles. In this paper, we consider the system communication between sensors, edge, and the cloud that does not reveal the origin source or destination of the data. A core contribution is how to apply Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to decentralized architectures that are not under the direct control of a service provider. The aim is to decouple the Machine Learning (ML) solution, data platform, and sensors while avoiding service level degradation. We utilize an unlinkable end-to-end encrypted asynchronous communication protocol called Whisper that is based on the Ethereum blockchain to achieve sender and receiver anonymity. The Whisper protocol provides a level of darkness that maintains anonymity in communication.},

In this paper, we propose a Self-Sovereign Identity-based, Decentralized, and Dynamic (SSIDD) access control system. SSIDD utilizes blockchain technologies to build trust for untrusted data sharing networks and ensures user privacy. Our access control provides high access policy flexibility and security for global inter-enterprise collaborations from a diverse industrial environment. SSIDD authenticates its users based on their Decentralized Identifiers (DID), which are under control of users and can be resolved into a DID document stored on the blockchain. Our data management technology keeps the data sharing systems safe against issues such as data breaches, identity thefts, and privacy violations. Besides, the authorization process of SSIDD is dynamic by adopting several smart contracts. The transparency of rules and agreements in smart contracts and the traceability of records on blockchain ledger provide a high level of security and trust. For proof of concept, we have developed and evaluated a prototype of SSIDD. Our evaluations show that the throughput and latency of our method are within an acceptable range.},

Researchers from different fields such as network science, computational social science and data mining, might benefit from these large collections of temporal and heterogeneous data capturing different kinds of interaction among people and between people and the platforms. In this study we focus on a specific issue related to these modern techno-social systems, i.e. the understanding of the rules driving their growth. To reach this goal, we performed an analysis based on graph evolution rules - GERs - on different networks gathered from Web3 platforms such as Steemit or OpenSea. Graph evolution rules mining is a frequency-based method for evaluating network evolution which does not require any prior growth process for disentangling how networks evolve. By comparing the evolution rules of social network platforms and asset trading services through GER profiles, we observe that some evolution rules are common to all Web3 platforms, regardless of the system specificity. On the other hand, in specific cases, the frequency of graph evolution rules is influenced by the nature of the platform: whereas social and token-transfer networks are characterized by rules which increase network transitivity and reciprocity, NFT trading networks, especially those specialized in a specific type of digital asset, are driven by rules which form trading chains. These findings suggest that the GER approach and the GER profiles are a good starting point to get insights into the evolutionary behavior of a network and to define a classification of graph evolution rules.},

 abstract = {This article proposes a novel parallel management mode based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for enterprises by utilizing the artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution (ACP) approach, parallel intelligence theory, and blockchain technologies, to realize the distributed management of an enterprise. The artificial enterprise DAO (EnDAO) corresponding to the actual enterprise is constructed, and they constitute a parallel system via virtual–real interaction and parallel execution. Through the non-fungible token (NFT)-based incentive mechanism, metaverse-based virtual learning and training, as well as DAO-based distributed management and decision-making, the management and control of the actual enterprise as well as its employees can be carried out. By virtue of the virtual–real interactions of three types of employees, as well as the virtual–real feedback of three closed loops in the parallel systems, DAO-based parallel management for enterprises can realize descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence. On this basis, this article takes the recruitment-oriented key performance indicator (KPI) management of a startup technology enterprise as the case to introduce the operation processes and illustrate the superiorities of the proposed DAO-based enterprise parallel management mode.},

 abstract = {In order to reduce limitations and as a practical substitute for voting on paper, electronic voting has developed gradually as a feasible alternative. The last decade's worth of related studies implies that, building a secure e-voting system using web 2.0 technology that assures the integrity of the votes while also giving transparency has been a long-standing difficulty. In a network of centralized systems, a single party has the right to administer data sources. Since the centralized voting systems are more vulnerable to data manipulation issues, the trust has faded in the voters on behalf of the entire process. In this paper authors discuss the solution with blockchain which is secured. The proposed implementation is ideal for small or medium-scale elections, and this includes several basic components of our methodology in three fictitious modules: the administrative module, the Voters module, and the Blockchain module. Node JS, Ganache, and Web3 JS are used as the main technologies. In conclusion, it is expected to implement a secure system for conducting web-based digital voting that ensures the integrity of the votes registered. Furthermore, it intends to enhance the system in the future to accommodate large-scale elections with a viable solution to the blockchain trilemma issues.},

It’s vital to communicate these data in a secure and safe manner. To overcome this problem, the proposed solution named, CoreMedi, uses blockchain technology to store and share medical data. Data stored on blockchain is immutable, verifiable and transparent (based on accessibility). As data cannot be altered on blockchain, the rate of fraud may be drastically decreased. With the help of smart contracts which are small pieces of code that run on blockchain, a Decentralized Application (DApps) is designed and implemented that enables patients/individuals to store and share medical records securely. Users may share their medical history, medications, and personal data with a specific medical personnel on the same blockchain network using CoreMedi, a Decentralized Web application. The application is implemented with React as frontend and the backend infrastructure uses Ethereum solidity smart contracts. The process of running a blockchain application is not simple because the users must be willing to spend crytpocurrencies as gas fees, as this is the way to maintain the network with no single organization having control.},

With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.},

 abstract = {Git has been the de-facto version control system for the Software Development industry. Although Git is distributed, developers’ tools for collaboration, such as GitHub, are centralized entities owned by large corporations such as Microsoft. The centralization creates trust and privacy issues for software development companies (preserving their intellectual property), along with a significant" single point of failure" issue. In addition, such centralized systems are susceptible to Sybil and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks due to the presence of malicious individuals. Blockchain technology has many key characteristics (such as decentralization, transparency, immutability, and audibility), solving these centralization issues. However, the requirement of having a storage system to store the user’s repositories over the blockchain creates a scalability issue (in terms of storage). Most importantly, it makes data (code) privacy more severe due to its open nature. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized alternative solution and framework named "DCGit" powered by Web3 technologies such as the Ethereum Blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to provide security and scalability yet user-friendly collaboration for software development.},

 abstract = {The world of web3 is currently being plagued by security risks. In the first half of 2022 alone, web3 projects have lost more than $2 billion due to various security issues, out of which more than 76% of the projects have been audited. At present, the main attack surfaces on the web3 chain, including oracle manipulation, logical loopholes across smart contracts and MEV front-running transactions, cannot be defended through the current mainstream security methods, such as contract auditing, and can only be passively defended after receiving the alerts of malicious attacks. Hence, there is a huge demand for more proactive defense products in the market. However, most of the existing security products and security defense solutions are limited in defense capabilities, as they rely on external mechanisms and thus cannot effectively identify and counter hacker attacks during the contract execution. This paper proposes a new security system for smart contracts on the blockchain and demonstrates how it can actively defend against malicious attacks and provide effective protection for assets on the blockchain through experimental verification and comparison. It compares the existing on-chain security verification solutions as well as the engineering development model and performs logic-based argument verification during on-chain transaction execution and high-precision computation-intensive verification in the off-chain sandbox environment, thereby can prevent risky transactions, protect assets, and promote the security and development of the entire web3.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, demand for rental vehicle sharing is increasing. People are preferring to rent vehicles instead of putting a lot of money in a new vehicle. This renting system is beneficial for not only the consumer but also to the owner of the vehicle. Many issues such as theft, use of vehicle, bad condition of vehicles are not considered in the conventional rental systems. With the help of blockchain and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), these issues are resolved in this system. Blockchain has many advantages due to its peer to peer sharing network. Smart contracts in Blockchain technology are contracts that run on their own in which context for the buyer-seller consensus are inscribed directly into the code. This system proposes a smart vehicle rental system which works with Blockchain, CPS and Internet of Things (IoT). The system utilizes IoT sensors to collect automatic data about car usage in real-time. For transactions of both customer and owner, these data make car availability and usage more authentic and credible. The implementation of this system uses Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.JS, Distributed Applications (dApp), Truffle. The proposed rental vehicle system with blockchain provides better reliability, traceability and security to both the owner as well as consumer.},

 abstract = {Web3 represents an evolution of the centralized and siloed topology of Web2 by focusing on more connected, decentralized, and open technology to democratize data and services between databases, tools, devices, people, teams and organizations to provide secure single sources of truth on decentralized trust lay-ers. However, sensitive data, such as intellectual property, classified information, personal data, or medical records, cannot be distributed to those without explicit access. A standard solution is to encrypt the data before uploading and then distribute the decryption key to select persons. This solution does not sufficiently protect against data leakage. In addition, legal, contractual, and GDPR requirements are not met in current Web3 systems. This study suggests critical requirements for any Web3 system that targets sensitive data, private and permissioned needs, and enterprise and governmental applications. A preliminary framework is then introduced for building compliant Web3 systems to the suggested requirements. The study proposes changes to the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) protocol, with the main change being that each request checks against a ledger if the requestor has access to the data. Two novel Ethereum smart contracts, Enterprise Architecture and Smart Legal Contract, are presented to meet the suggested requirements.},

 abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry's crucial task is to look after the medicines while they are being transported, by ensuring ideal storage conditions and keeping track of the complete medications sent to prevent risky scenarios. These three classifications are used by WHO: falsified, substandard, and unregistered/unlicensed. The need for sophisticated tools to identify fabricated pharmaceuticals will rise as criminals grow craftier. To identify phoney and substandard drugs, new technologies are continually being developed. A substantial lack of transparency in the current system makes it difficult for patients to understand the cost of acquired medications, making counterfeit drugs a prime issue. Moreover, if there are accusations of illegal or unethical behaviours, it could be difficult to look into supply chain tampering. The blockchain technology was employed. Two parties' transactions can be efficiently and permanently recorded using an open, distributed ledger like blockchain. Blockchains are transparent, decentralized, distributed, and unchangeable, which makes them an ideal solution for the problem of fake medications. This study proposes a mechanism for the safe distribution of medications throughout the whole supply chain. Each product in the chain can be moved between chain associates who have been confirmed using an event request-response approach. A product may be traced back to its source thanks to smart contracts, which are used to record all transactions between entities onto the blockchain. A DApp is made using the React Framework. On a local blockchain that Ganache provided, the smart contracts were put into action. The blockchain connection between the DApp and Web3.js is made possible by the Truffle framework. The outcomes of the studies show that our method is practical and marginally more secure than existing solutions.},

Web 1.0 focused on serving static pages is considered as the read-only web, whereas web 2.0 made way for dynamic pages making it as read-write web, which is predominantly experienced. The main problem face here is, as the users of E-commerce applications, is single-point-of-failure (SPOF), which means, the data stored in centralized servers is highly susceptible and vulnerable to attacks. Now, the internet's next evolution enables to develop decentralized applications and adds few other features like trustlessness, distributed, transparent, robust, etc. This also makes web 3.0 as read-write-own web. Now, this evolution wave of decentralization has hit the applications. To overcome this problem, this study has proposed a solution to completely decentralize the E-Commerce platform by using Blockchain in conjunction with smart contracts and utilizes the decentralized storage like IPFS (Inter Planetary File System).

Modern centralised digital marketplaces and enterprises provide consumers with an alternative method of selling and purchasing items conveniently. However, disadvantages among the marketplaces include the platform’s potential to arbitrarily block merchants, the fees associated with listing and selling products on the site, and the lack of user data privacy. In this, we propose and demonstrate a decentralised application that takes advantage of the Ethereum blockchain to address all these issues. The Truffle development framework was employed in the creation of the application. An Ethereum smart contract later migrated to the Ethereum network comprised the application’s features. The web3.js API (Application Program Interface) was used to send the user’s input to the Ethereum network after being received through a web interface. The users involved will be able to do transactions with the help of an interactive user interface. The interfacing is done using the Truffle framework, and the transactions are made through MetaMask, where ETH tokens are used. The dApp is created using JavaScript and React JS library. Thus, the integration of the blockchain and with front-end application by interfacing it with web 3.0 helps create a secured, immutable, trusted, and easy-to-use e-commerce website.},

 abstract = {In recent years, Blockchain-based Online Social Media (BOSM) platforms have evolved fast due to the advancement of blockchain technology. BOSM can effectively overcome the problems of traditional social media platforms, such as a single point of trust and insufficient incentives for users, by combining a decentralized governance structure and a cryptocurrency-based incentive model, thereby attracting a large number of users and making it a crucial component of Web3. BOSM allows users to downvote low-quality content and aims to decrease the visibility of low-quality content by sorting and filtering it through downvoting. However, this feature may be maliciously exploited by some users to undermine the fairness of the incentive, reduce the quality of highly visible content, and further reduce users’ enthusiasm for content creation and the attractiveness of the platform. In this paper, we study and analyze the downvoting behavior using four years of data collected from Steemit, the largest BOSM platform. We discovered that a significant number of bot accounts were actively downvoting content. In addition, we discovered that roughly 9% of the downvoting activity might be retaliatory. We did not detect any significant instances of downvoting on content for a specific topic. We believe that the findings in this paper will facilitate the future development of user behavior analysis and incentive pattern design in BOSM and Web3.},

The key feature of the Web3 metaverse is that the ownership of digital assets is recorded by non-fungible token (NFT) protocol on the blockchain. Thus, users are better encouraged to construct Web3 metaverse due to the ownership of their user-generated content (UGC). However, the existing UGC editors mainly face two challenges: they cannot guarantee the uniqueness of UGC; and they are hard-pressed to find a trade-off between model granularity and 3D modeling difficulty. In this article, we design a novel UGC editor for the Web3 metaverse, named MetaCube, to address these challenges. MetaCube applies an artificial intelligence (AI) method to assist the UGC creation for decreasing the 3D modeling difficulty while maintaining the model granularity. To guarantee the uniqueness of UGC, this article proposes 3D Crypto-dropout, a specially designed dropout that can utilize user information to control the UGC creation process and generate unique fine-grained 3D models. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3D Crypto-dropout can effectively guarantee the uniqueness of UGC from both numerical and human-centered evaluation. Moreover, the existing challenges and open research topics for the uniqueness of UGC are also profoundly discussed.},

Recently, to provide intelligent service for Web3 users, artificial intelligence applications have been booming, thus generating enormous deep learning models. These models are supposed to be deployed in the edge due to their massive computation. Further-more, edge servers may face overload and intolerable delay for the high concurrency of offloaded deep learning tasks. How to determine an optimal offloading decision in the highly dynamic and heterogeneous edge-cloud environment is still a challenge. To tackle the mentioned challenge, a dynamic offloading strategy based on game theory combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) partition for vehicular edge networks, named GPOV, is proposed. Specifically, CNN partition can utilize resources more efficiently and reduce the delay with parallelism. The game theoretic offloading decision strategy can determine the optimal offloading policy according to the real-time environment. The performance of our strategy is validated in the final part of this article.},

In this paper, we make use of the referable NFT (rNFT11In this work, rNFT mainly refers to the EIP-5521 protocol and corresponding formed network/topology [1], while NFT is used in the context of a single node, node sets, or products that align with the EIP-5521 protocol.) standard [2], indexed EIP-5521, to construct an rNFT classification framework leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN), an emerging branch of Deep Learning (DL), which learns on the inherent topology of graph-based data. In particular, we first transform the rNFT backward and onward reference relationship to a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and model appropriate node and edge features from rNFT metadata and associated token transactions. Next, a multi-layer GraphSage model is designed to include the collected features for the learning process. In this way, the model takes into account graph topology together with features to classify both the existing and incoming NFT nodes in a supervised way. We also give comprehensive elaboration on the architecture of the new GNN-based recommender system with discussions in regard to its characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, we expect to conduct extensive experiments, by presenting an initial plan, to show the feasibility and efficacy of our system.},

All the existing F aaS systems are owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. While this is not an issue for most existing enterprise applications, such character is not compatible with the decentralization principle of dApp/Web3 applications, more of which are being deployed in the cloud environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a decentralized FaaS, which is managed by multiple cloud service providers and allows a decentralized application to take advantages of FaaS. In this research paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system for managing decentralized FaaS using blockchain technology and decentralized API management, where functions are executed on a distributed network of nodes by multi-cloud data centers, rather than on a centralized server. This allows for greater scalability and flexibility, as well as improved security and reliability.},

 abstract = {Decentralization promises to remedy the drawbacks of the web by executing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchains. Unfortunately, modern blockchains cannot support realistic web application workloads mainly due to congestion.We introduce the Smart Redbelly Blockchain (SRBB), a provably correct permissionless blockchain that reduces congestion by (1) avoiding redundant propagation and validations of transactions with Transaction Validation and Propagation Reduction (TVPR) and (2) mitigating the propagation of invalid transactions within blocks by Byzantine nodes with a dedicated Reward-Penalty Mechanism (RPM). Our comparison of SRBB against Algorand, Avalanche, Diem, Ethereum, Quorum, and Solana, using the DIABLO benchmark suite, indicates that SRBB outperforms all these blockchains under real application workloads. Moreover, SRBB is the only blockchain to successfully execute real workloads of NASDAQ and Uber on a DApp without losing transactions. To demonstrate that TVPR and RPM are the causes of the improved performance, we compare SRBB with its naive baseline, which does not contain TVPR and RPM. Our results show that TVPR increases the throughput by 55× and divides the latency by 3.5, while RPM increases the throughput by 7% under flooding attacks. Finally, TVPR helps reduce transaction losses in the normal scenario while RPM goes further and mitigates transaction losses under flooding attacks.},

In particular, transparency and traceability can significantly get improved by a blockchain based data exchange platform which provides an immutable source of truth driven by a multi-stakeholder consensus. This also helps authenticate the provenance of products which is an added value that can be monetized by the supply chain participants. Nonetheless, due to the transparent nature of the blockchain, privacy and confidentiality are still a major concern for industries. In this paper, we present zk-BeSC, a blockchain enabled supply chain scheme based on zero-knowledge proofs of polynomials. The scheme allows transactions between supply chain participants in a privacy preserving fashion. It also offers tamper-resistance and replication due to the intrinsic nature of the blockchain. ZK-BeSC is fully implemented using an ethereum testnet and a web3 application. The scheme performs efficient proofs and has reduced gas consumption during verification.},

Therefore, current identity management approaches will define how these interactions will look in the future, but different fields and communities often approach management with their own solutions and tools, despite their similarities. This includes decentralized digital identities, where the identity is managed with asymmetric cryptographic keys, and no centralized entity oversees the whole identity system. This paper focuses on managing on- and off-chain decentralized digital identities, with the former being used for blockchain networks and the latter for self-sovereignty and privacy. While both types of decentralized identity build on the same cryptographic and identity primitives, there is no single wallet that handles both. Therefore, this paper proposes an orchestration solution for both wallet types, which enables their convergence to a single universal wallet and validates it with a real-life decentralized identity use case.},

This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that is an emerging technology currently disrupting various fields. The aim of this paper is to explore ways to harness the advantages of blockchain while being implemented to existing systems. A permissioned blockchain can be established through Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) that utilizes ledgers that are interacted upon by a chaincode. An HLF network was established to investigate the custom chaincode. The scenario of the project was grounded on the functions performed in a web-based property inventory management system that uses a centralized database. The chaincode in the project was written using JavaScript and Node.js was used to create the whole chaincode source. A channel was built between the nodes of the blockchain where the chaincode was deployed. Subsequently, to open a gateway to the network, multiple Representational State Transfer (RST) Application Programming Interface (API) were created. Several gateway endpoints were tested through Insomnia, a cross-platform API client for RST. The tests performed employed various request methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) which resulted in evidence that the custom chaincode is fully functional and adheres to the OpenAPI specification. The paper concludes that it is highly feasible and advantageous to integrate a blockchain into an existing Web 2.0 system. Most functions and business logic in existing traditional systems can be reflected in a chaincode with proper planning and execution. In the future, other aspects of the blockchain network will be explored further.},

The development of blockchain technology has shifted from cryptocurrency to decentralized finance, benefiting millions of unbanked individuals, and serving as the foundation of Web3, which aims to provide the next generation of the internet with data ownership for users. The rise of NFTs has also helped artists and creative workers to protect their intellectual property and reap the benefits of their work. However, privacy risks associated with permissionless blockchains have become a major concern for individuals and institutions. The role of blockchain in the transition from Web2 to Web3 is crucial, as it is rapidly evolving. As more individuals, institutions, and organizations adopt this technology, it becomes increasingly important to closely monitor the new risks associated with permissionless blockchains and provide updated solutions to mitigate them. This paper endeavors to examine the privacy risks inherent in permissionless blockchains, including Remote Procedure Call (RPC) issues, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), miner extractable value (MEV) bots, on-chain data analysis, data breaches, transaction linking, transaction metadata, and others. The existing solutions to these privacy risks, such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, Hyperledger Fabric, and stealth addresses, shall be analyzed. Finally, suggestions for the future improvement of privacy solutions in the permissionless blockchain space shall be put forward.},

To support the development of Web3, privacy-preserving decentralized data computing schemes need to be studied. In earlier works, blockchain was used for trusted data sharing. However, due to the lack of computing attribute, blockchain is not capable enough to ensure the trustworthiness of the distributed computing process. Besides, the distributed computing method requires a large amount of data transmission and the current privacy protection researches seldom consider the problem of user privacy. In this article, we design a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving distributed data computing architecture to break-through the limitations of existing researches. The proposed architecture ensures the secure and trustworthy computing with state channel and computing sandbox. We also design a sandbox location obfuscation method based on onion routing technology, making it difficult for attackers to identify the sandbox location or infer user privacy.

Generally, Web3 is decentralized and semantic depending on user behavior, and thus the zero-trust architecture should be created initially. To hasten its arrival, a comprehensive discussion on its architecture and enabling technologies is inspired. Specifically, to access Web3, it is essential to study how to establish an identity management system. Meanwhile, for resource description and data verification, it is necessary to set up decentralized identifiers (DID), and link the data to identifiers in the form of DID document. In particular, a decentralized network operating system is an indispensable underlying technology for Web3, incorporating concepts such as decentralization and user-driven philosophy. Therefore, the corresponding technologies for the operating system such as blockchain and distributed ledger technology should be further studied and developed. Moreover, in order to reduce the consensus cost, a large-scale incentive mechanism is also the basis of long-term sustainability, which can attract and motivate distributed players to participate in the maintenance of Web3. Last but not the least, Web3 is built on a physical infrastructure relying on communication, networking, storage and computing, which is crucial to establishing an effective and secure Web3. This encourages us to study communication, networking, storage and computing in Web3, as well as the specific requirements of running Web3.},

 abstract = {Web3 is a blockchain-powered web evolution. In many situations, Web3 smart contracts require data from outside their applications (off-chain data) via APIs to function as designed. Existing APIs in Web3 facing the most common and critical risks originate through access control vulnerabilities (i.e., Broken Object Level Authorization, Broken Function Level Authorization, and Broken Authentication). Such vulnerabilities during runtime cannot be spotted during the development and testing phases of a Web3 application that integrates APIs. Continuous monitoring is the key to proactive hunting access control attacks, which are not attainable through manual monitoring. In this paper, we design a real-time automated security monitoring approach named the access behavior learning (ABL) model for early detection and prevention of access control attacks before they could cause any damage. In two steps, the ABL approach predicts an attacker's access behavior in response to environmental behavior. First, it verifies the API providers and oracle by defining authentication schemes using OpenAPI Specification (OAS) standard to identify the API endpoints to endorse authenticity. In addition, it validates the oracle-level authentication security schemes for approving authentication. Second, it scans metadata for the current access record and compares it with the previous access records, such as location, application id, and API key, to form a baseline that determines authentication. Using this baseline, ABL determines legitimate application access based on both factors for identifying its authentication. ABL approach retains API security by designing an efficient correlation to enable complex off-chain computation by predicting API access attacks. The ABL approach is evaluated against different Web3 applications with varying levels of access control vulnerabilities where applied for early attack detection and prevention. Compared to traditional manual detection processes, the ABL approach offers early automated detection and prevention of attacks during runtime, which results in enhanced security measures and reduces the risk of potential threats.},

 abstract = {In today’s rapidly growing economy with everincreasing inflation, the purchasing power of money keeps decreasing as time pass by therefore it becomes important to invest money to counter the growing inflation. Real estate investment has been a proven hedge against inflation over many decades. The Real Estate sector despite so much contribution to the financial system has seen relatively less innovation in terms of technology. Blockchain has shown a great affinity towards managing real estate properties and all the transactions involved. Investment in this sector usually requires huge capital as a result, small retail investors are not able to invest. This is where Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) comes to the rescue of retail investors. This paper focuses on the ERC721M token standard and proposed architecture as to how a REIT company can make use of ERC721M to design their Decentralized Asset organization, or simply DAO, which will help them in adapting web3 technologies and bring automation in their procedure of operations with maximum transparency, We have also done a comparative analysis of ERC721Mv/s Standard Deployment and why ERC721M is the best token standard to be suited for creating smart contract interface for such an operation.},

Meanwhile, ensuring interconnections and interoperability among these metaverses is crucial, allowing users to seamlessly transition between different Web3 environments while maintaining their digital identities and assets. In this tutorial paper, we provide an overview of the significance and current landscape of interoperability in parallel metaverses. Furthermore, we identify key challenges in achieving interoperability in parallel Web3 metaverses within the blockchain industry, including the technical complexities and practical business considerations. Then, we suggest that decentralized knowledge inference can be used as a potential solution for facilitating knowledge sharing among parallel metaverses.

Web3 is the internet religious fundamentalism for data rights owned by users based on identity, data, network, and service, which requires the support of full-process data protection provided by a zero-trust and zero-touch environment. However, as to the traditional layered architecture like TCP/IP, data protection is an overlaid function, which is far away from the full-process data protection requirements. To this end, in order to build a zero-trust and zero-touch environment, a Web3 architecture is presented in this article as a promising paradigm. Meanwhile, the key principles for Web3 architecture designing are discussed, covering interoperability and interpretability of data, trustworthiness throughout network lifecycle, incentive for collaboration and sharing, and human-centric experience. Moreover, in order to achieve these principles, four aspects of enabling technologies are presented, including semantic, incentive, decentralized, and spatial technologies. Finally, some main challenges and open issues are also identified as a future direction for further work.},

 abstract = {The current online social network landscape is characterized by competition to get larger audiences leading to massive user migrations which will determine the shape of the future Web. However, user migration phenomena have not been fully understood and their driving mechanisms are still not well identified; in particular, the behaviors of hubs and the influence they exert on their followers are unclear. In this work, we focus on these aspects by analyzing the propensity of hubs to migrate towards a new social platform as a consequence of a shocking event; and the influence they exert on the decision of their neighbors of migrating to a new platform or staying on the native one. We conducted analysis on data made available after a user migration consequence of a hard fork involving two Web3 online social networks based on the blockchains Steem and Hive. Due to the blockchain nature of these Web3 platforms, we got detailed data about social and financial interactions among the users, along with information that allowed a precise reconstruction of the context surrounding the migration. The main findings suggest that different types of hubs apply different strategies when choosing to migrate, e.g. financial hubs diversify their strategy by staying and migrating at the same time. As for hub influence, results suggest that users directly interacting with hubs tend to migrate. In general, findings on influence indicate that understanding the activity and the influence of hubs is crucial in monitoring and controlling the user migration process.},

 abstract = {Online merchandising plays an important role in internet users’ behavior. With the advent of Web3.0 and blockchain technologies, online markets can be adapted to these new changes. In traditional online markets, buying and selling are performed in a centralized manner, which, in addition to the problems of centralized systems, also brings the challenge of users’ trust. One of the challenges in online markets is maintaining the privacy and not revealing the exchanged file to unauthorized entities. Another challenge is to have a mechanism to detect fraud in the market. If the wrong file or key is sent by the seller, the fraud detection mechanism guaranties that the smart contract will be informed and the buyer will be refunded. On the other hand, the seller will be paid if a correct file and its corresponding key have been sent.Blockchain network is not suitable for file storing. Therefore, there are centralized or decentralized methods to store files in building a blockchain based file sharing market. In this work, we selected a distributed file system storage called IPFS (InterPlanetary File system). We integrated IPFS network with a suitable smart contract which is deployed on Ethereum blockchain. We provided a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any dispute that happens between market users.},

However, data integrity is a concern as cloud service providers (CSPs) often cannot guarantee it. Blockchain technology offers a solution to guarantee data integrity and traceability. However, the immutability of traditional blockchain conflicts with GDPR's requirements. To address scalability and privacy concerns, we have designed a comprehensive scheme that integrates the redactable blockchain with the existing revocable IPFS mechanism. Our scheme overcomes the disadvantage of residual downloading information in the traditional blockchain. Additionally, we have developed an enhanced proxy re-encryption scheme that simplifies access control for physicians without the need for complex group key management. Unlike traditional blockchains and P2P file sharing systems, our PHR platform allows for selective removal of records and files while maintaining auditable logs. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively enhances the exclusive revocation feature with acceptable overheads. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide the merit of fully complete record and file revocation on a blockchain-based system.},

A smart contract is an agreement in the form of a cryptographic code digitally signed by the actors. This technology holds the data transaction transparently and securely. The actors may benefit without intermediaries involved in the transaction. Supply chain management will be easily tracked by decentralized data sharing. Supply chain management involves transactions in agricultural sectors such as farmers, village cooperatives units, distributors, and consumers. The Cooperative is a party that buys goods from farmers and sells them to consumers. A smart contract is a digital signature that can access the system in transactions. The system records log activities that show the origin of transactions. All actors can see the transaction of agricultural products stored in the blockchain ledger in the Blockchain. This paper discusses blockchain-based Smart Contract scenario for supply chain management that is simulated and implemented in the Serious Game.

In the context of decentralization, is very important the creation of a smart contract that is stored in the Ethereum blockchain. By using the Web3.js library, it is possible with a smart contract and a MetaMask wallet to carry out the transactions necessary for storing data on the blockchain.To increase efficiency, the IPFS distributed file system is used, which offers storage of larger files or texts and generates their content, while it is possible to access this data.

Blockchain technology integration has the potential to enhance healthcare data management. By incorporating blockchain, healthcare networks can establish trust and ensure data security and privacy. However, existing studies mainly focus on the relationship between patients and hospitals, neglecting the incorporation of insurance aspects such as indemnity and insurance reimbursement. This paper proposed to address this issue by proposing a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare system that encompasses the entire process, from patient registration to payment and insurance claiming procedures. The paper's focus on privacy rules, which enables the systematic management of hospital data in compliance with regulations including the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is a major strength. The legal framework has been carefully examined to facilitate the implementation of this project. The system implemented in this study utilizes Hyperledger Besu, a private blockchain platform. Given the sensitivity of healthcare data, a privacy group and permission settings are employed to prevent unauthorized access. The technical design of the healthcare network and an early-stage prototype are described in detail.},

To protect voter privacy, our system incorporates stealth addresses to conceal ballot content and lightweight ring signatures to verify voter validity without the risk of double voting. Furthermore, our voting system utilizes smart contracts to encourage voting and self-tallying, resulting in improved transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms several existing e-voting systems, thus providing a robust and secure alternative for governments seeking to improve their voting systems.},

The review is followed by pilot-testing the metaverse platforms intersecting with Web3 technologies in real-world, particularly on the use of buy-and-sell, trading and item ownership under decentralized finance and financial technology. Finally, the research assesses the resulting metaverse based on user reviews and experiences on the feasibility of Web3 metaverse. The intersection of Web3 and the metaverse is still an early adoption of IR4.0 emerging technologies, yet the convergence of the metaverse, blockchain technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence is ultimately the precursor to the future Web4.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, crowdfunding has become a popular source for raising funds, especially for startups or projects. Many startups opt for crowdfunding platforms to raise funds by exchanging equity because it is affordable and straightforward. However, concerns related to security, investor abuse, and illegal transactions have emerged, which have led to an investigation of the implications of blockchain technology in crowdfunding. In our proposed system, we integrate the functioning of crowdfunding platforms with the blockchain technology. The system will provide a platform for startup ventures where they can pitch their ideas to potential investors. The investors can invest in the ventures in return of equity. All the process is handled by the smart contracts making it transparent, immutable and secure. This reduces the risk of fraudulent transactions. The main advantage of the system is it uses platform sensitive token that can be exchanged with INR and further converted to ER20 token that can be used to communicate with ethereum blockchain. This eliminates the need of having ethers or any kind of wallet for the investors. We have created a mobile based application using Flutter Framework and deployed the smart contract using truffle. We have created a backend using NodeJs server which utilizes the functions from smart contract by creating the instance for them. We have also used MongoDB cloud atlas as a database along with the Ethereum Blockchain.},

The main objective of this system is to provide immediate access to patient health information while addressing concerns about privacy and security. It is developed on the Ethereum network using programming languages, tools, and technologies such as Ganache, Solidity, and web3.js. The system uses smart contracts to provide security and privacy, and transactions are verified and propagated to the entire decentralized network. The system includes a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) with a centralized privacy system that allows authorized parties to access and secure records quickly. The proposed system aims to achieve several objectives such as allowing users to receive the same data simultaneously, increasing efficiency, building trust, and reducing barriers. It secures data storage by restricting user access and enables the secure transfer of patient medical records. The solution allows for better transparency and ownership of sensitive data, which can be recorded and safeguarded via blockchain technology, therefore assisting the healthcare sector.

 abstract = {The healthcare industry is not immune to the trend of adopting new IT systems, and this includes hospitals and doctors’ offices. To store a patient’s medical history (including diagnoses and treatments), medical history (including diagnostic pictures), and financial data (including demographics and insurance details), a computerised database known as an “Electronic Health Record” (EHR) is used. Because medical records are typically private and must be shielded from prying eyes, ensuring their secure transfer is a top priority for healthcare systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in the proposed study to ensure the security of all sent medical data, including the Chest X-ray MedPix images. This article describes a blockchain-based solution that patients can use to keep all their data in one secure location. This system was built with the Ganache tool on the Ethereum network, making use of Solidity and web3.js as well as other languages, tools, and approaches. In this study, a systematic method is described wherein blockchain smart contracts are used to record patient information and execute tasks in a distributed environment. After a smart contract has been deployed, all transactional communication occurs within its encrypted confines, protecting both the parties and their personal information. As an added bonus, the validated and broadcasted changes intended by the transaction can be checked. To ensure that government agencies have quick access to protected records, there is a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) that stores the information in an encrypted, decentralised manner. Both patients and physicians can use the wallet to log in. In addition, the system will manage and protect all of the doctor and patient’s information. Things like the following are in scope for the proposed system: Users may now access the same information at the same time because to blockchain’s distributed ledger capabilities, which boosts productivity, establishes trust, and lowers barriers to entry. Setting individual permissions for users allows for safe data storage. In addition, the suggested method enables the safe transmission of patient medical records.},

 abstract = {The frequency of software supply chain attacks has reached unprecedented levels, primarily due to the increasing reliance on huge numbers of software and hardware dependencies, and the inherent vulnerabilities they harbor. Currently, vendors providing these software and hardware components share security advisories to centralized databases or post them on proprietary websites, which security engineers have to search manually to find vulnerabilities relevant for their systems. Furthermore, the security advisories often do not follow a standard machine-readable format, which results in the engineers having to manually analyze the documents. In this paper, SENTINEL, a novel solution for automating dissemination and discovery of security advisories leveraging Web3 technologies, is presented. In particular, the Ethereum blockchain is used by vendors to notify asset owners of novel vulnerabilities in their systems in a reliable and accountable manner. Evaluation tests conducted on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet confirm that our proposal is a functional and functioning solution for securely disseminating and discovering security advisories utilizing a fully decentralized infrastructure.

This publicly available dataset contains essential financial characteristics related to borrowing, including balance, loss given default, annual equivalent rate, and probability of default. Additionally, we develop a specialized mathematical model tailored specifically to this project. This model allows us to estimate the probability of default by considering the presence of crypto-collateral and utilizing Brownian motion passage levels.

 abstract = {In the evolution of technology, the Web 3.0 has become the future of the technological world. The web 3.0, which is still evolving, aims in creating an immersive environment which contains smart applications supported by AI and aims in decentralization of data. In the upcoming era, the successor of today’s transactions is most likely to be the transactions through cryptocurrency, which is built on top of the blockchain technology. It is important to make the upcoming technology more reliable, secure, and fast to bring it to real-time use. To overcome the low throughput and high latency of broadcasting in blockchain technology this paper comes up with the pandemic protocol for broadcasting. Communication can be the most important part of any network to work efficiently. It is a communication protocol used for broadcasting which works on the principle of how the pandemic Covid-19 spread. The implementation of this protocol in the blockchain technology to broadcast the transactions can make the technology more efficient and faster. This implementation will be tested for its efficiency and its throughput, analyze its performance, and resolve issues. Overall, this work will help in remove the inadequacies of existing communication protocols thus helping in demonstrating the benefits of this pandemic protocol for communication. The Pandemic Protocol minimizes data redundancy, reducing latency and network congestion, a significant improvement over traditional protocol. In the Web 3.0 era, the Pandemic Protocol’s efficient communication capabilities make it ideal for real-time applications and network scalability. By minimizing redundant data, it bolsters security, reducing the risk of data tampering and strengthening data integrity. Unlike energy-intensive protocols like Proof of Work (PoW), the Pandemic Protocol minimizes resource consumption, making it eco-friendly and cost-effective.},

 abstract = {Among the tokens issued using blockchain, a token that can be identified and unique is called NFT (Non-fungible Token). And an NFT that cannot be transferred is called SBT (Soulbound Token). Since SBT cannot be transferred from an account, it can be used to indicate what the account is. Using SBT in this way reduces the anonymity of blockchain accounts and makes it easier for users to know information about the accounts. Transactions on the blockchain are essentially anonymous. While this brings benefits, it also has drawbacks. In particular, the general public feels uneasy about anonymous transactions, which discourages them from using blockchain. Reducing account anonymity with SBT brings safe and secure transactions to the blockchain. This will remove the anxiety of the general public and lead to mass adoption of blockchain. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted practice with our company's employees as the first effort. First, we prepared a blockchain account for employees who wanted to participate in the practice and issued an SBT to prove that they are employees. And we issued FT (Fungible Token) that is circulated only between accounts that have this SBT. And we have prepared a text chat-based community where only the SBT holders can gather and exchange opinions and information about blockchain. Participants shared their learnings and information about blockchain within this community. FT was actively sent as an acknowledgment for teaching within the community. A post-practice questionnaire suggested that the exchange of FT improved their motivation to learn about blockchain. On the other hand, the participants were more conscious of the UI/UX of sending FT. And they were not aware of the self-sovereignty of blockchain accounts and private keys. It was suggested that excellent UI/UX is important for the mass adoption of Web3 applications. and that only a few users who are interested in technologies may feel the value of self-sovereignty.},

Traffic Officers will ask you to produce them for verification. Carrying these documents physically is a cumbersome task with a high possibility of documents getting lost or in a poor readable form. Remember the authenticity of these vehicle documents are also debatable. With so many flaws in the current system, there is a need for a system competent of reducing the task of carrying these vehicle documents and also guarantees the authenticity and transparency. As per the Motor Vehicles Act in India, it is mandatory that when driving a vehicle, drivers must carry vehicle-related documents such as Registration Certificate Book, Vehicle Pollution under Control (PUC) Certificate, Vehicle Insurance Policy. As a solution, we are proposing a Decentralized Application where drivers can upload and access their vehicle documents details using OCR anywhere, anytime digitally. A Quick Response Code (QR-Code) is used to store URL generated by the vehicle owner by uploading the vehicle documents, which can be later scanned by the Traffic Officer for verification purpose. The application notifies the vehicle owner on expiration of any documents that must be renewed. The application helps in reducing the overhead efforts made by the Traffic officers for vehicle verification. The objective of the system is to digitize all documents, ensure authenticity of documents, eliminate the use of fake documents, manage vehicle documents, reduce the workload and time.},

Blockchain Domain Names act as Digital Identity in Decentralized Internet. Security is major concern in any DNS system and the similar challenges exists in the Blockchain DNS system too. Further, there is a lot of diversity being observed in decentralized internet space as a Domain name in a Blockchain DNS can refer to a website/portal or a wallet or a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) or simply be parked. Also, currently, there is rampant growth in development of decentralized applications with no standards implemented - neither across Blockchains nor regions. Hence, there is a need to detect security exploits carried out using malicious domains in Blockchain DNS system and implement mitigation measures accordingly. In this research work, we study and analyze malicious domain names in decentralized BC system. We explored Ethereum transaction dataset for detecting malicious transactions using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms with good accuracy of 99% and 95% using Decision Tree and 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) respectively. We also applied ML techniques on Ethereum wallet dark list dataset for detection of domain names that were vii used for phishing attacks. We received 96% accuracy after handling data imbalance by Random Forest model. Model predicted nature of domain based on 17 features that were extracted from Ethereum wallet dark list dataset like number of consonants, vowels, digits, symbols and their ratios to length of domain.},

Moreover, innovative technologies introduce a full-immersive metaverse environment for enabling communication between patients and doctors virtually and efficiently. Nevertheless, remote telesurgery operations in the metaverse are susceptible to various security and privacy issues that need to be tackled to secure the patient's confidential health data. Thus, we design an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) for selecting and conducting telesurgery operations based on the doctors' specialization and type of surgery. The proposed application ensures secure and preserved communication between patient and doctor in the metaverse environment by deploying the smart contract in the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). DApp is designed using web3 and JavaScript (JS) to reflect the telesurgery operations to the doctor and patient in the metaverse environment. Finally, the proposed smart contract for the application is evaluated based on parameters such as gas consumption analysis for smart contract functions and doctors registered and cost analysis for smart contract functions.},

One of its key technologies is decentralized identity (DID), which has gained significant attention recently. However, existing DID solutions are not scalable enough to be compatible with the large-scale identity node applications required by Web3 across various fields. To overcome this challenge, we propose the first multi-layer Web3 DID architecture utilizing sharding blockchain, which provides management, scalability, and compatibility. This architecture leverages leader shards and the main chain to establish trust, while regular shards manage DID-related transactions. Specific system processes and query optimizations are also given. Besides, formal security analysis and comprehensive simulation evaluations have demonstrated that the architecture can achieve all proposed security and performance goals, including low latency of down to 2 seconds and high throughput of up to 90KTPS.},

 abstract = {Today, educational data, controlled centrally by educational institutions and administrative units, may be vulnerable to damage caused by natural disasters, political instability, and wars. Simultaneously, challenges arise in accessing this data for educational activities within the framework of exchange programs or lifelong learning. In the literature, there are numerous blockchain-based studies focusing on storing and sharing data in various fields. While several studies exist on blockchain applications for certification, verification, and data sharing in the education sector, a fully decentralized infrastructure has not yet been presented. To address this issue, it is proposed that data control should shift to the hands of students, who are the rightful owners of the data, rather than being solely in the hands of educational institutions. In alignment with the decentralized internet vision, Web3, public blockchain networks are considered the most suitable infrastructure for this purpose. To meet this need, a framework named PublicEduChain has been introduced within the scope of this study. PublicEduChain allows students to store their data in smart contracts created on the public Ethereum network, making it possible to share this information with any educational institution and administrative units. Educational institutions can access student data stored in smart contracts on the public Ethereum network through Learning Management System (LMS) applications and can add data to these contracts. PublicEduChain ensures that data is managed under student ownership within a fully decentralized infrastructure. The practical steps in PublicEduChain, such as creating a smart contract, logging into LMSs with Ethereum IDs, and allowing LMSs to read and write data in the student contract, are explained in detail.},

Influence maximization (IM) has always been a critical technical focus in areas such as viral marketing, network regulation, and opinion monitoring. Currently, a significant amount of existing literature revolves around the optimization of influence maximization problems such as greedy algorithms, heuristic algorithms and classical propagation models. In this paper, we first develop a linear threshold model that is sensitive to the word-of-mouth effect, which appropriately reflects the reputation mechanism of blockchain social networks. Moreover, we have devised an algorithm (CRB) based on community segmentation and community ranking to optimize the operational efficiency of the greedy algorithm. It measures community impact through three attributes: community social score, community density, and community scale. Series experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. Our experimental results reveal the impact of the word-of-mouth effects on decentralized social networks and provide evidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of the CRB algorithm.},

A blockchain-based Web3 application for the management of CO2 absorption rights could be a very effective solution to combat climate change. Blockchain technology allows the creation of permanent and transparent records of transactions in a decentralized network, which makes it an ideal tool for monitoring and managing CO2 absorption rights. The rights could be registered in the blockchain and transferred through smart contracts, which would guarantee the validity and traceability of these transactions. In addition, the Web3 application would allow greater accessibility for users, since it could be accessed from anywhere without the need to have proprietary systems installed. Decentralized applications could also be used to verify CO2 emissions and removals by users, which would increase transparency and trust in the system. This paper presents the development of a novel Web3 application that leverages blockchain technology for managing CO2 absorption rights using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The proposed application allows for the secure, transparent, and efficient management of CO2 absorption rights, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of carbon offsetting initiatives.},

To address this problem and open the way for a secure and efficient society, where the privacy of citizens is paramount, the identity concept and proof of identity mechanisms need to be redesigned from the ground up. In this paper we discuss how the emerging Web3 technologies like distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized storage systems, and crypto wallets can be leveraged to design and implement a decentralized digital identity system based on decentralized identifiers (DID) and self-sovereign identities (SSI). Such a system puts the users in full control over their own data while also providing a solid backbone for building interoperable systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient. We propose different architectures for the decentralized identity infrastructure and storage layer, and also discuss the mapping of these architectures on cloud platforms. The main goal is to provide an architectural blueprint for a scalable, secure, privacy-preserving and trusted system.},

The objective is finding a good trade-off between security, privacy and reliability, without loosing scalability potential. To this end, blockchain technology, previously only applied in the context of cryptocurrencies, has been integrated with IoT applications (BIoT) to fulfill all these needs, bringing a decentralized approach and promoting new business logic ideas to the field. Despite the promising benefits of this integration, BIoT has faced scalability concerns, due to the complex task of handling massive data transactions that can be generated in monitoring IoT applications. In order to contribute with an alternative solution to this problem, this paper proposes a completely decentralized architecture designed for Smart Agriculture. It explores the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS), as a name system that can be updated over time; the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), as a Distributed File System (DFS) to store the IoT data; and a multichain network, built with public and private blockchains, delivering a full Web3 approach that can be applied in IoT data marketplace.

 abstract = {The implementation of blockchain-based token transfers has emerged as a transformative tool for innovation and enhanced financial inclusion. To implement Blockchain based token transfers, smart contracts play a pivotal role in automating complex processes, enhancing efficiency, and driving innovation for tokenized assets and decentralized applications (dApps) that can be run on Ethereum. With rising popularity of smart contracts in 2015, necessity for a standardized token approach within the Ethereum ecosystem is recognized. To address interoperability issues and challenges in exchanging tokens between different applications, the Ethereum Request for Commet-20 (ERC20) standard was introduced through the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) process. Since then, several numerous schemes have been proposed efforts to enhance token transfers and implementations while adhering to ERC-20 standards. Despite the substantial progress made in optimizing the functionality and efficiency of token transfers, achieving a truly user-friendly experience has remained an ongoing challenge. To address this challenge, several schemes have been proposed to refine the user interface and experience associated with ERC-20 token transfers. Our research work proposes a practical approach to address concerns by creating a simple user-friendly decentralized web application (Web3) using smart contracts that adhere to ERC-20 standards. By focusing on the development of a seamless user experience, the system developed aims to empower users to send tokens effortlessly by connecting to various wallets available in the market.},

However, drawbacks to these marketplaces include the platform's ability to block merchants at their own whim, the fees paid to the platform when listing a product and when selling a product, and the lack of privacy of users' data. In this paper, we propose an application that remedies all three of these drawbacks through use of the Ethereum blockchain platform. The application was developed using the Truffle development framework. The application's functions were contained within an Ethereum smart contract, which was then migrated to the Ethereum network. The user's input was read through a web interface and sent to the Ethereum network via the web3.js API. Statistics about the application were gathered on the Rinkeby test network. The application was shown to have an average transaction runtime of 3.8 seconds, and an average gas consumption of 4.6 wei. Contract creation times for the application were shown to be less than a second. A cost analysis of the application was then conducted. The gas consumption of the transactions needed to both buy and sell a product was converted into US dollars, and the gas cost of the application was then compared to the cost to use an online auction marketplace such as eBay as well as an in-person auction house such as Sotheby's. The results showed that selling on the application is cheaper than existing online options as well as existing in-person options. These tests showed that our application was successful in addressing the drawbacks of current auction marketplaces.},

We identify key elements comprising the P2P energy trading platform based on blockchain. The software architecture of our energy trading platform is provided with example codes. We build smart contracts on Ethereum for determination of trading price as well as matching between prosumers and consumers in such a way to balance the surpluses and the demands. At the start of each trading period, the prosumers and consumers send their respective amounts of surplus or demand. And the smart contract for price determination automatically evaluates the price in a predetermined way to balance surplus and demand within the neighborhood. Another smart contract performs matching between prosumers and consumers using this price. Authenticated and private messaging called `whisper' is employed for prosumers and DSO(Distributed System Operator)s to notify injection of surplus energy to the DSO and verify the ownership of the injected energy. Each participant interacts with Ethereum virtual machine through web server built with Node.js, Web3.js and Geth.

 abstract = {Modern day entertainment and music streaming has largely been dependent on digital technologies. People prefer subscription based online services to buying physical copies of the music albums. Online streaming services like Spotify, Apple iTunes, Google Music offer great services to the listener with ease. However, drawbacks to these systems includes long delays in payouts for the artists, lack of transparency, confusing payments and licensing terms. In this paper we propose an application that solves all these three drawbacks by making use of Ethereum blockchain and IPFS protocol. The Ethereum blockchain is used for recording transactions and payment management using smart contracts. As storing large files on the Ethereum network costs a lot, the IPFS protocol is used for storing music files, which is a peer to peer protocol. The frontend is built using Web3.js and both listener and artist interact on the blockchain through browser. A PPP(Pay-Per-Play) model with fixed price or as per artist will be defined in the smart contract. The artist can also add other benefactors and share the pay with them. Streaming will be a free service; however, the listeners can tip the artists for supporting. PPP is a smart contract that will be running on the Ethereum blockchain that will be used to set and reward artists with a fixed set of tokens, native currency of platform, per play. Miners will mine new blocks to be added to the blockchain, for which they will be incentivized with tokens. 25 percent of tokens mined per block will go towards a pool for paying artists for streams of their music. The IPFS nodes for storing and distribution of music will be controlled by the artists. Thus, a complete autonomous system for music streaming can be built with least involvement of third parties, and a direct relationship between artist and listener.},

In the e-FIR database, the offense's record can be compromised due to its centralized nature, and further the intentional registration of false e-FIR can occur. Thus, data integrity and transparency are key concerns in e-FIR database. In this paper, e-FIR data integrity and false registration appended with police stations in a centralized database are addressed via a consensus-based distributed blockchain solution, as an integral part of a smart city environment. Specifically, a smart contract based intelligent framework has been utilized to explore the potential of Ethereum blockchain in providing integrity to e-FIR data stored in a police station's database. Local database is interfaced with Ethereum blockchain using Web3 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol. Multiple simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

Normally people think that they are not suffering or affected by the disease because they do not have symptoms. But it does not necessarily mean a person with no symptom has no chronic disease. This paper presents design and prototype implementation of a blockchain system which remotely monitors patient health records. The patient monitoring system is a big challenge and other security threats arises as the health care data transferred from one to another and authorization to create and read transactions, is a major concern related to data loss. The data loss of the patient protected health information which are generated from the devices should be handled carefully. So in this paper we proposed a solidity based smart contract run over a Ethereum virtual machine to facilitate the secure analysis and storing of transactions from and to the sensors. Using the Ethereum protocol, based on a private blockchain and writing the smart contracts to keep track of the patient health information. We have created an automatic system through which the sensors collects the data, then communicates with the decentralized application via the smart contract. The method inside the smart contract collects data when they are called, also reads and writes transactions of all events on the Ethereum virtual network. This solidity based smart contract system along with injected web3, metamask, and truffle environment would support alert transaction to the patient and medical professionals.},

However, few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0. Our definition is not the only way of understanding ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, in this article, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: ${\mathsf (i)}$(i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and ${\mathsf (ii)}$(ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains.

Blockchain-based systems have shown their effectiveness and ability to solve most security problems related to exchanging systems' transactions. Hence,A decentralized system for exchanging digital documents, using Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), has been proposed to overcome the problems of using trusted third-parties in exchanging digital documents. The proposed system provides immutable and irreversible logs of the process of sending and receiving documents. In this framework, all registered users can encrypt the documents using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm, send, and receive documents using the Ethereum Blockchain's smart contract. The framework was simulated locally using Ganache Blockchain and tested on the official Ethereum test network Ropsten, and the experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The smart contract used in the Ethereum blockchain was written in the Solidity programming language, and the website that was needed to interact with the blockchain was built using React and other different javascript libraries like web3. Additionally, Metamask wallet was used to create the Ethereum accounts which are required to connect and communicate with the Smart Contract that is implemented in the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, the model's results indicated that the model may cost an average of 0.0552$ per transaction, and this shows that the system is affordable. Also, the model has satisfied the three main security requirements which are confidentiality, integrity, and availability by using the suitable countermeasure for each one of them.},

At the same time, due to globalization and other factors, the use of these social platforms is expanding daily, and a variety of activities take place inside these platforms. These networks are centralized, allowing social network-owned companies to track and observe the activities of their users. Therefore, this has been challenged to the privacy of the data of users. Also, these companies tend to sell them to third parties keeping huge profits without users' permission. Since data is the most valuable asset in today's and tomorrow's world, many have pointed out this issue. Even though decentralized, community-driven applications have come to playas a solution to this problem, there is still no successful application that competes with centralized social network platforms. Therefore, this study attempted to develop a decentralized social network architecture with the basic functionalities of a social media platform to assure the privacy of the users' data.},

Data integration problem in healthcare can be overcome by bringing a decentralized system in the hospital organization. This paper focuses on the use of Blockchains in managing medical records for insurance claim. By removing the central administrator, the suggested architecture uses Ethereum smart contracts to create a tamperproof and transparent healthcare system and ensure the integrity of sensitive patient data. Additionally, the smart contract keeps the patient well-informed and governs the communication between all the participants in the network. The proposed approach provides a solution to eliminate fraudulent insurance claims using Machine Learning (ML) with Blockchain.

A record book holds all dealings, timestamps, the hash value of the preceding block, record book compensation, record book number, and others. Each single record book holds a hash value of the preceding record book or block, therefore making a series of record books accompanying one another.

The growing popularity of online shopping has put immense pressure on the supply-chain industry, especially on last-mile delivery. The available solutions suffer from high cost, and lack of transparency. Therefore, assuring traceability of users' actions has become a critical requirement to establish trust between parties. The proposed PackChain framework uses the Ethereum blockchain to offer a crowdsourcing platform for last-mile delivery with autonomous and transparent processes. PackChain provides all the core functions needed for the delivery framework to operate through smart contracts such as managing user information, accepting offers, verifying transactions, and handling payments. In addition, the framework relies on proofs of delivery as an arbitration mechanism between users to release or hold funds. The proposed framework is implemented using Solidity and Web3.js to interact between clients and carriers. The emulation results demonstrate the feasibility and cost-efficiency of the proposed solution11The full code of the smart contract and the related logic is also made publicly available on Github..},

We deliver a sharded blockchain technology with unlimited scalability, called KSI Cash, which is based on a new form of electronic money scheme, the bill scheme. We present performance tests of KSI Cash that we have conducted with the European Central Bank in order to assess the feasibility of a digital euro. We show the system operating with 100 million wallets and 15,000 transactions per second (under simulation of realistic usage); having an estimated carbon footprint of 0.0001g CO2 per transaction. Furthermore, we show the system operating with up to 2 million payment orders per second, an equivalent of more than 300,000 transactions per second (in a laboratory setting with the central components of KSI Cash), scaling linearly in the number of shards. We explain, in detail, the key concepts that unlock this performance (i.e., the concepts of the bill money scheme). The results provide evidence that the scalability of our technology is unlimited in both permissioned and permissionless scenarios, resulting into the Alphabill Money technology. Next, we contribute the architecture of a universal tokenization platform that allows for universal asset tokenization, transfer and exchange as a global medium of exchange, called Alphabill platform. We reveal the crucial conceptual and technical contributions of the platform’s architecture, including the data structures of KSI Cash and Alphabill Money, the dust collection solution of Alphabill Money, and the atomic swap solution of the Alphabill platform.},

Our system guarantees that the in-game assets will remain online long-term, by orchestrating various decentralized services. Thus, users do not risk losing control over the artefacts or their value, even if the gaming company loses interest, or goes bankrupt.

A concept map was created from the information gathered from primary sources to the attributes such as research type, contribution type, blockchain network, smart contract language, development process, testing methods, and testing environment. We also categorized the trends and demographics found in the selected papers based on publication year, author’s country, and more. The results of this systematic mapping showed that this field is very new and quickly increasing with new research.

 abstract = {In recent years, compared to traditional supply chain systems Blockchain technology provides countless opportunities and potential to improve and develop the framework in a supply chain management model. We developed a client-side application which acts as a supply chain management platform built using Blockchain technology and Web3-net that provides access to cutting-edge services which include inventory tracking, order placement and product attribute information log. Cryptocurrency transactions are stored on a shared, digital ledger called a blockchain. This decentralized technology is spread across many computers and records every transaction. The platform provides secure and authentic information to its users at all stages using a decentralized app or DAPP which we have developed to ensure a seamless experience for verifying and maintaining data regarding all inventory parts and orders. This paper gives a model demonstration of the implementation of Blockchain Technology at the industry level. However, additional functionalities can be added in the future with enhanced compatibility.},

The introduction of blockchain technology prompted a new generation of social media based on the concept of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and other Web3 technologies, giving birth to the Metaverse. Decentraland is one such platform, where users can explore a 3D virtual world and communicate with each other. The main feature of Decentraland is that the virtual world is divided into parcels, implemented through NFTs, that can be traded among users and where owners can create buildings or mini-games for other users to play with. In this work, we explore the virtual world of Decentraland by presenting the main details of the virtual world and by focusing on the economic impact of NFT trading on the description of the parcels. In detail, the parcel's description can be used to advertise the proximity of the parcel to infrastructures or special projects to attract potential buyers. This paper's findings show the impact and the magnitude of this phenomenon, highlighting entire quarters that adopt this technique throughout the map by overriding the playful aspect of the platform.},

Nowadays, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are used to poll which may be tampered resulting in incorrect election results. Therefore, an online voting system has been introduced in this research. An Electronic Voting (E-Voting) machine is a balloting machine wherein the election opinions are notated, saved, stored, and processed digitally, which makes the balloting control project complicated than the conventional paper based method. The Election Commission forms elections and enlist party candidates along with the parties for contesting the election. This paper works with the following ideas by having the two different sets of modules: election commission and the voters. An election’s REST API is arranged on Ethereum’s Blockchain, which is the front end. The votes are then stored on the blockchain architecture, to which the Election Commission grants the number of votes. However, there are some limitations due to the fact that the blockchain architecture cannot run on the main net as it must be hosted, and a separate web3 provider must be used for interacting with it due to the lack of public API availability.},

Paper-based profiles and defacement are vulnerable to spoofing, loss, and theft. Digital platforms with efficient IMS boost administrative processes and bring transparency and interoperability among establishments. The traditional paper-based identity systems are slow and rigid. Conventional centralized IMS lack transparency and are vulnerable to single-point failure. This paper presents a blockchain-aware decentralized identity management and access control (BADIMAC) model that mitigates these barriers. BADIMAC allows users to keep their digital identity within their control (i.e., self-sovereign identity). On the other hand, with the help of BADIMAC, service providers across enterprise boundaries can verify their identity without depending on any central authority. BADIMAC offers transparency and better security. The decentralized consensus-based design of BADIMAC enables the verifier to validate claims and establish proof of digital identity with process effectiveness.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a privacy-preserving publish–subscribe-based decentralized framework for MCS systems named “Pub-SubMCS”. The framework allows data sharing, where requesters can subscribe to an existing data request (task) if their requirements match. Otherwise, they can create a new task with specific requirements on considered parameters. Incorporating the publish–subscribe (pub–sub) service model in a decentralized MCS system saves system entities’ sensing and computing resources and the cost of acquiring the data by the requesters. However, the pub–sub service model makes the curse of sensing issues more severe. Pub-SubMCS handles the curse of sensing issues by performing access control using smart contracts, which impose restrictions on data collectors (workers) to publish the data and identify and penalize the malicious workers early. To ensure data privacy and validation simultaneously over blockchain, we perform data transformation enabling the validation algorithm to run over transformed data and thus enhancing trust among the system entities. In particular, we use the normalization technique to transform data and the Pearson correlation coefficient measure to compare the similarity in the collected sensor data. Pub-SubMCS is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, and solidity programming language is used to create smart contracts. The security analysis and experiment results show the proposed system’s scalability, usability, and feasibility. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the publish–subscribe model against the requester–worker model.},

Smart contracts enable prosumers to trade energy units in the Ethereum blockchain with ease via a participatory web platform. The effectiveness of the framework in synchronizing power supply and demand within the VPP by coordinating the charging and discharging of storage systems in accordance with consumption patterns is demonstrated through performance evaluation.

Three themes emerge from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) voting structure, (2) proposal management, and (3) token management. Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose. However, the operations and methods implemented are more oriented toward agency viewpoints due to their reliance on incentive-based processing and are based on a lack of trust among DAO stakeholders.

 abstract = {Objectives
The proposed research aims at attaining several objectives. To start with, it assesses the limitations associated with the current electronic prescription systems. Accordingly, it proposes a proactive method for providing real-time monitoring to prevent overdose prescriptions. The proposed approach should ensure that health providers have access to a comprehensive dataset without state or geographical limitations. More importantly, the research aims to improve drug monitoring to enhance accountability and trust, which are central to promoting drug legitimacy.
Methods
A blockchain-based framework for secure, interoperable, and efficient access to prescription records. The proposed solution, SecureRx, is a web-based application developed on the Ethereum blockchain and RxCheck hub.
Results
Based on the evaluation results, SecureRx is functional as it allows health providers to verify patient history and make informed decisions regarding whether to prescribe opioids. The proposed solution exhibits adequate scalability and handles transactions quickly when the number of nodes is reduced. It is also robust and secure, supports HIPAA compliance, and requires minimal operational expenses.
Conclusions
The safe utilization of medications, especially opioids, continues to be a major problem in the United States and around the world. Part of the reason for this is the inability of health providers to access health databases for patients. Current drug prescription systems are limited in terms of tracking the usage of prescription drugs. The SecureRx framework has highlighted the potential of the record-keeping technology to nurture effective and efficient sharing of information about prescriptions while ensuring the safety and privacy of the original sources of the data.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the network of medical devices, software applications, and healthcare information systems used for remote monitoring and delivery of healthcare services. Despite the several advantages of IoMT for today smart healthcare, security issues are growing due to the inadequate computation, limited storage and insufficient self-protection capabilities of IoMT devices. Authentication of IoMT devices is the main requirement to secure IoMT systems. Although, the recent authentication schemes based on tamper-proof decentralized architecture of blockchain technology are robust and enjoy a high level of security, yet they require high computation, more storage, and long authentication time. These issues lead to reduced scalability and time efficiency, which are necessary for large-scale, time-sensitive IoMT systems. To this end, this paper proposes a novel group authentication framework for IoMT Systems. The group authentication scheme is implemented through a four-phase process, including setup, registration, secret construction, and authentication. To enhance both efficiency and scalability, the proposed group authentication framework employs a combination of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) algorithm, and blockchain-based fog computing technologies. We simulated the proposed framework through the Ethereum platform and Solidity language and its performance is evaluated using the Hyperledger Caliper tool. The simulation experiments of the proposed framework showed that the average latency of authenticating IoMT devices was 0.5 second and the throughput was 400 transactions per second. Our analysis of the proposed framework’s performance against other cutting-edge blockchain-based authentication techniques showed that it outperformed them in terms of latency and throughput. A security analysis of the proposed framework was conducted using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The formal and informal security analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework is secure and resistant to potential authentication-related attacks. We also noted that the average latency of the proposed framework maintains a fairly narrow range when the number of submitted transactions rises, indicating that it supports the scalability of the IoMT system.},

 abstract = {Medical equipment plays a crucial role in the global healthcare industry, towards the delivery of high-quality medical care and contributing to positive patient outcomes. The traditional method of handling pre-owned medical equipment often leads to improper disposal of functional devices in landfills, compelling healthcare providers to invest in costly brand-new equipment. Several proposals have been put forth to establish trading platforms that facilitate the resale of pre-owned medical equipment. However, existing solutions are characterized by a centralized approach, and face challenges related to traceability, certification, system se-curity, and equipment reliability. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that is capable of orchestrating the resale, leasing, and auctioning of pre-owned medical equipment. Blockchain smart contracts are utilized to automate the resale and leasing process, register stakeholders with authenticity, transfer and verify ownership, and maintain public reputation scores of entities. A comprehensive overview of the architectural components, sequence diagrams, and algorithms that define the operations of our solution is provided.

 abstract = {Voting is a fundamental democratic activity. Many experts believe that paper balloting is the only appropriate method to ensure everyone’s right to vote. But this method is prone to errors and abuse. Many nations utilize digital voting methods to solve the difficulties of paper balloting. A single flaw in digital voting may lead to massive vote-rigging. Election voting methods must be legal, accurate, safe, and convenient. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict acceptance. Due to its end-to-end verification capabilities, blockchain technology was developed to address these problems. To guarantee We have used blockchain technology anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting. By using blockchain our proposed system ensures security, privacy, and integrity. This system provides voter anonymity by keeping the voter information as a hash in the blockchain. It also provides fairness by keeping the casted vote encrypted till the ending time of the election. After ending time, the voter can verify their casted vote, ensuring verifiability. To test our protocol, we put it on Ethereum 2.0, a blockchain platform that uses Solidity as a programming language to create smart contracts. The adoption of smart contracts provides a safe means for performing voter verification, ensuring the correctness of voting results, making the counting system public, and protecting against fraudulent activities. We analyzed the system’s performance based on security and gas costs. It improves in terms of security characteristics and the related cost for the necessary infrastructure.},

 abstract = {The utilization of blockchain technology in the fishing industry has been extensively studied and implemented to address issues such as illegal fishing and carbon emissions control. However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain. While solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria. Despite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.},

The need for a comprehensive study addressing BC bloat solutions arises due to the scarcity of knowledge in this emerging area. This study advances knowledge along with practical insights and inspires innovative approaches to address BC bloat. This research explores various techniques proposed to combat BC bloat. Two technique themes are identified: on-chain and off-chain techniques. On-chain techniques focus on updating the consensus mechanism, block size, or database partition. This study identified five on-chain techniques: structural modification, pruning, sharding, ephemeral BC, and zk-SNARKs. Off-chain techniques focus on processing in parallel, bundling transactions, or handling transactions off-chain. Further, three off-chain techniques identified are off-chain storage, historical data storage, and light clients’ techniques. These recommendations aim to optimize resources use, enhance scalability, and maintain data integrity. However, these may compromise several BC capabilities, such as security, privacy, and data loss. The applicability of these techniques for resource-constrained devices is also explored. Future research should include further investigation into the performance and applicability of these techniques, especially in resource-constrained environments like IoT and fog computing.},

 abstract = {At present, technological systems lack a secure and transparent method for tracking goods and preventing theft in e-commerce, leading to trust issues and data vulnerabilities. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that integrates Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, and advanced cryptographic techniques to address these challenges and enhance the security and transparency of transactions. This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions. This work highlights the transformative potential of blockchain technology and decentralized protocols in revolutionizing security and transparency across diverse sectors.},

 abstract = {The main objective of this article is to present a prototype that integrates blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to digitize information across a generic Supply Chain (SC). Blockchain bring many benefits to the operation of improving provenance and reliability, such as, digitizing the interaction among SC actors to allow implementation of smart contracts to support a secure and authenticated chain. In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.},

 abstract = {The emergence of the Web3 paradigm has led to more and more systems built on blockchain technology and relying on cryptocurrency tokens – both fungible and non-fungible – to sustain themselves and generate profit. The growth and success of these platforms are strongly dependent on the growth and evolution of the trade relationships among users. In this context, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanism behind the evolution and growth dynamics of these economic ties: however, in these systems the trade relationships are strictly intertwined with social dynamics, posing significant challenges in the analysis. One of the most important mechanisms behind the evolution of social networks is the triadic closure principle: given the strict link between social and economic spheres, the mechanism emerges as a potential candidate among mechanisms in literature. Therefore in this work, we extend the existing methodology for triadic closure studies and adapt it to directed networks. We performed an analysis centered around 3-node subgraphs known as “triads” and statistically significant triads referred to as “triadic motifs”, both from a static and temporal perspective. The methodology was applied to various decentralized socio-economic networks with distinct levels of social components. These networks include currency transfers from the blockchain-based online social media platform Steemit, trade relationships among NFT sellers and buyers on the Ethereum blockchain, and a blockchain-based currency designed for humanitarian aid called Sarafu. Our measurements show how triadic closure is relevant during the evolution of these platforms and, for a few aspects, more impactful than centralized online social networks, where triadic closure is also incentivized by recommendation systems. Moreover, we are able to highlight both similarities and differences across networks with different levels of social components, both from a static and temporal standpoint. Overall our work presents strong evidence that triadic closure is an important evolutionary mechanism in decentralized socio-economic networks. Our findings provide a stepping stone in the study of decentralized socio-economic networks. Understanding the evolution of other decentralized networks, not following the same Web3 paradigm or with different social components will provide valuable insight into the understanding of dynamics in decentralized systems and potentially improve their design process.},

 abstract = {The effort to reach the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations has incentivized the adoption of IT solutions in many fields. Many systems for sustainable economic development are now relying on a digital form making them more accessible and provides the access to new functionalities. A very interesting example of such systems are complementary currencies i.e. cooperative currency systems that support national economies to provide humanitarian aid and promote sustainable development. While there are many studies on the principles and case studies of successful complementary currencies, many aspects are still unexplored, especially regarding cooperative behavior. Cooperative behavior in these systems is a key aspect, as complementary currencies are often born out of cooperation among members that face a period of crisis or they usually have the objective of creating bonds of reciprocity and integrating social networks between people, which should lead to increased cooperation. However, there is a lack of studies on many aspects of cooperative behavior in complementary currencies, such as how such behavior changes over time, especially in times of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover how cooperation behavior is affected by time and different geographical locations is still unclear. In this work, we analyze Sarafu, a complementary currency that went digital and now relies on blockchain technology. Sarafu is a successful case of a complementary currency that was used for humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, Sarafu is a perfect case study for the study of cooperative behavior, as it implements a special type of account, the group account, to support cooperation groups. This feature supports the study of group dynamics and behavior. What we find is that Sarafu users exhibit strong reliance on cooperation groups; we also observe that the interaction of users and cooperation groups is influenced by both time and geographical location. The study of group accounts and in general mechanisms that promote cooperation can be useful for other humanitarian or community development projects. Moreover, similar cooperation enhancers could have an important role in other social development projects, and in general, in any setting where there is a strong need to foster cooperation for reaching social good.},

 abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.},

IIoT devices usually have limited computational power, while IIoT applications are mostly mission-critical and/or safety-critical. Therefore, these applications need computing resources that are closer to the devices. This work proposes a decentralized auction-based resource allocation mechanism in edge computing enabled IIoT using consortium blockchain and smart contract that shelves the involvement of a trusted third party, i.e. auctioneer. Various quality parameters are considered during resource allocation to address the mobility of both IIoT devices and edge resources, heterogeneity of edge servers, false assurance of edge servers, reliability, delay in results, and responsiveness of edge servers. Utility functions for IIoT devices are designed to calculate their degree of satisfaction depending on various quality parameters. The proposed blockchain-aided auction based mechanism fulfills various auction-based resource allocation requirements such as seal bidding, no impersonation of the bidder, no modification in any bid or result of allocation by the auctioneer, and proof for winners. The proposed work encourages edge servers for truthful bidding and furnishes the allocation results in polynomial time. Performance evaluation of the proposed model exhibits encouraging results.},

With this approach using Ultra High Radio Frequency (UHF-RFID), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain-based smart contracts, a fast shipping management architecture that ensures security between the parties is provided. In this context, an automatic payment and approval mechanism is established between the parties using ethereum-based smart contracts. In addition, shipments equipped with RFID tags are automatically tracked and traceable using UHF-RFID antennas. The IoT data collected in the study are stored on a cloud-based server, which is a cost-effective solution. Smart contracts that enable communication between the parties are written in the Solidity language using the Ganache, Truffle and Metamask platforms.

The Metaverse is an imagined future space where these building blocks of neoliberal production and consumption are delinked. We examine these changes through the affordances of cryptocurrencies, algorithmic collectibles, and NFTs. We seek to disambiguate these efforts at disintermediation through online auctions and speculation. We present practical implications for artists, art institutions, buyers, and investors. We theorize new forms of ownership with fractional ownership and fractionalized property rights. And we seek to understand why some consumers pay astronomical prices for digital art that includes simple and often silly artwork with limited property rights. To do so we distinguish alternate, but sometimes overlapping, buyer motivations in the wild world of crypto art as we purportedly move toward the Metaverse.},

 abstract = {With the rapid growth of cloud computing, an increasing number of individuals and businesses are opting to store their vast data on the cloud in order to cut data maintenance costs and obtain more easy access. The cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing scheme has provided many benefits in recent years, but the centralization of the cloud raises challenges to privacy protection and data security. Blockchain technology is viewed as a possible solution to these challenges because of its unique properties of unforgeability, anonymity, and verifiability. Therefore, a blockchain based secure data outsourcing scheme is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, each activity on outsourcing EHRs is recorded as a transaction on the public blockchain, authenticity is ensured by registration, and secure data access is ensured by keyword search. Initially, the EHR is encrypted by the proposed Enhanced Map Chaotic Encryption (EMCE) algorithm to ensure confidentiality. Then, data de-duplication is performed by the proposed Tri-Level Chunk Hashing (TL-CH) technique to eliminated duplicate records and reduce the storage space. Finally, the integrity of outsourced EHRs is validated by the Third-Party Auditor (TPA). The performance and security analysis show that the proposed scheme can provide solid security against various attacks, and the storage space is reduced.},

 abstract = {The progress in industrial and corporate blockchain technology, particularly the pioneering fintech financing methods rooted in blockchain like Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Security Token Offerings (STOs), has the potential to disrupt across industries. These innovations offer creative solutions to address longstanding challenges. However, the novelty of these concepts has given rise to issues related to information asymmetry among investors, exacerbated by the opinions shared on social media platforms. To comprehensively analyse the trends of these technologies and their societal impact, as well as their influence on the contemporary business landscape, we conducted a study in the social platforms X (formerly known as Twitter) analysing 59,453 tweets using natural language processing (NLP). Through this research, we have identified key topics such as investment security or corporate challenges that provide valuable insights and structured information essential for industry stakeholders. In summary, this study explores the dynamic interplay between blockchain technology, ICOs, STOs and social media in the industry. It sheds light on the sentiment and implications of the use of this technology and these emerging financial models, offering a nuanced understanding of their impact on the market. Thus, the idea that user opinions play a crucial role in influencing decisions is supported, and their impact can fluctuate depending on the changing dynamics of the market.},

 abstract = {Research on blockchains addresses multiple issues, with one being the automated creation of smart contracts. Developing smart contract methods is more difficult than mainstream software development as the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. We report on a new approach to developing smart contracts with the objective of automating the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce the risk of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into the processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

We investigate business ventures leveraging blockchain technology to manage the intellectual property life cycle, in other words how intellectual properties are created, protected, managed and monetized. Our research method is a multiple case study examining a total of 120 use cases. across all primary types of intellectual properties including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, industrial design and geographical indications. The empirical validation is based on an in-depth within-case analysis of 26 applications which were selected from the initial 120 cases based on business maturity and popularity criteria. Our goal is to understand which intellectual property challenges distributed ledger technology is trying to solve and how. We also investigate which blockchain benefits, in terms of technological security, immutability, decentralization, tokenization or disintermediation are promoted by these applications. We triangulate our case study results using a PESTEL coding framework to better understand how the blockchain ecosystem manages the intellectual property life cycle and to provide scholarly researchers and practitioners with insights on how enterprises can use distributed ledger technology to enhance the management of the intellectual property value chain. Moreover, we validate theoretical findings through the evidence collected from our multiple case study analysis, and finally we provide strategic guidance in investigating the current and anticipated challenges of blockchain entrepreneurs to drive further distributed ledger innovation.},

One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment.},

They could enable a wide range of applications, from down to earth to futuristic. One of the main issues in achieving wide adoption of tokens is onboarding: main platforms require users to deal with specific tools such as wallets, transaction fees, key generation, and storage. The most common solution to offer a familiar experience to naive users are custodial intermediaries, which have the important drawback of centralizing the process, and keeping users away from the advantages of self-sovereign assets control. In this paper, we present a process for the distribution of digital tokens to end users, exploiting “physical” objects for initial distribution. The process is aimed at making the onboarding of users not yet accustomed to blockchain tools and concepts as easy as possible, in a secure and decentralized way.},

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.},

The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified — one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon. This is to promote transparency and verifiability within and among government processes.},

 abstract = {The ever-increasing reliance on loot boxes by the video game industry has attracted scrutiny from consumer groups and regulators. For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities. Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity, accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution.},

 abstract = {The management of construction projects requires adequate techniques to support the continual exchange of information across disciplines. Recent advances in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have exposed new ways for process and data integration with open data formats, process mapping, and terminology. In construction projects where multiple disciplines produce and share BIM data, mechanisms for defining information priority, provenance and suitability become necessary in order to have consistent and traceable use of data. This includes objects or collection of attributes for data objects that are associated with a discipline or organisation including clear identification of the transaction that has introduced the information. Blockchain can be used to record metadata of BIM objects such as the issuing discipline, object version and responsibility/ liability associated with the data. Blockchain can offer the capability to apply levels of “trust” to individual BIM objects and a more secured framework of collaboration across stakeholders. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based BIM data provenance model to support information exchange in construction projects. By testing the solution in a real-world bridge construction scenario, it has been shown that the approach can recognise the levels of competence and can improve the process of BIM implementation. The proposed approach gives stakeholders more confidence when sharing their BIM data, reduces costs, and improves risk contingencies in construction projects. The paper provides a cost analysis to evidence the implications of using Blockchain for BIM data provenance through an experimental framework supported by an Ethereum public test network. A front-end web page has also been created to facilitate interaction with smart contracts and to monitor the BIM data provenance process.},

 abstract = {Existing permissioned blockchain systems designate a fixed and explicit group of committee nodes to run a consensus protocol that confirms the same sequence of blocks among all nodes. Unfortunately, when such a permissioned blockchain runs on a large scale on the Internet, these explicit committee nodes can be easily turned down by denial-of-service (DoS) or network partition attacks. Although recent studies proposed scalable BFT protocols that run on a larger number of committee nodes, these protocols’ efficiency drops dramatically when only a small number of nodes are attacked. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol named Eges that leverages hardware trusted execution environments (e.g., Intel SGX) to develop a new abstraction called “stealth committee”, which effectively hides a committee into a large pool of fake committee nodes. Eges selects a different stealth committee for each block and confirms the same blocks among all nodes with overwhelming probability. Our evaluation shows that Eges is the first efficient permissioned blockchain’s consensus protocol, which simultaneously satisfies two important metrics: (1) Eges can tolerate tough DoS and network partition attacks; and (2) Eges achieves comparable throughput and latency as existing fastest permissioned blockchains’ consensus protocols. Eges’s source code is available on http://github.com/hku-systems/eges.},

To address the above concerns, various auction designs have been proposed by researchers from the academic and industrial circles. However, most of them fail in simultaneously achieving decentralization (i.e. auctioneer-free), privacy-preserving (i.e. bids privacy), collusion-resistance, and secure-channel free. In this paper, we present an effective smart contract-based verifiable privacy-preserving sealed-bid reverse auction scheme, which not only has no need for trusted third parties, but also achieves robustness and privacy protection of losing bids even in the face of overwhelming collusion. In this scheme, the central auctioneer is replaced with some carefully designed smart contracts for decentralization, while zero-knowledge proof and anonymous veto networks are used to avoid the secret communication channel, support the public verifiability and detect the malicious behaviors of bidders. More practically, the complexity of the designed scheme is independent of the number of bidders. Finally, we implement a prototype of our design based on a locally simulated Ethereum test network. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the scheme is the high efficiency and practicality.},

 abstract = {Electronic Commodity Trading has a pivotal role in our economic activities. In the literature, there is a classic problem called “Fair Exchange” which is fundamental to electronic commodity trading. It means the participants can receive the exchange item of the counterparty as they have agreed on before. Since the ownership of items online is often authorized by digital signatures, we focus on the problem of the fair exchange of digital signatures in this paper. As the concept of the Metaverse becomes popular recently, what we are concerned about is how the fair exchange will evolve in a metaverse. It is said that the metaverse is a vision of how the next generation of the internet will operate and the research for the fair exchange problem in it is essential for a wide range of applications like trading a (Non-fungible-token) NFT. Many cryptographic fair exchange protocols are proposed to deal with such a problem. However, most of them should rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and the security is restricted by the TTP. The way the metaverse will work is still being defined. But it will probably provide users with a decentralized environment and a fair exchange protocol relying on a TTP seems unsuitable for it. Recently, researchers present some blockchain-based fair exchange protocols to get rid of or reduce the power of a TTP. But these blockchain-based protocols face new challenges. Firstly, cryptography pairing operations are often contained in such a TTP-free protocol and cost too much for the blockchain. Secondly, the player may hang for an unacceptably long time of the latency of the blockchain network. Thirdly, it is difficult to protect the privacy of the signatures while making the whole protocol verifiable at the same time. To bridge these research gaps, this paper presents a novel signature exchange protocol called DFSE which is decentralized, verifiable, efficient and autonomous. To give a real-world evaluation, we perform the experiment on the live test network of Ethereum and the results show that our protocol is feasible.},

 abstract = {More edge users opt to use Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect their data (e.g., health data, social data, e-governance data, etc.), which are stored in central cloud service providers (CSPs). However, this compromises data privacy and creates issues with collusion attacks. Current ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) schemes with and without blockchain have only partially addressed these issues. Ongoing challenges remain to be resolved, including large-universe attribute management, secret key verification, and malicious attribute authorities (AAs) tracking. Therefore, we propose a decentralized access control scheme (namely BLUMA-CPABE) integrating blockchain with multi-authority ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (MA-CP-ABE). The scheme not only supports large-universe, policy hiding, and AAs tracking, but it also utilizes on- and off-chain mechanisms to alleviate the computation burden of the blockchain. In addition, we develop a verifiable key distribution approach in which AAs are configured as blockchain consensus nodes capable of issuing, signing, validating, and disseminating secret keys as transactions on-chain. It guarantees the keys’ security and reliability. To incentivize authorities to control newly added attributes proactively for large-universe, we enhance the Proof-of-Authority (called PoA＋) consensus mechanism in multi-authority scenarios. It allows authorities to take turns proposing and confirming new blocks based on three contribution indicators: attribute management contribution, data decryption contribution, and block validation gain. The proposed scheme is proven statically secure while resisting collusion attacks. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our scheme.},

For this purpose, health standards and semantic web technologies were used for the formal expression of both the insured individual's data and contract terms. Accordingly, a fine-grained data access policy was applied for evaluating contract terms on the basis of relevant data captured in healthcare settings. A prototype was implemented involving the development of several different smart contracts for the Ethereum platform as well as the necessary visual environment for accessing them. The developed system validates various features related to blockchain and smart contract features that are briefly discussed in this work, part of which can be mitigated or resolved through the use of a private permissioned blockchain. The application of well-established techniques for potential malfunctions of external services could also boost the security of the system and prevent it from potential attacks.},

 abstract = {New digital technologies generate large amounts of information. This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services and products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing personal data may result in the extraction of sensitive information, which, in turn, may lead to jeopardizing the users’ privacy. To mitigate this significant risk, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union elaborated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation forces Service Providers to obtain Data Subjects’ explicit consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. Nevertheless, the GDPR’s legislative text does not define how Service Providers must transparently demonstrate that they already have these consents. Moreover, most individuals do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither does this regulation provide them with efficient methods to be aware of what third parties are doing with such data. In order to address this situation, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. The new solution provides public access to immutable evidences that reflect the reached agreements between Data Subjects and Service Providers. In this way, Service Providers can effectively demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are able to control and manage their personal data according to their legitimate rights. We have implemented the new system, and we have performed a detailed study which includes: GDPR-compliance, provided functionality, security and privacy issues, and the cost in terms of gas and US dollars of the different operations to be run on the blockchain.},

 abstract = {The popularity of blockchain technology has bootstrapped many “Web3” applications, e.g., Ethereum and IPFS, that apply distributed ledger technology to store transactions. The amount of transactions generated and stored in such Web3 applications is significant and, in its raw form, usually not searchable by users. Existing Web3 transaction indexing and search engines are predominantly centralized and, therefore, can manipulate search results or censor particular queries. With the proliferation of Web3 transactions and applications, a decentralized and censorship-resistant search primitive is becoming essential. We present DeScan, a decentralized and censorship-resistant indexing and search engine for Web3. Users index their local Web3 transactions using custom rules that output triplets. Generated triplets are bundled in a distributed transaction graph that is searchable by other users. To coordinate search and distribute the storage of the transaction graph over peers in the network, we build upon a Skip Graph (SG) data structure. Since the Skip Graph does not provide any resilience against adversarial peers that censor searches, we propose four modifications to improve its robustness. We implement DeScan and conduct experiments with up to 12 800 peers and 10 million Ethereum transactions. Our experiments show that DeScan with our modifications enabled can tolerate 20% adversarial peers and 35% unresponsive peers without disruption. Moreover, we find that searches in DeScan are usually completed well within a second, even when the network grows. Finally, we show that storage and network costs are evenly distributed amongst peers as the network grows.},

Blockchain technology is being used in many applications majorly in cryptocurrencies and bitcoin applications. Verified transactions which make a block and group of such transactions or blocks are immutable making the blockchain more secured and reliable. Blockchain achieves decentralization of power, trust, and secured of being hacked, which solves major problems or issues with the current systems. Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain platform because of its unlimited block size. Many complex problems with smart contracts can be implemented with Ethereum and the eradication of third party organizations interfering in transactions helps solving the issues of financial crisis and it is easy to implement compared to other blockchain technologies. There are certain limitations/issues in processing large number of transactions due to lack of speed in processing the transactions. Ethereum Blockchain code will be executed by different clients with varying speed and the performance level will be different. The goal of this paper is to understand Ethereum transactions and perform the comparative analysis of Geth and Parity ethereum clients on the private blockchain. In this paper, a private blockchain network is setup where the nodes will share the data among peer nodes or blocks within the network. Using this network setup a democracy voting application is developed which makes use of the blockchain to store and process the data, smart contracts are deployed to execute the transactions. Performance analysis of the two most popular ethereum clients Geth and Parity is carried out considering time, consistency and scalability parameters. Results interpret that the overall transactions are 91% on average faster in parity client as compared to Geth client.},

In this paper we show how it is possible to apply this increasingly popular concept to a traditionally centralized and opaque digital process: Access Control systems. To this aim we expand the XACML standard for Attribute Based Access Control systems with the novel concept of private attributes, i.e. attributes whose values should not be disclosed while still contributing to a policy evaluation result after user consent. Basing our proposal on blockchain systems, we show how to leverage smart contracts and zero knowledge proofs to allow for transparent policies evaluation without disclosing the value of such sensible attributes.

The next stage of transitions will lead to a shift from large-scale, centralized systems to networks of small-sized, distributed electricity systems, which require distributed or decentralized ledgers for database management for efficient transactions. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) are a form of decentralized ledgers where the transactions (energy, information, and money) among various entities are maintained. One such DLT is blockchain technology which offers several advantages. Data recorded in blockchains are difficult to tamper with; have privacy protection; facilitate fast, accurate, and real-time settlement of financial transactions. Contemporary research has started focusing on their possible applications in energy systems. State-of-the-art suggests that while business and market aspects have been extensively discussed, the electrical constraints and implementation methodologies have not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, all the reviewed projects have implemented only peer-to-peer transactions that are not scalable. To incorporate the new entities like prosumers, inter-microgrid transactions, and interactions with the legacy power grid, new structural and operational frameworks are necessary. The proposed research explores the possibility of developing blockchain enabled smart microgrids (BSMG) with the above frameworks. It aims to build a conceptual framework of BSMG, including the transaction protocols and process flows. It proposes the inclusion of network constraints in a three-level transaction setup executed over a four-layered architecture. Another practical challenge is that BSMGs may be set up on different blockchain platforms. Hence, this paper also proposes implementing Inter-Blockchain Protocol for the first time to include interoperability and communication between different platforms. Finally, the performance metrics that will be used to validate the BSMGs are outlined.},

Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data’s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.},

However, privacy disclosure risks concerning service provision and users’ accessing behavior also increase. Traditional privacy protection approaches involve a centralized system with a third-party administrative server, which has the risk of single-point failures and overlooks the issue of privacy information leakage concerning users’ behaviors. Blockchain is a decentralized and traceable technology that provides a reliable solution for secure access by users. This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based secure access framework (BSAF) for cloud-device service collaborations with privacy protection. Specifically, a key matrix encryption mechanism is used to protect the privacy of users’ behaviors, and a fully homomorphic encryption mechanism is designed to protect the privacy of service content. Two smart contracts are designed: a request verification smart contract to verify the access rights of users, and a behavior punishment smart contract to audit users’ access behaviors. Comprehensive experiments on the Ethereum blockchain network show that the proposed BSAF framework outperforms existing schemes in latency reduction and cost saving, and is more suitable for low-profile IoT devices.},

 abstract = {This perspective proposes that, by virtue of its sophisticated trust and consensus finding mechanisms, blockchain has the clear potential to substantially upgrade the processes and organization traditionally underpinning academic science and commercial technology development comprising funding, project delivery, generation of intellectual property, documentation and publication. For supporting this hypothesis, striking analogies between the concepts underlying blockchain technology with research are identified, and applied to the generation of verified knowledge in science and technology development. It is then elaborated how a blockchain-enabled token economy can efficiently and transparently incentivize and coordinate an integrative and community-inclusive participatory approach to fuel crowdsourcing of collective intelligence for contributing ideas, work, infrastructure, funding, data, validation, management, assessment, governance, arbitration and exploitation of projects. Quality, credibility and direction of projects are optimized by demanding collateral “skin-in-the-game” from contributors based on blockchain-enabled staking, reputation systems and prediction markets. This way research progress emerges as a chain of community generated and independently vetted blocks of scientific knowledge; these new blocks are concatenated with the state-of-the-art according to transparent consensus mechanisms.},

 abstract = {With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies in the construction industry, information is exchanged digitally with little regard to the contracts that govern them. Although parties collaborating in project design are contracted to the client, they transact with each other when using BIM and other collaborative practices without any direct contractual relationship among themselves. This results in a lack of design liability control and an increase in claims and disputes. Further, the use of multiple software packages results in the exposure of data to third parties, data corruption and compromise in data privacy (using data for unintended purposes), data integrity (unauthorised access to sensitive data), and data longevity (loss of data post-handover). This study investigates blockchain technology (BCT) to address these issues using a design science research method. The current information exchange processes were mapped to identify the critical transactions that may benefit from record-keeping on the blockchain. Next, a prototype was designed to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed BCT integrated process models. Three key project processes, design review, design coordination and request for information; and two potential conflict scenarios during and post-construction were simulated as part of the evaluation. The prototype's implementation exhibits BCT's ability to record snapshots of individual design inputs to the overall project design and to enable a clear and long-term record of key exchange transactions. This improves the design liability control for contributing stakeholders and the auditability of the exchange records. Further, the proofs derived from such a system are independent of any third-party storage or subscription. Given the nature of records stored in a blockchain, the existence, integrity, and authenticity of information along with its associated metadata can be verified in the long-term as well. Therefore, BCT could be a supplementary technology that supports the existing information exchange systems.},

 abstract = {In the context of extreme societal polarization, activists have mobilized to protest injustices and claim their rights, yet such efforts often fall short of goals because demands normally are directed to government or firms that offer superficial responses. Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.},

 abstract = {This research proposes a system to store transaction records from a payment gateway based on digital payments by utilizing blockchain technology and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as distributed storage. In digital payments, the possibility of online fraud or theft of customer data is a problem that needs to be solved. Although the solution is to use a Payment Gateway with security standards to prevent these problems, the system is still centralized and vulnerable to the possibility of system failure or data changes by irresponsible people. Blockchain furnishes a secure and unalterable record for documenting payment transactions. Conversely, IPFS presents a decentralized and immune-to-censorship approach for storing and accessing data. The usage of these technologies guarantees the secure storage of payment transaction data and related documents (such as invoices and receipts) while effectively thwarting data manipulation or censorship attempts. Therefore, this research aims to build a blockchain technology system to increase security and maintain the integrity of the data generated from the Payment Gateway. This research using distributed data storage using IPFS to save transaction from the payment gateway data. Based on the evaluation and security analysis results, implementing a blockchain technology system to store transaction records from digital-based payment gateways can improve data security and integrity. In the gas fee increase analysis, the gas fee will increase according to the total number of bytes generated when the transaction is made, where each byte will cost 12 gwei to pay the gas fee.},

However, there are major consequences when gas and coal are burnt to meet this surge in energy needs. Although these fossil fuels are still essential for meeting energy demands, their combustion releases a large amount of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. This significantly jeopardizes community health in addition to exacerbating climate change, thus it is essential need to move swiftly to incorporate renewable energy sources by employing advanced information and communication technologies. However, this change brings up several security issues emphasizing the need for innovative cyber threats detection and prevention solutions. Consequently, this study presents bigdata sets obtained from the solar and wind powered distributed energy systems through the blockchain-based energy networks in the smart grid (SG). A hybrid machine learning (HML) model that combines both the Deep Learning (DL) and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) models characteristics is developed and applied to identify the unique patterns of Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) cyberattacks in the power generation, transmission, and distribution processes. The presented big datasets are essential and significantly helps in identifying and classifying cyberattacks, leading to predicting the accurate energy systems behavior in the SG.},

In a blockchain-based PPGIS, the collected data are securely saved on the blockchain. The validity of the data, replicated on the nodes of the peer-to-peer blockchain network, is ensured through a consensus process without any central control. The data is tamper-free and immutable. Additionally, the data is openly accessible to institutions and citizens. A prototype PPGIS was developed as a DApp through which users can participate in the site selection of urban facilities. Using the application, they compare and rank different criteria. The system solves an analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weights of the criteria. A suitability map is generated afterward and published to be used by both citizens and decision-makers. The feasibility of the application, along with the issues that need to be considered while using blockchain technology for urban planning and development, are thoroughly discussed.},

Thus, in contrast to earlier iterations of the web, Web3 users are asked to trust the technology itself rather than the human intermediaries. On its face, this shift to a trustless web calls into question the traditional conceptions of and requirements for trust. However, in this article, we caution against claims that advocate distrusting Web3 on the basis that, despite how quickly Web3 technology is advancing, the psychological processes through which people perceive and make sense of the social world remain fundamentally unchanged. Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research. Overall, this article provides critical guidance to brand managers, policy advisors, and academics seeking to understand, build, and trust Web3 technology.},

Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms.

 abstract = {After the success of the Bitcoin blockchain, came several cryptocurrencies and blockchain solutions in the last decade. Nonetheless, Blockchain-based systems still suffer from low transaction rates and high transaction processing latencies, which hinder blockchains’ scalability. An entire class of solutions, called Layer-1 scalability solutions, have attempted to incrementally improve such limitations by adding/modifying fundamental blockchain attributes. Recently, a completely different class of works, called Layer-2 protocols, have emerged to tackle the blockchain scalability issues using unconventional approaches. Layer-2 protocols improve transaction processing rates, periods, and fees by minimizing the use of underlying slow and costly blockchains. In fact, the main chain acts just as an instrument for trust establishment and dispute resolution among Layer-2 participants, where only a few transactions are dispatched to the main chain. Thus, Layer-2 blockchain protocols have the potential to transform the domain. However, rapid and discrete developments have resulted in diverse branches of Layer-2 protocols. In this work, we systematically create a broad taxonomy of such protocols and implementations. We discuss each Layer-2 protocol class in detail and also elucidate their respective approaches, salient features, requirements, etc. Moreover, we outline the issues related to these protocols along with a comparative discussion. Our thorough study will help further systematize the knowledge dispersed in the domain and help the readers to better understand the field of Layer-2 protocols.},

 abstract = {We consider a real-world problem faced in some blockchain ecosystems that select their active validators—the actors that maintain the blockchain—from a larger set of candidates through an election-based mechanism. Specifically, we focus on Polkadot, a protocol that aggregates preference lists from another set of actors, nominators, that contain a limited number of trusted validators and thereby influence the election’s outcome. This process is financially incentivized but often overwhelms human decision makers due to the problem’s complexity and the multitude of available alternatives. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) to help the nominators choose the validators in an environment with frequently changing data. The system structures the relevant multiple attribute problem and incorporates a dedicated active learning algorithm. Its goal is to find a sufficiently small set of pairwise elicitation questions to infer nominators’ preferences. We test the proposed solution in an experiment with 115 real nominators from the Polkadot ecosystem. The empirical results confirm that our approach outperforms the unaided process in terms of required interaction time, imposed cognitive effort, and offered efficacy. The developed DSS can be easily extended to other blockchain ecosystems.},

It is necessary to build a provenance model for a large number of blockchain transaction, which can be used to find out which link has trouble and who is responsible once a problem occurs. However, the existing blockchain transaction data analysis methods have low traceback accuracy for data provenance. Therefore, a novel blockchain transaction provenance model with graph attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. The graph attention mechanism is used to identify the traders. Then, a triplet data structure is built to record provenance information and express the relationship between transaction amount and traders. Finally, the smart contract is used to implement the proposed provenance model. The provenance information can be searched through the interface provided by the smart contract when the traceback is required. In addition, the real large-scale Bitcoin transaction dataset Elliptic is used to compare the proposed method with other existing methods. The experiment show that the proposed method achieves state of the art results of the traceback accuracy.},

 abstract = {Today massive amounts of data are generated from Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors that can be streamed in real-time and utilized for building valuable services. As the demand for data sharing has increased, a new business model of data marketplace has emerged that allows individuals to sell their data to buyers for monetary gain. However, these data marketplaces are prone to various threats such as unauthorized data redistribution/reselling, tampering of data, dishonest data ownership claims, and trade of bogus data. The existing solutions related to data ownership traceability are unable to address the above issues due to ambiguous data ownership, undisclosed data reselling, and dispersal of data ownership across multiple marketplaces. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a novel blockchain framework, TrailChain, that uses watermarking to generate a trusted trade trail for tracking the data ownership spanning across multiple decentralized marketplaces. Our solution includes mechanisms for detecting any unauthorized data reselling within and across marketplaces. We also propose a fair resell payment sharing scheme that ensures the resell revenue is shared with the data owners over authorized reselling. We present a prototype implementation of the system using Ethereum. We perform extensive simulations to demonstrate TrailChain’s feasibility by benchmarking performance metrics including execution gas costs, execution time, latency and throughput.},

 abstract = {The rise in the cost of essentials affects every nation around the world, but it has become a major concern for developing nations. It is getting increasingly difficult to keep up with rising prices for everyday items in these countries, where the majority of the population is from the middle class or lower middle class. Inflation, pandemics, wars, and other important variables all contribute to price increases. There may be another significant factor at play, which is supply-chain corruption. The supply chain's unreliable, chaotic, and opaque nature is to blame for this corruption. We are concentrating on the agri-food supply chain in our study. Because many of the current agri-food supply chains are intricate and challenging to monitor, dishonest parties can exploit the situation. Therefore, we suggested a thorough blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to identify the source of price increases. The private Ethereum blockchain was used in the suggested system. Since the private Ethereum blockchain is more efficient, safe, and fast, it was chosen. Smart contracts were created to describe the system and its underlying rules and laws. Furthermore, in order to showcase the usefulness of our smart contracts, we exhibited a sample decentralized application to support our hypothesis. We also gave the system a complete security and vulnerability assessment to make sure it is operating properly and is protected from threats and attacks. Due to the use of blockchain, the system is immutable, transparent, and simple to track and monitor. The proposed system has demonstrated greater transparency, traceability, reliability, speed, security, and cost-efficiency compared to conventional systems. It effectively traces the origin of corruption in the supply chain, providing a more straightforward means to tackle concerns related to price hikes.},

 abstract = {We develop an optimization framework to increase network scalability and to incorporate a priority level for essential transactions based on the Internet of Things and Application (IOTA) Tangle network for a blockchain-enabled next-generation industrial network. Firstly, we propose a model to count newly arrived tips (transactions) into a selected timeframe and calculate the transaction time before joining the Tangle network as a new tip. Selecting secure transactions for approval requires an accurate tip selection method. Secondly, we develop the Best Tip Selection Method (BTSM) to increase network security and to incorporate the priority level for essential or prioritized IoT transactions. Thirdly, we develop a multiple-objective unconstrained optimization strategy, the Best Approver Selection Method (BASM). The objective of BASM is to optimize the trade-off between the multiplication of network latency and the cumulative weight of transactions and approvers’ Tangle time after joining the network. Finally, we estimate the probability of malicious attacks on a Tangle network by assuming the transactions’ cumulative weight increases linearly with transaction arrival speed to a Tangle. We adapt the fault-tolerance relationship to secure the system. We then analyze our model to decide that requires us to consider the trade-off between these two factors to obtain the optimal value. Our results show that BTSM and BASM are viable solutions for next-generation Industrial IoT networks with fast machine-to-machine communications. Compared with IOTA and other existing strategies, our proposed model offers the advantage of identifying the probability of malicious attacks with high accuracy; thus minimizing malicious attacks and optimizing the network latency for next-generation Industrial IoT networks. In summary, the proposed mechanism would allow adding more transactions from IoT devices to the IOTA Tangle and discourage existing malicious transactions from verifying new transactions. The proposed mechanism could be utilized in real-world applications, including enabling preference levels for essential or prioritized activities and fault-tolerance adaptation. IOTA aims to play a vital role in the next-generation industrial revolution; our study advances the IOTA Tangle to move a step forward towards this direction.},

 abstract = {The language barrier is the biggest obstacle for users watching foreign-language videos. Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker’s revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.},

The study examines six pilot projects led by three prominent international NGOs across four countries to identify obstacles to innovation, adoption, and scalability that may arise in this context. The research applies human-centered design theory, combined with the multiple case study method, to generate a cross-case synthesis, revealing common threads, specific trends, key reflections, angles of analysis, and design approaches that can facilitate this work in the future. The findings and conclusions from this study aim to be useful and relevant to practitioners, private sector actors, and researchers. The research aims to address existing research gaps and promote a more informed, coordinated, responsible, and rigorous research agenda and community of practice for the use of blockchain applications in the humanitarian sector. Throughout the discussion, this study highlights the frictions related to variables such as context, agency, and participation. A framework for analysis, focused on four key variables: process, people, program and product, is proposed to provide a basis for comparative analysis, and eventually, a series of propositions for interested stakeholders. The study concludes that blockchain technology has the potential to address cost and time inefficiencies in cash and voucher assistance, but success of implementation is highly dependent on design, context, and stakeholder engagement. The paper recommends continued research in this area to further validate findings and expand the use of blockchain technology in humanitarian and development programs. It also emphasizes the significance of integrating these variables into novel approaches to uphold ethical and professional standards in humanitarian work.},

This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.},

Hence, how to ensure data security and prevent unauthorized data access is the key problem to be solved in the cloud edge collaborative architecture. However, due to the heterogeneity of edge devices and the diversity of data sources, traditional access control methods cannot meet the requirements of the large-scale, distributed, dynamic and flexible expansion of edge intelligence applications. Therefore, this paper studies the fine-grained data access control method on the basis of smart contracts, and implements the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model through smart contracts. To improve the query efficiency of attributes and policies in the process of access request decision, an attribute management scheme is designed on the basis of the Bloom filter to achieve fast retrieval of attributes and policies. The decentralized fine-grained access control method is tested under the performance indicators such as retrieval delay, deployment delay, rule reduction rate and decision response time.},

Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework.

This research aims to investigate the power of Blockchain technology to provide real-time and non-intrusive continuous authentication for the IoT environment. Accordingly, a distributed and scalable continuous authentication solution based on Blockchain technology called CAB-IoT was proposed. It enabled fog nodes layer that tackles the limitations of IoT resources by providing localized processing of heavy continuous authentication-related tasks for a group of IoT devices. Besides, CAB-IoT introduced a trust module that depends on the face recognition machine learning model to detect outliers and abnormal access. Moreover, mutual authentication between end-users and fog nodes is also designed, as well as secure communication between the authenticated nodes. The results demonstrate a lightweight continuous authentication solution that achieved the desired balance between security and performance requirements where it was observed in a real-world environment for truly performance results. Security analysis and attack analysis are also considered during the evaluation.},

 abstract = {Corruption and lack of transparency remain critical challenges in governance systems around the world. These issues are often perpetuated by centralized systems and their manipulation by system administrators. Furthermore, the lack of data ownership and the monetization of user data by tech companies further increase concerns about transparency. In light of these concerns, this study aims to review existing blockchain-based governance models and identify best-practice governance models focusing on corruption transparency, their characteristics, and components. The research will also examine the role of a token economy in addressing trusted third-party issues related to asset ownership management. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of smart contracts, blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Web 3.0, and multifactor challenge set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFSSIA) as modern technologies to combat corruption and achieve transparency in the public sector. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) comprising peer-reviewed journals, proceedings, and book chapters published between 2012 and 2023. Using the SLR methodology, 45 primary and supporting studies have been selected for result extraction and analysis. Finally, we discovered seven blockchain-based governance models with their characteristics and primary components.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging field of technology with a huge scope of its applicability in various industries and a wide range of societal needs, including medical sciences. However, IoT suffers from many limitations like energy, resource constraints, scalability, security, availability, etc. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another similar technology that has many features that are capable of solving many of the limitations of the conventional IoT system. So, suitably incorporating SDN technology into the conventional IoT system, an improved version of IoT namely an SDN-based IoT network system has been evolved. This system is capable of resolving many of the limitations of IoT. Since this newer SDN-based IoT version is enriched with better energy and resources, it can undertake higher computational loads to resolve security issues. In the security domain, Blockchain is a state-of-the-art security-based technology in recent times which has already been implemented in the fields of cryptocurrency effectively. So, Many research opportunities emerge out in adapting Blockchain-based technology suitable for the SDN-based IoT Networking domain. This paper deals with the investigations carried out by the past researchers on various security aspects of the IoT, SDN, and SDN-based IoT systems and their solutions using various technologies, including that of Blockchain. It was concluded that the convergence of Blockchain in IoT and SDN and its combination (SDN-based IoT) resolved many security issues. Many prominent research gaps still persist here to be resolved. This can be dealt with as a future scope of research opportunities in the domain.},

A federated average learning of recurrent zeroing neural dynamics designed self-adaptive fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FAL-ZND FOPID) controller is proposed for distributed frequency control of networked microgrid (NMG) system. By employing a blockchain-enabled distributed control system and implementing supplementary control, the proposed method efficiently regulates the frequency of P2P energy trading. The contract participation matrix, which facilitates the transmission of energy demand information from consumers to prosumers, is computed as part of the supplementary control. Thus, it provides the power reference signals to prosumers who participate in ancillary frequency services. Overall, the blockchain implementation ensures that the transfer of signals remains secure from cyber threats. To showcase this concept, the prosumer and consumer nodes are established within the blockchain network using Raspberry Pi devices. These devices are then connected to the NMG setup in OPAL-RT through the socket interface and communicate via TCP/IP protocol.},

 abstract = {Electronic auctions (e-auctions) remove the physical limitations of traditional auctions and bring this mechanism to the general public. However, most e-auction schemes involve a trusted auctioneer, which is not always credible in practice. Some studies have applied cryptography tools to solve this problem by distributing trust, but they ignore the existence of collusion. In this paper, a blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving and Collusion-Resistant scheme (PPCR) for double auctions is proposed by employing both cryptography and blockchain technology, which is the first decentralized and collusion-resistant double auction scheme that guarantees bidder anonymity and bid privacy. A two-server-based auction framework is designed to support off-chain allocation with privacy preservation and on-chain dispute resolution for collusion resistance. A Dispute Resolution agreement (DR) is provided to the auctioneer to prove that they have conducted the auction correctly and the result is fair and correct. In addition, a Concise Dispute Resolution protocol (CDR) is designed to handle situations where the number of accused winners is small, significantly reducing the computation cost of dispute resolution. Extensive experimental results confirm that PPCR can indeed achieve efficient collusion resistance and verifiability of auction results with low on-chain and off-chain computational overhead.},

MiC offers a range of benefits including cost-effectiveness, high productivity, and high sustainability for construction industry. Multiple stakeholders in MiC project, such as project client, module manufacturer, logistics company, and building contractor, normally use their own proprietary and centralized Enterprise Information System (EIS). However, stakeholders are facing challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. “Islands of Information” issue is commonly existing and creates information fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple stakeholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines. Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress traceability, and real-time KPI visualization & evaluation, but also improves the information reliability, immutability, and transparency in MiC projects.},

 abstract = {Abstract:
Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.},

 abstract = {Summary
The humanitarian sector has emerged as a powerful mechanism of legitimation for blockchain technology. Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a decentralized crowdsensing framework for multiple requesters with multiple workers built on Ethereum blockchain- SenseChain. Crowdsensing frameworks utilize workers’ sensing capabilities to fulfill requesters’ sensing tasks. While crowdsensing is typically managed by a centralized platform, the centralized management entails various challenges such as reliability in workers’ selection, fair evaluation for payment distribution, potential breach of users’ privacy, and high deployment cost. The proposed solution, SenseChain, is a decentralized crowdsensing framework developed to run on Ethereum blockchain to mitigate said challenges while increasing users’ engagement, with reasonable cost. SenseChain is developed around three smart contracts: (1) User Manager Contract (UMC), (2) Task Manager Contract (TMC), and (3) Task Detailed Contract (TDC). These contracts implement the platform features such as maintaining users’ information, publishing tasks from multiple requesters, accepting reservations and solutions from multiple workers, and evaluating solutions to calculate proportional payments. The framework is implemented using Solidity and Web3.js, where a real publicly available dataset is used. The framework performance is compared to a centralized greedy selection framework to demonstrate its comparability while mitigating tackled challenges. The results in terms of solutions quality, time cost, and workers traveled distance confirm its viability as a solution for crowdsensing.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of behavior prediction for task allocation in blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. Centralized crowdsourcing frameworks complement workers’ reputations with predicted behavior, through Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve the task allocation performance and maintain worker engagement. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks allocate tasks to workers using reputation solely, which neglects the impact of a task’s context on the worker’s behavior. Our contribution is an on-chain behavior prediction ML model for task allocation on top of a proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. The ML model, hosted on blockchain, reflects a worker’s unique behavior for a task given its context. The proposed ML model is: (1) trained off-chain since it has lower monetary cost compared to on-chain training, and (2) deployed on-chain as a smart contract to enable transparent predictions. The task allocation mechanism in the proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework considers workers’ predicted behavior and a Quality of Information (QoI) metric that includes distance to the task, completion time, and workers’ reputation. The evaluation conducted confirms that the proposed task allocation mechanism, implemented using Solidity, outperforms the benchmark in terms of percentage of allocation, workers’ QoI, and reputation change.},

 abstract = {Confidentiality, availability, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation when together became the top priority for secure communication. However, authentication is the first line of defense in all these security parameters. Unfortunately, several authentication mechanisms in the traditional methods cannot provide secure communication due to various vulnerabilities such as single point of failure and privacy issues. Furthermore, key distribution mechanisms such as Certificate Authority (CA) and Trusted Third Party (TTP) distribute keys over the central architecture fail, thus secure communication cannot occur. As a solution to these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new decentralized blockchain-based identity authentication mechanism for VoIP networks, VoIPChain. The proposed scheme utilizes the main features of the blockchain platform, such as immutability, transparency, and fault tolerance, to provide data privacy and secure communication in VoIP applications. The proposed scheme is evaluated as an actual implementation using the virtual Ethereum platform and Python language. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is an efficient and cost-effective solution for the call process as a decentralized identity authentication system in VoIP. In addition, end-to-end secure call performance outperforms the existing blockchain-based authentication mechanisms by 30%–70% in terms of average time delay. The proposed scheme is almost ten times faster than the TLS process to authenticate between parties. Moreover, compared to fast but less secure basic methods over the SIP authentication the proposed scheme has an acceptable time delay in a call process.},

Once the objectives and target audience of a digital project are defined, the selection of suitable BPs is undertaken. The primary objective of this research is to develop a decision support system that aids in the selection of BPs for transferring digital data and assets. Numerous quantitative parameters determine the performance of BPs, alongside qualitative parameters indicating their performance. In this study, the aim is to determine the performance of BPs based on both qualitative and quantitative parameters. Within this scope, a multi-criteria decision-making approach and interval-valued spherical fuzzy (IVSF) sets are adopted. IVSF sets are utilized to determine expert importance levels. The IVSF-criteria importance assessment (CIMAS) method is introduced for the weighting of criteria. IVSF-CIMAS enables the determination of reliability levels in calculating criterion weights. The IVSF-simple weighted sum product (WISP) method is formulated to obtain the performance ranking of BPs. Thus, in this research, the IVSF-CIMAS-WISP hybrid model is developed, and an algorithm for this novel decision-analytic model is presented. A case study is developed focusing on BP selection for a digital project to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed hybrid model. The robustness of IVSF-CIMAS-WISP is tested through extensive sensitivity analysis scenarios. According to the research results, the applicability of the IVSF-CIMAS-WISP hybrid method is supported and its robustness is confirmed. The research findings provide numerous insights for project managers and practitioners.},

 abstract = {In conventional PKI, CAs are assumed to be fully trusted. However, in practice, CAs’ absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates’ validation, storage, and entire revocation process is conducted in CertLedger as well as Trusted CA certificate management. During a TLS connection, TLS clients get an efficient proof of existence of the certificate directly from its domain owners. Hence, privacy is now perfectly preserved by eliminating the traceability issue via OCSP servers. It also provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the security and performance of CertLedger and provide a comparison with the previous proposals. Finally, we implement its protoype on Ethereum to demonstrate experimental results. The results show that the performance of the TLS handshake and certificate validation through CertLedger is significantly improved compared to the current TLS protocol.},

In this research, we develop a decentralized blockchain application called TokenTrail, which focuses on the specific traceability requirements of multi-hierarchical assembly structures.

To overcome the challenges of managing liaison transformations, we develop an assembly token manager based on the semi-fungible ERC 1155 token, which enables a direct representation of complex assembly processes and structures containing unique parts and batches within one smart contract.

 abstract = {This paper proposes a conceptual framework for implementing blockchain technology to enhance traceability, transparency, and authenticity of a 3D printed product. An implementation framework is developed using blockchain technologies to record and trace critical attributes during the various life cycle phases of a 3D printing value chain, viz. raw material extraction, chemical processing, polymerization, filament production, 3D printing, and end-of-life recycling of the product. The information on critical attributes of carbon footprint, workers' age, and material flow during the entire value chain is captured to provide authentic output of carbon footprint and labour age during any of the value chain activity. The uniqueness of the current work lies in offering a series of immutable transactions using blockchain technology to comprehend the circularity of 3D printing material and account for the overall carbon footprint produced by a 3D printed product considering its whole value chain. This would improve the traceability and visibility of the material supply chain for 3D printing. On the hindsight, the proposed framework is expected to assist the manufacturing firms to act as responsible manufacturers by providing the authentic data for the computation of environmental assessment as well as social issues of child labour throughout the value chain.},

 abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with traditional healthcare systems has improved quality of healthcare services. However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as “BDSDT” is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99% using both datasets.},

 abstract = {In recent years, COVID-19 has impacted millions of individuals worldwide, resulting in numerous fatalities across several countries. While RT-PCR technology remains the most reliable method for detecting COVID-19, this approach is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, researchers have explored various machine learning and deep learning-based approaches to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases using X-ray images. Machine learning based models can reduce costs and have shorter processing times. However, preserving patient confidentiality poses challenges within such third-party-controlled systems, potentially failing to safeguard patients from potential disgrace and discomfort. Nonetheless, blockchain technology offers the potential to securely store sensitive medical data anonymously, without requiring third-party intervention. Consequently, the combination of deep learning and blockchain might offer a viable solution to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring patient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model of blockchain and deep learning model for automatically detecting COVID-19 using chest X-rays (CXR). The deep learning model includes a stacking ensemble of three modified pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models: VGG16, Xception, and DenseNet169. The model obtained an accuracy of 99.10% and 98.60% for binary and multi-class respectively. Further, to ensure COVID-19 patients’ privacy and security, the Ethereum blockchain has been adopted to store information related to COVID-19 cases. In addition, a smart contract on the blockchain has been designed for handling X-ray images in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).},

 abstract = {To abate global carbon emissions, there has been an unprecedented push for carbon transparency in the manufacturing industry. However, with products becoming increasingly complex, they contain sub-assemblies with components that have sub-components supplied by different manufacturers. This creates a multi-tier supply chain that complicates the propagation of sustainability information necessary to compute the product's carbon emission due to the lack of oversight and potential loss of information from manufacturers in the multi-tier supply chain. Blockchain technology, characterized by its immutability, visibility, and traceability, is a promising medium to propagate sustainability information. Despite the fact that many papers have proposed a system that is viable for products with a multi-tier supply chain in the literature, we have not seen its proof-of-concept yet. This work first proposes a blockchain-enabled system that enables the propagation of environmental sustainability information in a multi-tier supply chain. This paper describes the architecture of the proposed blockchain system and the data structure of each block in the blockchain. Based on the defined architecture, we implemented the proposed blockchain system with Ethereum and tested it using the pseudo-multi-tier supply chain of a torchlight.},

Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted.

Despite considerable progress, most ZDM approaches focus on the accuracy of the inspection process, often neglecting critical factors for application in the shop floor. On one hand, near real-time methods are needed for early defect detection and containment. On the other hand, data scarcity is an issue causing AI methods to overfit. Another concern is the accountability of AI results, since even if an AI pipeline is successfully deployed, its predictions are not verifiable in the long term. In this work, we explore a real-time solution based on lightweight Deep Residual Networks and Blockchain technology to address these issues. Concretely, we propose a two-phase training strategy to boost the performance of baseline classifiers while maintaining low inference times. The performance of the proposed methodology is presented in two different industrial use cases with strict timing requirements, one concerning battery assembly line and the other antenna manufacturing. We validate the proposed method for defect detection and compare the results with common training strategies demonstrating an improvement of 3% and 10% in F1-score and accuracy on the two cases respectively, while lowering inference time by 2.2× compared to existing light architectures.

Aiming at the high latency and low efficiency of pbft algorithm in green technology innovation, a low latency consensus algorithm ipbft based on an alternative voting mechanism is proposed. Explore the influencing factors of domestic realization of green technology innovation, clarify the reasons that hinder green technology innovation and give reasonable strategies to help domestic green technology innovation work to be carried out faster and better. This article compares the ipbft algorithm with the improved consensus algorithms cpbft, vpbft and pbft in recent years. Experimental results show that the consensus delay of the ipbft algorithm is much lower than that of the other three algorithms, and the average delay of the ipbft single consensus is only about 370ms. In different transaction volume and different node number throughput performance tests, the ipbft throughput in these two tests is better than the other three algorithms. In the view switching phase, the ipbft algorithm also takes less time than the other three algorithms. The above results show that the ipbft algorithm has lower consensus delay and higher throughput, which can reduce network communication overhead and save system transmission energy consumption. It can ensure the security and authenticity of information in the green technology innovation based on blockchain, and reduce system overhead.},

However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.},

For example, a compromised CA can issue illegal or fake certificates for any domains, and a CA can issue unauthorized certificates without the consent of the domain owner. In addition, some high-value target domains, such as banks and government agencies may have been frequently attacked, and the adversaries can launch the targeted attacks by making use of the disclosure of the issuing CAs. To address these pressing issues or challenges, in this work, we propose a novel blockchain-based PKI framework using linkable ring signatures, called LRS_PKI. Specially, we propose a novel certificate issuance mechanism that utilizes linkable ring signatures to hide the issuing CA, so as to reduce the risk of the PKI system being attacked. Additionally, we introduce the blockchain as a public log to record the certificate operations, and adopt the decentralized storage IPFS to store the certificates to decouple the blockchain layer and storage layer. In order to prevent the CA from issuing unauthorized certificates, we have added a condition to verify whether the issuing CA is consistent with the previous issuing CA in the certificate verification. The security analysis and experimental results show that LRS_PKI is both secure and efficient.},

After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.},

 abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a task assignment technology that has emerged in recent years, enabling companies to reduce costs and increase work efficiency. Most of the current crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) built on blockchain focus on solving privacy issues and use rigorous proof protocols for task and solution security. Such systems cannot be directly applied in mobile environments because it would lead to excessive computational overhead for the endpoint. To achieve confidentiality of crowdsourcing tasks during transmission while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices and optimizing task assignment results, in this paper, we develop a blockchain-based crowdsourcing model. We first build a model structure consisting of basic components, such as users, smart contracts, and blockchain, and design contracts to implement various crowdsourcing operations, such as registering, publishing tasks, and acquiring solutions. Unlike before, the ciphertext of the task and the encrypted secret key are embedded into the contract. This, together with the three operations we designed for users to interact with the smart contracts, can effectively protect the crowdsourcing data from being stolen while using the address anonymity of Ethereum to ensure the privacy of users. During task assignment, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to delineate each valid service area and implement the established multiobjective planning model within each area to achieve as many benefit goals as possible in the best way. Finally, we implement our prototype on the Ethereum test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that the cost overhead of the designed model is acceptable to mobile users, and the security analysis establishes the confidentiality of the designed operations.},

Conventionally, centralized/distributed database-based traceability platforms are adopted by many drug companies to control drug quality and improve transparency levels. However, it is still challenging to link drug stakeholders into an information-sharing chain due to the potential data manipulations and interest conflicts. In this context, this paper proposes a unified five-layer Blockchain and Internet of Things-based smart tracking and tracing (BIoT3, in short) platform to provide a decentralized traceability solution in the drug supply chain. Following the five-layer blockchain platform architecture, a practical roadmap is provided for the drug industry to achieve blockchain design, development, application, and evaluation. Moreover, three core enabling components are presented: IoT-based drug identity management, on-chain & off-chain mechanism, smart contract-enabled drug services. According to the real data from collaborating companies, the feasibility and efficiency of the BIoT3 platform have been verified using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The case study demonstrates that it not only gains useful insights into transaction sizes configuration for optimal blockchain performance, but also provides a feasible blockchain-based solution for drug traceability and visibility.},

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly vendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain platform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case in terms of feasibility and scalability.},

 abstract = {Traditional centralized token exchange (CEX) has been suffering from hacking due to the centralized management of users’ tokens. In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) maintains users’ assets by smart contracts in a decentralized manner, but introduces additional overhead in terms of gas fee and transaction confirmation latency. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the benefits of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is criticized for two issues. First, trading transactions are time-consuming and expensive for frequent token traders. Second, excessive simultaneous transactions might cause the pending transaction congestion in the Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate the pending transaction congestion. Besides, we propose the very first gas-price vs. transaction-confirmation-latency function to guide Ethereum transaction issuers to choose an optimal gas price that minimizes the overall cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the cost in the proposed HEX with that in the conventional HEX. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing gas fees and transaction confirmation latency for frequent traders as well as the pending transaction congestion in Ethereum.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a widely deployed technology to provide innovative services in many several fields such as industry, logistics, healthcare, and energy management. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge/cloud computing, 5G networks, big data analytics, and other emerging technologies in IoT systems is leading to the emergence of Smart Systems that support devices to make autonomous decisions in order to improve and facilitate people’s lives. These smart IoT devices produce a huge amount of sensitive data. Thus, establishing Trust between these devices is vital to ensure the security of the sensed data and for the normal functionality of smart systems. To address these challenges, several Trust establishment protocols have been proposed, but they have some limitations such as centralization, the need for human intervention, and the lack of adaptability to smart devices with computation and storage constraints. In this paper, a decentralized trust establishment protocol is proposed for smart IoT devices and is applicable for different scenarios. The protocol provides decentralized identity management, mutual authentication, access control, and secure communication by combining Blockchain technology with PV-SAS-MCA message cross-authentication protocol based on Short Authenticated Strings (SAS). To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to propose a new approach that uses Blockchain as an extra distributed and authenticated channel to exchange Short Authenticated Strings without physical interaction. This helps to allow entities in the Smart IoT environment not only to identify each other but also to exchange their public keys in a secure manner. Moreover, the proposed protocol uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure communications with significantly smaller key sizes and lower computation overhead. Experimental results reveal that the time required to complete the authentication process is less than 90 ms which is a superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art decentralized authentication mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are the backbone of critical infrastructure found in power, water, manufacturing and other industries. An ICS controls a physical plant through the use of sensors and actuators. A Historian sits on a plant network and receives, parses, and saves data and commands transmitted over the network, across the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors and actuators. This data has at least two uses. One use is to check for any process anomalies that may occur due to component failures and cyber attacks. The other use of this data, and the focus of this work, is to serve as critical input to off-line activities such as forensic analysis. A cyber attack on the Historian could jeopardize any forensic analysis be it for maintenance, or discovering an attack trail. In this work, a novel architecture, named ICS-BlockOpS, is proposed to secure plant operational data recorded in the Historian. ICS-BlockOpS is designed to enhance data security along two dimensions: immutability and redundancy. An integrity checking mechanism, in combination with blockchain, is used to ensure data integrity. Data redundancy is achieved by applying an efficient replication mechanism and enables data recovery after an attack. A prototype implementation of ICS-BlockOpS uses Ethereum blockchain in the local network as part of the tamper proofing mechanism. The implementation is in an operational six-stage water treatment plant. The underlying design ideas are generic and could be applied to other ICS as well.},

Traceability enables verifying signals’ history for security or analytical purposes.

Smart Contracts (SCs) firmly guarantee these two requirements due to the blockchain’s immutable distributed ledger and secure cryptographic consensus rules. Thus, SCs emerged as an appealing technology for monitoring applications. However, the cost of using public blockchains to harvest these guarantees can be prohibitive, especially with the considerable fluctuation of coin prices and different use case requirements. In this paper, we introduce a general SC-based IoT monitoring framework that can leverage the security features of public blockchains while minimizing the corresponding monetary cost.

Specifically, vaccine safety is strongly linked to global health and security. However, the main concerns regarding vaccine record forgery and counterfeiting of vaccines are still common in the traditional vaccine supply chains. The conventional vaccine supply chains do not have proper authentication among all supply chain entities. Blockchain technology is an excellent contender to resolve the issues mentioned above. Although, blockchain based vaccine supply chains can potentially satisfy the objectives and functions of the next-generation supply chain model. However, its integration with the supply chain model is still constrained by substantial scalability and security issues. So, the current blockchain technology with traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus is incompatible with the next-generation vaccine supply chain framework. This paper introduces a model named “VaccineChain” - a novel checkpoint-assisted scalable blockchain based secure vaccine supply chain. VaccineChain guarantees the complete integrity and immutability of vaccine supply records to combat counterfeited vaccines over the supply chain. The dynamic consensus algorithm with various validating difficulty levels supports the efficient scalability of VaccineChain. Moreover, VaccineChain includes anonymous authentication among entities to provide selective revocation. This work also consists of a use case example of a secure vaccine supply chain using checkpoint assisted scalable blockchain with customized transaction generation-rule and smart contracts to demonstrate the application of VaccineChain. The comprehensive security analysis with standard theoretical proofs ensures the computational infeasibility of VaccineChain.

Key features of OCBS’ are their ability to improve scalability, reduce data storage requirements, and enhance data privacy, all extremely critical issues to enable broader blockchain adoption. These OCBS features map well to the needs of the healthcare industry, particularly due to the need to manage various types of medical, consumer, and other health-related data. However, different types of health data are also subject to stringent regulatory, security and legal requirements, a key factor limiting blockchain adoption in the sector. In response, there is a critical need to better align OCBS design features to different types of healthcare data management and their respective governance and privacy regimes. This article first reviews the characteristics of different constructs of OCBS. It then proposes a modular hybrid privacy-preserving framework leveraging off-chain and on-chain blockchain system design applied to three different reference models that illustrate how blockchain can enhance healthcare information management. Through this privacy-preserving framework we hope to liberate healthcare data by enabling sharing, sovereignty and enhanced trust.},

This is because blockchain technology is built on trust and cannot be changed. The popularity of blockchain technology is increasing as it is trustworthy and cannot be changed; hence making traceability easier for information such as where food came from, thus essential for managing the agricultural food supply chain (SC). On the contrary, suggested SCM systems premised on smart contract technology and blockchain tend to be specifically apply to production and production processes. Through qualitative research, this paper suggests framework for adoption of smart contracts based on Ethereum in the agri-food SC, with the aim to establish means to adopt blockchain for checking food quality and origins in the agri-food supply chain. Remix IDE is utilised to build and test the smart contract. The significance of the framework is realised through ensuring the traceability of product safety and quality.},

The results revealed that user empowerment was the most significant factor influencing acceptance. Furthermore, multigroup analysis (MGA) demonstrates how different contexts have distinct acceptance predictors. Depending on the context, perceived lower fees, perceived faster settlement, perceived income distribution, perceived fraudproof, and perceived traceability had varying significance. Meanwhile, perceived immutability, perceived process automation, and perceived transparency, even though considered appealing, were not significant in influencing acceptance. The findings imply that stakeholders should balance technicality and behavioural aspects, and be aware of the context.},

Web3 describes a broad range of emerging internet applications for blockchain technology (i.e., a decentralized, public database that allows information to be securely recorded on a network of computers rather than verified and controlled by centralized entities). Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices. We conclude by addressing how established companies can prepare for a more decentralized internet.},

 abstract = {Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been produced on a large scale since 2020. However, large-scale vaccine production has led to two forms of waste; namely, overproduction and underutilization. Most of today’s systems and technologies used to manage waste data related to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of providing transparency, traceability, accountability, trust, and security features. In this paper, we address the problem of COVID-19 vaccines waste due to their overproduction and underutilization. We propose a blockchain-based solution that is composed of five phases: registration, commitment; production and delivery; consumption; and waste assessment. These phases make up the complete life cycle of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are governed by several smart contracts to ensure accountability of all the actions taken by the involved entities and reduce any excessive waste caused by overproduction, overordering, or underconsumption. We ensure security, traceability, and data provenance by recording all actions through smart contracts in the form of events on an immutable ledger. We utilize decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the costs posed by large-sized file storage when stored on-chain. We present algorithms that describe the logic behind our developed smart contracts. We test and validate the functionalities of our proposed solution. We conduct security, cost, and scalability analyses to show that our solution is affordable, scalable, and secure. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain-based solutions to show its novelty and superiority. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.},

 abstract = {Crowdfunding is a fundraising method that involves raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically through online platforms. It allows individuals, businesses, or organizations to present their projects, ideas, or causes to a global audience and request financial support from a crowd of potential backers. Crowdfunding has gained popularity across various industries, including technology, arts, entrepreneurship, social causes, and more. It provides a democratized approach to financing, allowing innovative and creative ideas to come to life with the support of a diverse community of backers. The current research explores the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts to revolutionize traditional crowdfunding methodologies. Traditional crowdfunding has been plagued by issues such as lack of transparency, centralized intermediaries, slow payment processing, fraud, and limited access. In response to these challenges, blockchain solutions offer a transparent and decentralized approach, allowing contributors to track their contributions, eliminate intermediaries, automate fund disbursement, and enable cross-border transactions. Tokenization and reduced entry barriers further enhance accessibility and participation. The current research presents a conceptual model and implementation of a smart contract-based crowdfunding system using Solidity, addressing these issues and providing a foundation for future research in the field of decentralized crowdfunding. The research scope has been expanded to encompass Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a means of fundraising for startups. Within this context, fungible tokens, which adhere to the ERC-20 standard, are generated using the OpenZeppelin library. These tokens are then subject to approval by the startup, granting authorization to a crowdfunding manager for the purpose of distributing tokens to contributors based on their respective contributions. The percentage of tokens made available for distribution can be customized to suit the specific needs and preferences of the startup.},

 abstract = {With the rapid growth of big data, the applications of intellectual property (IP) rights and prior art documents are increasing rapidly. Patent examiners are usually overworked to evaluate inventions referring to a large volume of prior arts in a short period. Such increasing workloads and documents may cause administrative inefficiencies and generate low-quality IPs that hamper technological innovation. Moreover, today's centralized IP administration system is inefficient in processing speed, security, and cost. Inefficiencies of IP administration in each national IP office impede speedy and efficient cooperation for international application and registration. This study proposes an IP decentralized ledger (IP dLedger) based on the blockchain to significantly reduce IP administration costs and improve IP use. IP dLedger connects the on-chain (blockchain) to the off-chain (centralized database) systems using IP codes that combine hash values and timestamps. Similar to the web hypertext method, this connective feature of IP dLedger enables users who click on identification information registered in a blockchain network to access, through a hyperlink, a centralized database of enormous volumes of related IP information. Therefore, IP dLedger can reduce IP administration costs, increase IP usage, and facilitate safe and convenient use of the IP data.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, the vast majority of Internet services used to distribute hypermedia content follow a centralized model, which is highly dependent on servers and raises several quality and security concerns. Among other issues, this centralized model creates single points of failure, requires trust on providers to avoid censorship and personal data misuse, and results in a scenario where digital content tends to disappear or be inaccessible over time, for example, when a content creator stops maintaining a site or when the content is moved to another location. To improve this, it is necessary to replicate data and follow more distributed models. Nevertheless, current platforms to distribute content in this way, either do not offer an effective mechanism to maintain the privacy of their users or they offer full-anonymity, which contributes to the dissemination of content that goes beyond the law and moral standards of many users. This paper proposes a novel distributed architecture that enables hypermedia resource distribution ensuring censorship resistance and conditional k-anonymity. In the proposed system, users form groups to share hypermedia content where the anonymity of the publisher is preserved only if the publication follows a set of rules defined by the group. To this end, the proposed system uses threshold discernible ring signatures to enable conditional k-anonymity, the Ethereum blockchain platform to manage groups and user identities, and the InterPlanetary File System to store and share hypermedia resources in a distributed way. This document provides the design for the proposed architecture and protocols, it evaluates system risks and its security properties, and it discusses the proposal in general terms.},

 abstract = {Data sharing has received much attention and research as an excellent way to unlock the value of data. Trusted data storage servers will participate in the data-sharing system to provide users with convenient data access and storage services. Currently, the vast majority of researchers design data-sharing systems based on centralized trusted authorities and key management centers, but they tend to ignore the problems of trust dependency and data leakage that exist in centralized trust and lead to the overall untrustworthiness of the system. To solve the above problems, this paper considers the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) to provide trusted authentication for data-sharing entities, but the traditional PKI has CA root trust and scenario adaptation problems, so we optimize the traditional PKI model for data-sharing scenarios and call it an improved PKI. Combining the decentralized trust property of blockchain, this paper proposes a TDS-NA scheme based on blockchain and improved PKI to build a distributed trusted, and secure data-sharing system in a semi-trusted network environment. TDS-NA can secure shared data in data sharing, and provide digital certificates that support entity-trusted authentication and reliable access control while designing digest blocks for efficient data auditing. In this paper, we demonstrate that the TDS-NA scheme is able to resist man-in-the-middle attacks and certificate forgery attacks through formal security analysis while satisfying the necessary security properties of data-sharing systems. We implement a prototype of the TDS-NA scheme in ethereum smart contracts and finally verify the security and feasibility of TDS-NA through experimental comparison and analysis.},

Our framework supports two surveillance modes, namely, medical federation surveillance based on federated learning and social collaboration surveillance based on the learning markets approach, and fuses their monitoring results on emerging cases to alert. By using our framework, medical institutions are expected to obtain better federated surveillance models with privacy protection, and social participants without mutual trusts can also share verified surveillance resources such as data and models, and fuse their surveillance solutions. We implemented our proposed framework based on the Ethereum and IPFS platforms. Experimental results show that our framework has advantages of decentralized decision-making, fairness, auditability, and universality.

Since these special SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks have different characteristics from the widely studied SCs designed for business logic, we name them Intelligent Contracts (ICs) for a focused study. In this paper, we systematically analyze ICs and propose a constructive framework for their construction and application. Specifically, we first formulate two construction modes of current ICs, including encoding AI models and scheduling AI collaboration. Then, we compare the characteristics of these two modes theoretically and experimentally as a reference for future mode selection. Finally, to extend the application of ICs and encourage AI-driven blockchain intelligence, we propose a technical route that helps blockchain autonomously respond to AI tasks through the dynamic and optimal configuration of ICs. Using typical AI tasks of classifying IRIS, MNIST, and ImageNet data sets as examples, we implement and thoroughly evaluate two modes of ICs on Ethereum. Based on the constructed ICs, we illustrate their optimal configuration and automatic response process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.},

The choice of trust metric will depend on context, circumstance and user requirements and there is no single best metric for use in all circumstances. Where different users require different trust metrics to be employed the trust score calculations should still be based on all available trust evidence. Trust is normally computed using past experiences but, in practice (especially in centralised systems), the validity and accuracy of these experiences are taken for granted. In this paper, we provide a formal framework and practical blockchain-based implementation that allows independent trust providers to implement different trust metrics in a distributed manner while still allowing all trust providers to base their calculations on a common set of trust evidence. Further, our design allows experiences to be provably linked to interactions without the need for a central authority. This leads to the notion of evidence-based trust with provable interactions. Leveraging blockchain allows the trust providers to offer their services in a competitive manner, charging fees while users are provided with payments for recording experiences.

 abstract = {Multi-Agent systems technology can offer valuable tools to develop applications in domains involving transactions of assets. However, they usually do not have a proper support for reliable and decentralized recording of the transactions that are common in this kind of system. This support can be provided by the Blockchain technology. Furthermore, it is important to have means to represent in the system concepts that are intangible, such as asset and ownership. This paper presents a model of integration between Multi-Agent Systems and Blockchain where an artificial institution connects the intangible concepts related to transactions of assets to the concrete elements composing the system. An application example illustrates an implementation following the proposed integration model, showing its advantages and limitations. In the example, agents contract each other to provide services upon the payment of a dealt value through a system based on cryptocurrencies and blockchain. It highlights the essential contributions of the proposed approach to systems where agents transact assets: regulation of the system, representation of the notion of asset that does not depend on agents, and reliable recording of transactions based on Blockchain.},

 abstract = {Road accidents and traffic congestion severely impact road safety, resulting in significant loss of life and property. Therefore, there is a need for road safety and traffic management. The wireless networks of connected vehicles called Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) are designed to improve the traffic management on highways with comfort and safety for drivers and passengers. However, there is a need to develop an authentication scheme that can protect the privacy of vehicles and secure them against attacks such as insider attacks and repudiation attacks. In this article, we present a scheme that performs vehicle registration and message forwarding in the VANETs and appends the transactions to the blockchain. The proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme using blockchain technology enables vehicles and Trusted Authorities (TA) to authenticate vehicles while preserving privacy. The proposed scheme facilitates privacy-preserving authentication by deploying the scheme on a decentralized network. The proposed scheme ensures privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and transparency during vehicle authentication for VANETs. In the proposed scheme, an authentication process is automated with the use of a smart contract. We comparatively evaluate the security and performance of the proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme with the state-of-the-art literature. The proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme is significantly reliable and transparent in authenticating vehicles while preserving privacy.},

 abstract = {Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm which expands cloud-based computing services near the network edge. With this new computing paradigm, new challenges arise in terms of security and privacy. These concerns are due to the distributed ownership of Fog devices. Because of the large scale distributed nature of devices at the Fog layer, secure authentication for communication among these devices is a major challenge. The traditional authentication methods (password-based, certificate-based and biometric-based) are not directly applicable due to the unique architecture and characteristics of the Fog. Moreover, the traditional authentication methods consume significantly more computation power and incur high latency, and this does not meet the key requirements of the Fog. To fill this gap, this article proposes a secure decentralised location-based device to device (D2D) authentication model in which Fog devices can mutually authenticate each other at the Fog layer by using Blockchain. We considered an Ethereum Blockchain platform for the Fog device registration, authentication, attestation and data storage. We presented the overall system architecture, various participants and their transactions and message interaction between the participants. We validated the proposed model by comparing it with the existing method; results showed that the proposed authentication mechanism was efficient and secure. From the performance evaluation, it was found that the proposed method is computationally efficient and secure in a highly distributed Fog network.},

 abstract = {Consent is one of six legal bases for personal data processing mentioned in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is a privacy law giving European Union (EU) citizens authority over personal data. It enforces software systems to collect, analyze, and share only necessary information (‘data minimization’) following the specific purpose (‘consent’). The GDPR defines consent as permission of individuals (‘data subjects’) to give organizations (‘data controllers’) processing their personal data. Without a data subject's consent, the data controller processes personal data unlawfully. Therefore, consent management is an essential component of a software system to build data subjects' trust and engagement. However, sharing data can lead to a potential loss of control over personal data, as data are across boundaries between software services. One of the significant risks is caused by a lack of developers' experience in data protection practices. Hence, in this paper, we propose to use blockchain technology to manage data subjects' informed consent for data sharing to build trust, transparency, and traceability to share data across software services. We formalized the semantics of smart contracts to extend the blockchain features to validate the consent authorization and manage the request-response interaction between the services. Furthermore, we used the Event-B method to describe the dynamic behavior of the proposed model and prove its correctness. Finally, we provided a mapping from the formal model to a smart contract class diagram and a prototype called SmartDataTrust implemented with solidity and Python REST API that developers can easily utilize.},

Secure logging of incident related data is important in case of accidents for forensic analysis, insurance, and legal settlements. Internet of vehicles can be enhanced using machine learning techniques to detect events automatically at the vehicle and road infrastructure level and blockchain can be used as a source for immutable evidence storage and management. The work proposes a framework addressing multiple challenges in traffic incident detection and evidence management like gathering of traffic event related evidence from multiple sources, addressing fault management in embedded vehicle on board units, resiliency from malicious event reporting and handling conflicting traffic incident event reports. The framework relies on a combination of cooperative event correlation and trust model to detect malicious and erroneous reporting of traffic incidents followed by Long Short term Memory (LSTM) and Bayesian model to resolve conflicting event reports. The events are correlated and verified before being transmitting onto the blockchain for evidence management and access control by various stakeholders. Analysis is presented highlighting the improvement in efficiency achieved by convergence of the multiple approaches proposed.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in today’s Internet introduced huge demand for End-to-End Quality of Service (E2E QoS) assurances for delivering different types of traffic (video, live streaming, and telemedicine), originating from a wide spectrum of applications. Such applications stretch across multiple administrative domains and require fair and robust coordination for E2E QoS provisioning. While the selection of trusted domains is of paramount importance for the successful realization of E2E QoS, the issue of domain’s trust while finding E2E QoS paths has not been actively explored in the existing works. Trust awareness reduces the risk of violating QoS and improves the confidence of operating QoS across multiple domains. However, identifying trusted domains, finding the source of trust, and quantifying trust are the major challenges for enabling trust aware E2E QoS routing. Auditability of QoS implementation results at each domain forms a vital source for verifying QoS compliance and subsequently evaluating the trust of the domain. However, securely obtaining logs from the domains and identifying the accountability of domains for E2E QoS, without relying on a third party introduces significant difficulty when evaluating domain trust with respect to QoS compliance. This work proposes Trust aware E2E QoS Routing (TRAQR) framework for provisioning E2E QoS with trust and verifying the QoS compliance in Multi-Domain Software Defined Networks (MD-SDN). TRAQR efficiently leverages the tamper-proof and decentralized properties of Blockchain to store and exchange different kinds of trust information required to provision and verify E2E QoS compliance of the domains. This work developed a proof of concept implementation of the TRAQR in an MD-SDN environment emulated using Mininet, RYU SDN controller, Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to demonstrate the performance and benefits of TRAQR. Further, the simulations showed that the domain trust parameter introduced significant improvement in QoS compliance, even in the presence of untrusted domains.},

 abstract = {Protecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.},

 abstract = {Attaining “Common Knowledge” is essential in the formation of deals and agreements, but is hard to achieve over point-to-point communication networks such as the Internet. While blockchain technologies provide a helpful mechanism in the form of technical consensus, originally created to resolve the double-spending problem, little does it address impediments to proper contract formation that have to do with the quality of exogenous data, asymmetry of information, or even its suitability (the colloquial garbage-in/garbage-out problem). In the face of the limitations of technical consensus, we explore how the strengths of technical consensus can be utilized by introducing another dimension of consensus – what we have called social consensus – which directly addresses the formation of true (if retrospective) Common Knowledge essential to arms-length agreement between multiple actors. We have eschewed the notion that social consensus as an epistemological concern, and instead focus on mechanisms by which environments of multiple actors form and sustain bodies of information that enable them to go about their activities with a reasonable level of confidence that others in the supply chain will ‘do their bit,’ backed by a ‘failsafe’ mechanism enforced by cryptography which holds the actors unharmed in case the envisioned finality is not obtained. These bodies of information create what is essentially a retrospective form of common knowledge, and a lesser variant, mutual knowledge. We propose an implementation from the preferred mechanism of a multisig primitive, which builds and improves on the Gnosis multisig, in the use case of decentralized blockchain-powered supply chains consisting of multiple parties, human and machine.},

This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic –the smart contracts– and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.},

 abstract = {The exponential growth of the use of insecure stationary and portable devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) network of the smart city has made the security of the smart city against cyber-attacks a vital issue. Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the “single point of failure” problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time.},

 abstract = {Diabetes poses a global health challenge, demanding continuous monitoring and expert care for effective management. Conventional monitoring methods lack real-time insights and secure data-sharing capabilities, necessitating innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.},

Indeed, many blockchain use cases are being developed today in different areas. Due to the complexity of certain processes, a new technology associated to blockchain has appeared – smart contracts. These digital contracts act like traditional contracts, with the major difference being their automaticity.

 abstract = {With the increasing integration of distributed generators and the rapid development of electricity markets, active distribution networks (ADNs) confront new challenges in operation optimization. Centralized optimization methods usually aggravate the computational burden when applied to large-scale distribution networks (DNs). A distributed operation optimization model incorporating peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading in a blockchain environment is proposed in this paper, where network usage fees considering electrical distance are specially addressed. Meanwhile, the private information security of prosumers is ensured by the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus blockchain during P2P electricity trading. The trading information of adjustable prosumers should be sent to the proxy entity authorized by the DN using the blockchain platform. In addition, a network partitioning method via dynamic reconfiguration considering multi-level switching is offered to adapt to the required distributed manner. The operation network, as well as the corresponding market structure can be automatically updated according to the results of dynamic reconfiguration. Moreover, the unit price of network usage fees can be adjusted to derive a higher amount of P2P electricity trading with security constraints. Case studies on a practical 148-bus system and a 297-bus system verify that the proposed model maximizes the profits and reduces the computational time in the distributed operation optimization.},

 abstract = {Climate change is a major issue that has disastrous implications on the environment, which, if continued, will cause severe consequences. One of the leading causes of climate change is the emissions of harmful gases, particularly CO2. In 1997, the Kyoto protocol was signed by 192 countries, creating a system that monetizes CO2 emissions with an aim to control them. Most countries signed a carbon trading scheme, but the scheme fell short of its goals due to manipulation, lack of integrity, and multiple other challenges. This work presents an improved blockchain-based approach to achieve the objective of monitoring the reduction of carbon emissions. Blockchain's distinct features such as security, immutability, transparency, traceability, and trust, make it a robust and reliable solution for the carbon trading market. Previous Blockchain-based proposals were not comprehensive, practical, applicable, or efficient enough to form an effective solution. This research addresses the current gaps and proposes a comprehensive three-stage hierarchical blockchain framework that employs smart contracts in Blockchain of Things (BoT) to ensure integrity in the system and reach fair trade status that favors the environment over companies' cost reductions and profit-making. The result is an optimized carbon emission trading framework, fully transparent with automated trading and control mechanisms.},

However, transactive energy implementation in power systems has several challenges such as data privacy and security. In existing researches, energy trading mechanisms rely on central authorities, where security and privacy cannot be maintained. Therefore, this paper presents a decentralized stochastic optimization model of transactive energy management based on blockchain in the presence of CES. In this framework, the smart contract based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers technique is deployed on the Ganache and Ethereum blockchains, and the YALMIP toolbox along with CPLEX solver handle decentralized optimization in the MATLAB software.

 abstract = {We consider multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with the popular paradigm of centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). CTDE empowers sharing knowledge from agents in different environments for updating a shared model. A wide range of applications is supported through CTDE in MARL, such as self-driving vehicle coordination, traffic lights synchronization, or cooperation in various aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT), including resource management. Despite the drawbacks of relying on a central authority for handling model updates, incorporating multiple sources of data raises concerns about the trustworthiness of the process. For instance, participating agents could provide data in the favor of their experiences to shift the model towards certain behaviors. Similarly, sending falsified data for updates could lead to adversarial attacks. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to integrate the Ethereum Blockchain technology to handle model updates in the CTDE paradigm by achieving decentralized storage and consensus mechanism for model updates. In the literature, there exist multiple efforts that propose using reinforcement learning (RL) on Blockchain; however, none of them have considered updating MARL of CTDE on-chain, allowing transparent and auditable record of the training process. Therefore, we propose LearnChain, a framework that offers an integration between the CTDE mechanism and a Consortium Blockchain built between authorized participants, thus avoiding gas costs. At the core of LearnChain, RL is integrated with Quorum, offering separate smart contracts for deployment, data handling with incentive mechanisms, training, target update, and inference. Based on a real use-case entailing management of Vehicular Edge Computing tasks through multi-agent synchronization, we implement LearnChain and evaluate its performance and cost in different settings.

The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46% uniqueness and 2.38% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.},

Recent events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted, in particular, the role of trust in effective public policy making and consumer behavioural change. Here we propose a hybrid blockchain solution called a Polkadot parachain. Polkadot is a blockchain technology that connects a network of blockchains, each called a parachain, that can be customised to the business needs of a given application. This solution provides the cost benefits, scalability, and control of a permissioned or private blockchain while providing the security, verifiability, and trust of a public blockchain. The solution is developed with a design science approach and combines three typically separate blockchain use cases: supply chain tracking, incentivisation through a payment system, and gamification to achieve a complete solution for waste management. We provide a detailed discussion on the design of this blockchain solution with the use of blockchain functionality assessed against the criteria and development approaches found in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how such a blockchain can be implemented with the Substrate blockchain development framework.},

Several test cases were identified and have been used to verify the functionality of the framework and the Proof-of-Concept.},

 abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge allows cloud computing services for topology and location-sensitive distributed computing. As an immediate benefit, it improves network reliability and latency by enabling data access and processing rapidly and efficiently near IoT devices. However, it comes with several issues stemming from the complexity, the security, the energy consumption, and the instability due to the decentralization of service localization. Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward. Blockchain has been envisioned to enforce trustworthiness in diverse IoT environments. However, high latency and high energy costs are incurred to process IoT transactions. This paper introduces a novel Blockchain-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to enable energy-aware task scheduling and offloading in an Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT network. The Asynchronous Actor–Critic Agent (A3C) DRL-based policy achieves efficient task scheduling and offloading. The latter is in symbiosis with Proof-of-Authority Blockchain consensus to validate IoT transactions and blocks. By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically. Carried out experiments put forth that our approach offers 50% better energy efficiency, which outperforms traditional consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work and PBFT, in terms of throughput and network latency and offers better scheduling performance.},

 abstract = {Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).},

Also, relying on third parties to trade in centralized systems is indispensable. Although current exist frameworks for these solutions in the supply chain, these have work poor traceability and lack of real-time information, and especially lack of privacy. In this article, we propose a framework for supply chain traceability that preserves privacy from third parties by using smart contracts. In the proposed framework, digital signature and verification are provided by using existing cryptographic techniques in off-chain and on-chain smart contract integration, and it is demonstrated the applicability of architecture by testing. The architecture also provides both anonymity and traceability depending on the user’s request. Finally, thanks to traceability and auditability in the proposed system, customers and other parties can view with a single product ID and also verify with digital signature the claims of the actors in the system.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition, the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food, medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification, and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability, and security. In addition, new challenges regarding security and privacy have emerged in the system as the ever-growing smart connected IoT devices generate a significant amount of heterogeneous data. Given these challenges, in this paper, we propose PPFchain, a new federated learning-enabled blockchain-based framework to ensure the security and privacy of sensor-IoT-based architectures using sampled ECS data. PPFchain has a lightweight, low-cost, high-performance architecture in the IoT-based blockchain network. In the architecture, we used the federated model and cryptographic primitives for user and data privacy in off-chain fog nodes considering performance. Moreover, we compared with traditional blockchain models using various performance metrics for system performance in a distributed architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract. In addition, the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced security.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) paved the way to realize ubiquitous access towards manifold services and applications by enabling connectivity between different physical devices. The devices, having heterogeneous computation power, protocol stack, or storage power, can send or receive various services by communicating through the internet. These services inevitably demand a secure and reliable network system to interchange the data or information for their impressive utilization. One proven solution to attain this objective is embedding Trust Management System (TMS) that aims to reduce risk or uncertainty associated with interacting adversary devices by capturing their dynamic behavior in the system. With TMS, devices compute and maintain trust value on the interacting devices by observing their behavior with different interaction instances. This trust information is exchanged between the devices to assess the global reputation of devices and facilitate devices’ decisions when there is a lack of direct interactions. For systems having enormous low-power devices, one crucial aspect of TMS is secure and timely dissemination, management, and storage of trust information to accurately assess devices’ dynamic behavior. Addressing this issue, we present a blockchain-assisted scalable trust model, BLAST-IoT, for IoT systems of heterogeneous devices in this paper. BLAST-IoT intends to ensure secure dissemination and storage of trust information leveraging on the functionalities provided by blockchain technology. It adopts a semi-distributed approach where direct trust information, computed by IoT end devices, is processed and stored by some high-power edge devices running public blockchain networks to handle impediments caused by power-deficient IoT devices. The effectiveness of BLAST-IoT has been evaluated through implementation and simulation-based results for trust convergence and assessment accuracy in the dynamic IoT environment. Further, the throughput performance of BLAST-IoT has been examined with an increase in network load.},

 abstract = {In recent years, on the one hand, we have witnessed the rise of blockchain technology, which has led to better transparency, traceability, and therefore, trustworthy exchange of digital assets among different actors. On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.},

 abstract = {Many smart applications, including smart cities, healthcare, smart agriculture, manufacturing, etc., have widely adopted the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart Farming (SF) integrates a set of technologies, such as cloud and edge computing and greenhouse concepts, to improve agricultural processes. Due to its capacity to generate fresh agricultural products at an incredible pace of development and output, the greenhouse business has recently attracted the attention of the farming community. However, the cost of labor and energy consumption causes the greenhouse’s production cost to rise by roughly 40%–50%. To avoid this, SF concepts have been introduced. Data management in SF has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its high potential for more accurate and cost-effective agriculture. Traditional client–server and cloud-based data management systems are plagued by single faults, data protection, centralized data management, and system vulnerabilities. In this paper, an IoT-based framework is proposed for SF to improve the productivity of crops. AI-based precision model is introduced in the framework, which can be integrated with remote sensor data for correct prediction of crop growth in smart agriculture. The result shows that the random forest model works better with 97% accuracy compared to Support Vector Classifier (SVC) have 93%, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have 90%, and Logistic Regression 84%. This technology helps to reduce costs while also improving the overall quality of the agricultural process and product management with blockchain-based supply chain management to enhance farmers’ economic backdrop. The blockchain performance is evaluated on gas consumption, execution time, throughput and latency.},

The proposed system is based on Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus algorithm and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). We implemented the proposed system on an enterprise Ethereum Blockchain known as Hyperledger Besu. We evaluated and compared the performance of the proposed system based on various performance metrics such as transaction latency, throughput and failure rate. Experiments were conducted on a variable network size and number of transactions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than existing Blockchain based systems. Moreover, the decentralized file system provides better security than existing traditional centralized database systems while providing the same level of performance.},

Given the scarcity of understanding about the role of specific technologies enabling value creation through digital connectivity, we investigate how blockchain-based digital connectivity shapes value creation in international digital platforms and ecosystems (DPEs). Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity. Moreover, this interdisciplinary explanation reveals why certain features theoretically attributed to blockchain (e.g., decentralization, trust) do not always realize or support value creation in practice in IB based on the DPE business model.},

The models involve different tradeoffs in terms of cost, delay, complexity, and privacy, while exploiting key advantages of smart contracts and multiple blockchains that communicate with interledger mechanisms. These include immutably recording hashes of authorization information and policies in smart contracts, resilience through the execution of smart contract code on all blockchain nodes, and cryptographically linking transactions and IoT events recorded on different blockchains using hash-lock and time-lock mechanisms. In the case of two ledgers, an authorization and a payment ledger, the authorization ledger can be a private Ethereum network or a permissioned ledger such as Hyperledger Fabric. For decentralized authorization where a subset of m-out-of-n authorization servers are required, we present two policies for selecting the m servers. The first policy can utilize statistics of the authorization servers such as transaction cost and response time. The second policy selects the first m servers that respond. The proposed models are evaluated on the public Ethereum testnets Rinkeby and Ropsten, and for different implementations on the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned ledger, in terms of execution cost (gas), delay, and reduction of data that needs to be sent to the constrained IoT devices.},

However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet.

 abstract = {Blockchain and its related concept of decentral autonomous organization (DAO) is starting to influence project management. But how might project management supported by blockchain technology look like? And how would such a new form change and affect traditional project management? Not many concepts have been designed or even implemented yet. We chose an experimental framework to answer the first aspects of these questions. We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.},

 abstract = {Web3 is emerging as the new Internet-interaction model that facilitates direct collaboration between strangers without a need for prior trust between network participants and without central authorities. However, one of its shortcomings is the lack of a defense mechanism against the ability of a single user to generate a surplus of identities, known as the Sybil attack. Web3 has a Sybil attack problem because it uses peer sampling to establish connections between users. We evaluate the promising but under-explored direction of Sybil avoidance using network latency measurements, according to which two identities with equal latencies are suspected to be operated from the same node, and thus are likely Sybils. Network latency measurements have two desirable properties: they are only malleable by attackers by adding latency, and they do not require any trust between network participants. Our basic SybilSys mechanism avoids Sybil attackers using only network latency measurements if attackers do not actively exploit their malleability. We present an enhanced version of SybilSys that protects against targeted attacks using a variant of the flow correlation attack, which we name TrafficJamTrigger. We show how the message flows of Round-Trip Time measurements can be used to expose attack patterns and we propose and evaluate six classifiers to recognize these patterns. Our experiments show, through both emulation and real-world deployment, that enhanced SybilSys can serve a fundamental role for Web3, effectively establishing connections to real users even in the face of networks consisting of 99% Sybils.},

Building on the assumption that medical records are stored locally by the hospital, we use smart contracts to build a global encrypted search index and a verification index for multiple data owners on the blockchain. In our approach, fully functional access control is provided to ensure that patients and medical institutions can control access to the data. This allows the user to promptly verify the integrity of the results after the search.

 abstract = {The emergence of a data-driven society has sparked interest in data trading marketplaces. Traditional centralized marketplaces are unable to meet the needs of a transparent, safe, and privacy-protected data marketplace. To address the above challenges, we propose a data marketplace on blockchain with arbitration using side-contracts mechanisms (dMOBAs), in which a consortium of data owners, data buyers, and arbitrators collaborate to create an ecosystem in the blockchain’s witnesses. Our marketplace’s goals are to provide a decentralized platform for trading personal data for both service providers and data owners. In the meantime, the transaction method can be arbitrated. The arbitrators alliance, which is responsible for resolving data disputes, is formed by a service provider jointly nominated by the buyer and seller. The integrity and value of transacted data can be validated thanks to the arbitrators’ consortium. The side-contracts concept decreases the public chain’s overhead and enhances the marketplace’s operating efficiency. The marketplace’s orderly functioning is ensured by explicit incentives and rigorous arbitration methods. To demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the mechanisms, we implement dMOBAs on Ethereum, Fabric and IPFS platforms and analyze its performance. According to the testing results, our arbitration method is 2 times faster than full public chain-based arbitration.},

 abstract = {Scientific publishing systems (SPS) provides platforms to authors, reviewers, and editors to express research for the betterment of the community. Traditionally, the research databases are assigned electronic identifiers, and manuscripts are preserved in electronic form. Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.},

We develop a conceptual model and testable propositions that extend the work of McKnight et al. (2001, 2002, 2011) to the blockchain ecosystem based on an integrative literature review. We conceptualize trust as a multidimensional, multi-object construct combining three major objects of trust: algorithmic trust in the blockchain protocol (platform), trust towards peers and services providers, and trust in decentralized applications (product). The model reflects the process of building a trust layer for users and institutions on top of the trustless technology. The paper demystifies the trust building process, from initial trust to knowledge-based trust, and its dimensions within the blockchain ecosystem, and, consequently, helps practitioners to build strategies that increase users' trust.

 abstract = {The public’s health depends on a reliable drug supply chain. Recently, the number of drug counterfeit has increased drastically, resulting in thousands of victims suffering from poisoning and/or treatment failures, which have resulted in new expectations on drug supply chain traceability. Indeed, the drug supply chain involves many parties having heterogeneous interests and are usually reluctant to share traceability data with each other. Furthermore, existing traceability and provenance systems for drug supply chains suffer from separated data storage, lack of information sharing transparency, and trust. Decentralized blockchain-based solutions are advocated to address these limitations by realizing decentralized trustless systems. In this work, we present a fully decentralized, blockchain-based drug traceability solution, worthy of seamless integrating IoT devices throughout the chain. It uses both smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage to remove the need for middleman and to provide trusted, secure and immutable transaction history. Moreover, to preserve the traceability of drugs, it ensures and enforces data provenance and data integrity in the proposed IoT environment by using blockchain Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We give a test and validation of the approach’s effectiveness in enhancing drug traceability supply chains, as well as an analysis of the approach’s costs and security.},

 abstract = {The growing integration of distributed generations and battery storage equipped with smart meters paves a way to smartly manage the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) using a digital platform to improve the overall performance of the microgrid system. The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intra-trading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency “Cosmos (Atom)” is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism. The proposed design framework presented in this paper has addressed the implementation of an effective energy management platform for developing a self-sustained microgrid system using distributed energy resources.},

As a key element of scientific innovations, data sharing allows the reproduction of results and helps prevent data fabrication, falsification, and misuse. Although the research benefits from data reuse are widely acknowledged, the data collections existing today are still kept in silos. Indeed, monitoring what happens to data once they have been handed to a third party is currently not feasible within the current data sharing practices. We propose a blockchain-based system to trace data collections and potentially create a more trustworthy data sharing process. In this paper, we present the LUCE (License accoUntability and CompliancE) architecture as a decentralized blockchain-based platform supporting data sharing and reuse. LUCE is designed to provide full transparency on what happens to the data after they are shared with third parties. The contributions of this work consist of i) the design of a decentralized data sharing solution with accountability and compliance by design and ii) the inclusion of a dynamic consent model for personalized data sharing preferences and for enabling legal compliance mechanisms. We test the scalability of the platform in a real-time environment where a growing number of users access and reuse different datasets. Compared to existing data sharing solutions, LUCE provides transparency over data sharing practices, enables data reuse, and supports regulatory requirements. The experimentation shows that the platform can be scaled for a large number of users.},

 abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.},

 abstract = {In this paper, an integrated blockchain-based energy management platform is proposed that optimizes energy flows in a microgrid whilst implementing a bilateral trading mechanism. Physical constraints in the microgrid are respected by formulating an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, which is combined with a bilateral trading mechanism in a single optimization problem. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the problem to enable distributed optimization and a smart contract is used as a virtual aggregator. This eliminates the need for a third-party coordinating entity. The smart contract fulfills several functions, including distribution of data to all participants and executing part of the ADMM algorithm. The model is run using actual data from a prosumer community in Amsterdam and several scenarios of the model are tested to evaluate the impact of combining physical constraints and trading on social welfare of the community and scheduling of energy flows. The scenario variants are trade-only, where only a trading mechanism is implemented, grid-only where only OPF optimization is implemented and a combined scenario where both are implemented. Results are compared with a baseline scenario. Simulation results show that import costs of the whole community are reduced by 34.9% as compared to a baseline scenario, and total energy import quantities are reduced by 15%. Total social welfare is found to be highest without a trading mechanism, however this platform is only viable when all costs are equally shared between all households. Furthermore, peak imports are reduced by over 50% in scenarios including grid constraints.},

 abstract = {Collaboration of business processes is essential for business-to-business (B2B) processes. Collaboration is interesting and important in connecting the digital context with the physical world (IoT) to feed processes with data or send data. However, it also presents multiple challenges, such as the lack of trust between participants with each other and additional privacy and security problems in the communicated data. Fraud detection is crucial for many type of organisations that deal with B2B transactions (banking, fintech, health, etc.) and are therefore exposed to a high risk of fraud. Fraud detection requires expensive professional investigations and intensive collaboration between processes of different organisations. This issue could be mitigated by effectively managing digital evidence, fostering trust and ensuring security for various stakeholders involved in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach to modelling and deploying any collaborative business process scenario, ensuring trust, security, and data privacy. Collaboration-level agreements are defined as a means to ensure trust, security, and data privacy. To accomplish this, our approach enables the automatic generation Smart Contract templates for the collaboration-level agreement specification involving different stakeholders in the collaboration. The Smart contracts are deployed in a Blockchain to ensure that the collaboration-level agreement conditions are signed by the parties. To validate the feasibility of our approach, a proof-of-concept for a fraud detection scenario is implemented, where different metrics are tested in relation to a set of threats and vulnerabilities.},

 abstract = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as an emerging technology, has gained much attention in recent years due to rapid advancements in computing paradigms, vehicular and wireless technologies. IoV integrates vehicles with the internet using a computing paradigm and enables vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, the increase in density and the highly dynamic nature of vehicles have led to exponential complexity in traffic management, data exchange, and route scheduling. Moreover, rapid advancements in vehicular technologies to manage, store, and exchange data have led to serious security concerns. Software-defined networking (SDN), as an emerging networking architecture, has been adopted to control and manage the dynamic nature of vehicles and provide diverse quality of service and security (QoSS). These services include better transportation, resource sharing, network verification, and secure programmability of SDN-based applications. It consists of a centralized controller which uses OpenFlow (OF) protocol and achieves a global view of all the devices in a domain area. However, the network is vulnerable to single point of failure (SPoF), network topology poisoning, denial of service attacks, etc. To counter these attacks, a distributed control plane architecture has been adopted. However, it brings many challenges, and one of the biggest challenges is achieving consensus on information exchange among the controllers controlling different domain areas. Therefore, adopting blockchain technology in SDN-based vehicular network (SDVN) is a viable solution to address the mentioned challenges. The inherent features of blockchain such as decentralization, trust-free, immutability, public auditing and consensus algorithms offer various security services to vehicular networks. Therefore, this survey focuses on different SDN control plane architectures, security services, and challenges in SDVNs. The state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes focusing on security requirements in vehicular networks have been discussed. A summary of blockchain-based SDVNs have been presented. An analysis of SDN controllers, simulation tools, and blockchain platforms for Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) is made. Finally, future research issues, challenges, and lessons learnt have been discussed.},

 abstract = {The deregulation and decentralization of the energy market have resulted in a proliferation of distributed generation that participates in energy trading as prosumers. In peer-to-peer (P2P) trading of energy within the microgrid (MG), the peers can trade energy without the need for an intermediary. Blockchain technology is devised to assure the security and resilience of the system's P2P trading against adversarial attacks. The large number of renewable prosumers who participate in trading raises the MG system's oscillation frequency. To regulate the system frequency during trading, a distributed-based federated learned fractional-order recurrent neural network (FL-FORNN) adaptive controller is proposed. The control system is a crucial component of MGs in order to ensure stable performance. To aggregate the network weights, the proposed FL-based controller frequently communicates with the cloud server. To avoid the privacy threat during this case, we further propose to integrate FL with local differential privacy (LDP) to secure against the false data injection attack from the eavesdropper. To validate, the MG model is implemented in OPAL-RT with its resilient controller. The P2P trading of energy in the blockchain is executed in Raspberry Pis (RPis) based on the numerous prosumers/consumers participating in the trading. Then, the power information from the tertiary control implemented in RPis is communicated with the MG secondary frequency controller by interfacing using the user datagram protocol. The proposed work is realized for the MG considering four prosumers and three consumers, and the resiliency of the controller is authenticated with case studies. The results divulge that the LDP of the proposed controller can provide a robust and secure solution of MGs with P2P trading, even in the presence of adversarial attacks.},

 abstract = {In digitization, judicial investigations have transitioned towards digital storage of forensic shreds of evidence as electronic law records (ELRs). The shift poses varied challenges of ELR preservation, homogeneity of case formats, chronology in recorded statements by suspects, time-stamping and digital signatures on ELRs, and the chain of transfer of cases to different law enforcement agencies (LEAs) over open channels. Thus, privacy and trust among judicial stakeholders-case appellant (CA), case defendant (CD), the police officer (PO), defence lawyer (DL), prosecutor lawyers (PL), LEAs, and court judge is a prime concern. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, the paper presents a blockchain (BC)-based ELR management scheme, NyaYa, that operates as a four-phased scheme of judicial stakeholder registration in BC, case registration with meta-hash keys in public BC, that reference an external off-chain interplanetary file storage (IPFS), chronology of investigative updates among LEAs, and case hearing and settlement through smart contracts (SCs). In the simulation, NyaYa is compared to traditional ELR storage schemes for parameters like mining cost, query fetching time, block processing time, obtained IPFS throughput, signing latency, the effect of collusion attacks, ELR processing time, and corrupted indexes in IPFS. We also presented formal verification and proposed functionalities of SCs. In simulation, at 6 USD mining cost, NyaYa can append 22456 transactions, compared to 21497 and 3000 transactions respectively in existing schemes. The achieved query fetching time is 0.852 milli-seconds (ms), at 25 blocks, with cache support of 32 kilobyte (KB). The scheme has an average signing latency of 622.95ms, and achieves a high-trust probability of 0.887 %, compared to 0.765 % in consortium BC, and 0.455 % in private BC, at 500, colluding nodes. An improvement of 6.77 % is achieved in ELR uploading latency, and the scheme has only 21 corrupted IPFS indexes for 350 fetched ELRs. The obtained results indicate the efficacy of the proposed scheme against conventional schemes.},

Integrating blockchain technology into decentralized FL frameworks is critical to establishing the trust necessary for user participation. However, existing FL systems using blockchain often struggle with scalability, latency, and privacy issues, particularly in permissionless blockchain contexts. This paper proposes OpenFL, a novel, collateral-backed reputation system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This system aims to foster trust among participants in a decentralized FL environment. We present a fully autonomous smart contract platform specifically tailored to facilitate FL processes among anonymous users. Furthermore, we address potential security concerns by detailing our strategies to mitigate various attack vectors. To validate our system’s efficacy, we conducted experiments on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our findings demonstrate OpenFL’s capability to overcome the inherent limitations of permissionless blockchains while highlighting the significance of open-access protocols in this context. OpenFL can potentially broaden the participant base in trust-sensitive applications by reducing entry barriers, thus substantially contributing to decentralized machine learning.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology is widely used in the field of digital currency because of its non-tamperability, traceability, and decentralization. Blockchain’s private key is usually used to prove the ownership of the cryptocurrency. However, this private key managed by the blockchain wallet faces the challenge of secure storage. Once the private key is leaked or stolen, the user’s digital assets will be permanently lost. To solve the storage issue of the private key, we propose a novel approach based on facial biometrics and a physical unclonable function (PUF) device to generate a secure blockchain’s private key. Firstly, to protect user anonymity and enhance the security of the private key, a user’s facial biometrics is bound with a device’s PUF fingerprint to generate the trusted private keys online without being stored in a third-party server or an external device. Secondly, to prevent the leakage of sensitive data, we utilize the correctness and perfectness of secret sharing to protect the helper data to prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive information about the fusion template. Thirdly, we give the formal security proof of our proposed scheme and conduct the informal security analysis. The experiment results demonstrate our scheme achieves a better EER (Equal Error Rate) of 2.02% in terms of accuracy and takes about 1008ms to generate a private key in terms of efficiency. Moreover, our scheme can resist various attacks such as password guessing, stolen mobile device, user impersonation, physical and cloning, and information leakage attacks. Finally, we develop a blockchain wallet prototype without modifying the blockchain protocol to achieve transfer transactions for demonstrating the usability and security of our proposed approach in a real-world scenario.},

In this paper, we harmonize functional encryption and blockchain to propose a reliable and privacy-aware access control system named R-PAC. It allows a result-form access without learning raw information and fair interaction against malicious users. With a combination of all-or-nothing encapsulation technology, R-PAC supports users’ dynamic joining and key leakage resistance. We design R-PAC from Boneh–Franklin identity-based encryption, with forward-coverable encryption and reverse-discoverable decryption, and formally prove its indistinguishability security. We implement a R-PAC prototype and deploy it to a simulated Ethereum network to evaluate its performance. Experiments from both data access and transaction overhead show that R-PAC is with reasonable cost and has a trade-off between efficiency and strong security/functionality.},

However, existing centralized MCS applications that use servers for task publishing and data collection exhibit common problems, such as single points of failure and security vulnerabilities. Accordingly, we proposed a hybrid blockchain-based identity authentication scheme for MCS called HBIA, which uses blockchain technology to resolve the single-point failure problem. HBIA builds a cluster structure based on factors such as geographical location and balance, and uses it to construct a hybrid blockchain, with the cluster head node and internal cluster node authenticating on the public and private chains, respectively. We also implemented zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to ensure the privacy of participants’ identities, thus balancing the contradiction between blockchain transparency and security. In addition, HBIA uses the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) technology to enable off-chain computing and on-chain verification, further reducing the blockchain’s workload. Finally,​ HBIA was evaluated based on the pavement crack detection task and tested on the Ethereum public test network known as Ropsten.

In order to solve the above problems, this paper combines blockchain technology and game theory technology to propose a high-efficiency data sharing incentive method based on the Stackelberg game. Specifically, We first take the SF as the leader and the IME as the follower, and we define the data sharing incentive problem among SFs as the master–slave game problem. Then, the lower game problem and the upper game problem are solved, respectively, and finally the Nash equilibrium is derived. Then, a high-efficiency data sharing incentive method based on the Stackelberg game is designed and implemented. Finally, we conducted simulation experiments on the method proposed in this paper. Through theoretical and simulation experiments, it has been proven that the proposed method effectively reduces the impact of the selfishness of SFs and IME and improves the efficiency of data sharing among SFs.},

A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked.},

It is necessary to provide sustainable, cost-effective, resilient and scalable energy solutions to exploit the power of citizens to contribute to the clean energy transition, increasing the flexibility of the overall energy system. Energy community, as the new actor, create an integrated pan energy market by bringing together the local consumers and energy market players. However, diversity of energy community brings huge challenges in integration of decentralized renewables with regulated framework, interaction of decentralized marketplaces, as well as interoperability of the cross-border energy sectors with privacy, security and incentives. This paper intends to provide an in-depth investigation on the role of microgrid and blockchain, alone and together, in facilitating the energy community as the “enabling framework” to boost the potential solutions of electrification in the transportation, building, and industrial sectors, as well as rural/remote areas and islands towards a networking green ecosystem. This paper serves as a comprehensive reference to understand the modern microgrid on its control and communication technology with integration of blockchain services in promoting the techno-socio-economic innovations for the restructuring of the sustainable energy supply chain.},

 abstract = {Prefabricated construction has become one of the most innovative methods to address the pressing housing demands. However, conventional prefabricated construction projects often suffer from challenges of managing numerous paper-based documentation, non-standardized management and intricate stakeholders in construction site management (CSM). The current design approaches lack sufficient consideration of the activity-based user relationships. To facilitate the system framework design and implementation for CSM, this study proposes a generic Cyber-physical Centered (CCD) Design, illustrating an effective and systematic approach to identify user-activity relationships in a cross-collaborative context. The consideration of entity, value chain and user-activity relationships facilitate identity management and value chain management services. The proposed approach was then utilized to a pilot project to design and implement the Blockchain-enabled Cyber-physical Site Management System (BCSMS) integrated with Digital Work Supervision System (DWSS), incorporating considerations on multi-source information flow and user-centric applications design. The implemented BCSMS decentralized two types of fundamental documents in CSM - Request for Inspection and Survey Checking (RISC) form and site diary. It addresses information fragmentation and asymmetry in a cross-collaborative environment caused by manual-input and error-prone records. The proposed system was evaluated by two important system performance indicators in terms of average response time and transaction per second. The system performance test shows that the accountability of BCSMS is significant compared to DWSS, given the p-value 0.01. Blockchain effectively improves DWSS with enhanced data submission, identity management and data-driven site performance evaluation functions. This study also qualitatively analyzed the pros and cons of proposed blockchain-enabled cyber-physical system (CPS) from society-economy-technology aspects for technical practitioners, construction stakeholders and governments.},

 abstract = {With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, data sharing among IoT devices has become more frequent. Many researchers have proposed fine-grained access control schemes and searchable encryption algorithms to support privacy-preserving data sharing. But there still exist two challenges. First, the existing schemes are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-limited IoT terminals. Second, they rely on a central server to honestly conduct search operations, making them unable to tackle malicious servers. To this end, we propose a blockchain-enabled data-sharing scheme for IoT that supports lightweight, secure, and searchable data sharing. We design an outsourcing attribute-based encryption algorithm to alleviate the overhead of resource-limited IoT terminals, which reduces the local encryption and decryption to a constant level. Instead of relying on central servers, we leverage smart contract to execute ciphertext retrieval, ensuring the accuracy of search results. Formal security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is chosen-plaintext secure under the DBDH assumption. Experimental simulation shows that it reduces the search time by at least 79.9%, the encryption and decryption complexities to both O(1).},

With the development of Internet of Things and object detection in deep learning, it is possible to enable object detection in end devices. In this paper, we propose a coordinated recognition scheme based on YOLOv3 to automatically detect safety helmets at construction sites. Our scheme provides coordinated recognition from multiple devices to obtain comprehensive detection results with multiple viewpoints, which improves the detection accuracy. Besides, to strengthen the security and reliability of detection devices, we propose a peer-to-peer cooperation scheme which is based on smart contract over blockchain. Our scheme ensures that only trusted devices can initiate or participate coordinated recognition tasks. All access and detection records are stored in the blockchain, which is auditable and traceable. Moreover, we propose a fair video sharing mechanism which encourages trusted devices to actively participate in the coordinated recognition tasks. Only participated nodes can access the shared detection videos from others, which forms an alliance of fair sharing with long term interest. The experimental results and analysis justify that our scheme performs well in terms of security and detection accuracy at few expense of a certain startup delay.

Generally in such a setting, participating workers cooperate to train a comprehensive model by exchanging the trained parameters.

In this paper, we propose a collusion-resistant and privacy-protected FL crowdsourcing scheme implemented by smart contracts. Our proposed scheme supports fair reward distribution in FL, as well as ensuring data privacy and user privacy using homomorphic encryption and pseudo-identity techniques. The evaluation results show that the time cost and gas consumption of the proposed scheme are realistic in practice. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative evaluation of single worker and multi-workers (crowdsourcing) approaches using Alexnet, Resnet and VGG models, showing that FL with greedy mechanism can significantly accelerate the model training without compromising models’ accuracy.

 abstract = {Public auditing enables data owners to entrust a third-party auditor (TPA) to perform auditing tasks periodically. To resist malicious TPAs, a plethora of blockchain-based public auditing mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot effectively mitigate single point of failure and collusion between TPAs and miners. These schemes are burdened by significant wastage of storage resources due to the presence of redundant data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized auditing scheme supporting ciphertext deduplication (BDACD). BDACD leverages a decentralized blockchain, which takes over the role traditionally played by a centralized TPA. A decentralized autonomous organization is incorporated to enhance resistance against collusion attacks. By integrating advanced ciphertext deduplication techniques, BDACD effectively mitigates storage overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept, T-Merkle hash tree, along with a corresponding search algorithm. This innovation significantly enhances blockchain storage utilization and enables efficient half-interval searches within a block. To ensure accountability and fairness, a smart contract is employed to establish an arbitration mechanism. This mechanism serves a dual purpose: penalizing any malevolent actions by cloud servers and providing adequate compensation to data owners whose data integrity has been compromised. Detailed security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate BDACD has desirable security and efficiency.},

 abstract = {Rational miners in the blockchain may admit the validity of search results directly to conserve calculation overhead without executing the validation. Such phenomenon is known as the Verifier's Dilemma that the search results of the blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme would be claimed to have been verified but devoid of valid verification. Besides, the top-k query technique utilized by most existing searchable encryption schemes fails to filter the search results from the user demands during retrieval, which results in massive ineffective access lists with high complexity. Aiming at the two problems, we present a blockchain-based multi-keyword ranked searchable encryption scheme and design a fair payment protocol for multi-user scenarios. Our scheme may achieve public verifiability and user fairness by leveraging the TrueBit network, while the data owner (DO) can withdraw search privileges from the authorized data user (DU). Also, we extend the searchable encryption scheme based on inverted index to multi-DO/multi-DU scenarios, and the HashMap index is used to diminish the response time and space complexity. Moreover, the proposed scheme supports the update of index keywords and files dynamically. To enhance retrieval accuracy, we modify the information divergence algorithm in machine learning and utilize the monotonically weighted aggregation function, which improves retrieval accuracy to around 97%. Finally, Security analysis illustrates correctness and resilience against typical attacks to verify the robustness and utility of the proposed scheme.},

In this regard, we leverage the smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms to improve the existing claim identity model in blockchain to realize the identity unlinkability, effectively avoiding the exposure of the ownership of attributes.

To provide a payment system and record transaction information, public blockchain is designed to match the decentralized feature of the P2P market. The incentive for nodes outside the microgrid is removed but it is maintained for the prosumers within the microgrid. Therefore the number of miner competitors is limited to decrease the mining difficulty and its power consumption. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol defines the function of blockchain with its mining mechanism. Miners sacrifice part of their stake to compensate for the power losses and reduce the price gap from the traditional prosumer-to-grid trading (Feed-in-tariff). Moreover, the proposed model also contributes to increase the social welfare by improving producers’ income and consumers’ cost-saving through the designed pricing scheme, which eliminates the price gap between buying and selling. Successful mining is encouraged by rewards accordingly. A case study is introduced where a microgrid model with 27 prosumers is tested with the PoS public blockchain-based pricing scheme. The process of model implementation and smart contract creation are specifically demonstrated. Numerical results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This process enables respondents to securely own and retain them in their digital wallets, thus creating an immutable record of their whisky taste preferences and personalized recommendations. Finally, a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the value of personalized artwork NFTs. Respondents were asked for preferences between artwork derived from their taste preferences to those with the same whisky recommendations but with randomly sourced background art. Binomial test results revealed a clear preference for artwork based on their personal affirmed that respondents favored artwork based on their personal survey responses.},

In this model, the same energy on the chain is traded within the chain, and the heterogeneous energy on different chains is traded across chains. To trade energy between heterogeneous energy networks more efficiently, the blockchain-based cross-chain model is proposed based on the existing infrastructure. Heterogeneous energy nodes are assigned to different energy sub-chains and cross-chain energy transactions are performed through a relay-chain, which utilizes the improved Boneh–Lynn–Shacham signature scheme consensus algorithm based on the proof-of-stake and practical Byzantine fault tolerance. The experimental simulations on energy trading efficiency, throughput, and security, show its superiority over existing systems.

 abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in real estate investments that utilize blockchain technology. Traditional real estate investments usually involve third-party intermediaries for verifying and recording informal real estate transactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-based real estate investment model and presents a detailed description of the real estate register authentication aspect of the model. The model uses blockchain technology to create tamper-evident records of real estate transactions and provide secure authentication and verification for informal real estate transactions. Meanwhile, each real estate transaction is recorded in a block, and all transaction records are kept on the blockchain. This means that inventors can access these transaction records and verify their authenticity and validity. The system can also use smart contracts to automate the process of real estate transactions, which further improves transaction efficiency and reduces costs. Furthermore, the model's timestamp and authentication mechanism can eliminate third-party intermediaries and ensure the authenticity and validity of real estate transactions through distributed ledgers and verification mechanisms. Overall, blockchain-based real estate systems offer advantages of security, transparency, efficiency, and cost reduction. With ongoing blockchain advancements, these systems are expected to play a crucial role in future real estate investment transactions.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has demonstrated promising potential for covert communication. Although a series of studies have investigated blockchain-based covert communication, systematic research on the information-hiding patterns and covert communication patterns built on the blockchain is absent. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the related patterns. Based on intensive investigation, we abstract and propose a reference model for blockchain-based covert communication. We accordingly identify five types of covert communication patterns, each with different roles for covert senders and covert receivers, which enable one-to-one and one-to-many communication. Using Bitcoin as an example, we analyze the data distribution of covert channels within the block and transaction structure. Furthermore, we compare the hiding patterns and covert communication patterns and discuss the challenges and promising directions to achieve secure, robust, and cost-effective covert communication using blockchain. This work can provide valuable insights into the potential of blockchain technology for covert communication and lay the foundation for future research in this area.},

 abstract = {It is crucial to ensure the privacy and authenticity of patients’ medical data in the medical insurance claim process, but in the current medical insurance claim process, there are some problems such as low efficiency, complex service, unreliable data and data leakage. Therefore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of patients’ medical data, we can improve the current issues by employing blockchain, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof technology. In this paper, we propose a novel medical insurance claim scheme based on smart contracts, blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme mainly involves two scenarios: medical insurance purchasing and medical insurance claiming. In the privacy-preserving transaction phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and privacy of the transactions between the patients and the insurance companies by using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and the homomorphic encryption algorithm under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In the identity privacy-preserving phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and the privacy of patients’ identities by integrating Schnorr protocol and Fiat–Shamir heuristic method. The security analysis, the computation cost and the communication cost of our scheme are given. Compared with our referred schemes, the performance evaluation shows that our scheme not only meets the requirements of the legality of the medical insurance claim, but also ensures the authenticity and privacy of the patients’ medical data. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is feasible and has an acceptable time overhead.},

@article{ZHOU2021155,
 abstract = {With the rapid development of E-commerce, more and more people are used to shopping online, in which the reputation scores of sellers play an important role in helping consumers purchase satisfactory products. However, in the existing E-commerce environments, the reputation scores of users (including sellers and buyers) are centrally computed and stored on a centralized cloud server, which might make errors or even engage in fraud and forgery. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized reputation system (BC-DRS) in the E-commerce environment, i.e., online shopping. In this system, the product information including product descriptions and comments is stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS) and the corresponding address is returned, and the returned address and the reputation scores of users are stored on the blockchain. The reputation evaluation is implemented by designing and deploying a smart contract on the blockchain. Different from the traditional centralized reputation systems (CRSs), the proposed BC-DRS can protect the product information and users reputation scores from intentional and unintentional modifications, since it is very hard to change any data stored in the blockchain and IPFS. Also, as the reputation scores of users are computed and updated by all the ratings of their transactions weighted by the practical transaction factors, it is effective to resist the common attacks, i.e., unfair rating and collusion. In addition, this system also contains a monetary incentive mechanism for the evaluation, which is helpful to form a virtuous circle in online shopping. The proposed BC-DRS is simulated on the popular blockchain platform, i.e., Ethereum with Solidity language. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed BC-DRS has desirable usability and reliability.},

 abstract = {Federated learning combines with fog computing to transform data sharing into model sharing, which solves the issues of data isolation and privacy disclosure in fog computing. However, existing studies focus on centralized single-layer aggregation federated learning architecture, which lack the consideration of cross-domain and asynchronous robustness of federated learning, and rarely integrate verification mechanisms from the perspective of incentives. To address the above challenges, we propose a Blockchain and Signcryption enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning (BSAFL) framework based on dual aggregation for asynchronous cross-domain federated learning scenarios. In particular, we first design two types of signcryption schemes to secure the interaction and access control of collaborative learning between domains. Second, we construct a differential privacy approach that adaptively adjusts privacy budgets to ensure data privacy and local models' availability of intra-domain user. Furthermore, we propose an asynchronous aggregation solution that incorporates consensus verification and elastic participation using blockchain. Finally, security analysis demonstrates the security and privacy effectiveness of BSAFL, and the evaluation on real datasets further validates the high model accuracy and performance of BSAFL.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we utilise blockchain technology (BT) and circular q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (Cq-ROFS) to address practical issues related to urban transportation and supply chain management (SCM). Recognising the weaknesses of earlier approaches such as circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets (C-IFS), we work Cq-ROFS to better accommodate imprecise input. Novel approaches that use into metaverse settings are being investigated as a means of addressing the complex problems associated with urban mobility. This study use the SWARA-AROMAN approach to evaluate potential blockchain integration possibilities for metaverse urban mobility. Sensitivity analysis and comprehensive evaluation yield powerful insights into the robustness and adaptability of solutions. With these findings at their disposal, policymakers will be more equipped to take on unpredictability and take advantage of opportunities for sustainable urban mobility. To enhance urban transportation solutions in the dynamic metaverse, future strategies should concentrate on improving processes and exploring novel technology. Ultimately, this research emphasises how critical it is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and ongoing innovation if we hope to influence the patterns of urban mobility in the metaverse.},
