 abstract = {The current Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data are facing challenges such as data silos, security and privacy concerns, data quality issues, and collaboration barriers. This paper proposes an IoV Information Management System (IIMS) based on parallel intelligence and blockchain to address these challenges. By leveraging the decentralized, immutable, and traceable nature of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanisms and collaborative models of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a secure and trustworthy data sharing platform is established for collaborative analysis, business cooperation, and innovative applications of IoV data. The proposed approach utilizes the decentralized nature and data backup capabilities of blockchain to mitigate the single point of failure issues associated with centralized servers. Additionally, the anonymity, immutability, and traceability features of blockchain ensure the privacy, security, and integrity of data sharing. Moreover, the incentive mechanisms and DAO solutions within the blockchain promote data sharing among vehicles while ensuring data quality.},

 abstract = {With the development of intelligent transportation technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces challenges such as data silos, security and privacy concerns, data quality issues, and collaboration barriers. To address the various challenges, this paper proposes an innovative integration scheme called the IoV Data Management System (IDMS). This system is built upon blockchain and parallel intelligence technologies, aiming to solve the challenges presented in the IoV domain. The proposed system uses the decentralized, immutable and traceable characteristics of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanism and collaboration model of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), to build a secure and trusted data sharing platform to solve data problems in IoV. This research combines parallel intelligence, blockchain and DAO technologies to provide an innovative framework for IoV information management. The proposed framework enables parallel management of connected vehicle systems, thereby improving safety, reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, it would promote the development and application of vehicle networking technology, and provide more intelligent, convenient and safe services for people's travel experience. Finally, a parking data sharing case study validates the effectiveness of the designed system and demonstrates its potential to solve IoV data management challenges.},

 abstract = {Decentralized autonomy is a long-standing research topic in information sciences and social sciences. The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has taken on a leading position in today’s industrial applications by providing salient features and showing significant performance since its beginning. Blockchain began its journey from the concept of cryptocurrency and is now part of a range of core applications to achieve resilience and automation between various tasks. However, with the integration of Blockchain technology into different industrial applications, many application designs, security, and privacy challenges present themselves, posing serious threats to users and their data. Although several approaches have been proposed to address the specific application, security and privacy challenges of targeted applications with limited security enhancement solutions, there is still a need for a comprehensive research study on the application design, security and privacy challenges, and requirements of Blockchain-based industrial applications, along with possible security threats and countermeasures. This study presents a comprehensive and state-of-the-art survey of Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 applications, focusing on potential application design, security and privacy requirements, as well as corresponding attacks on Blockchain systems with potential countermeasures. We also analyse and provide the classification of security and privacy techniques used in these applications to enhance the advancement of security features. Furthermore, we highlight some open issues of integrating Blockchain technology into industrial applications that help design secure Blockchain-based applications as future directions.},

In comparison to the traditional centralized techniques for security and privacy preservation, blockchain uses decentralized consensus algorithms for verification and validation of different transactions which are supposed to become an integral part of blockchain network. Starting with the existing literature survey, we introduce the basic concepts of blockchain and machine learning in this article. Then, we presented a comprehensive taxonomy for integration of blockchain and machine learning in an IoT environment. We also explored federated learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning algorithms usage in blockchain based applications. Finally, we provide recommendations for future use cases of these emerging technologies in 5G and B5G technologies.},

 abstract = {Integrating blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT) for security is a new development in computational communication systems. While security threats are changing their strategies and constructing new threats on blockchain-based IoT systems. Also, in combining blockchain with IoT networks, malicious transactions and active attacks deliver more vulnerabilities, privacy issues, and security threats. The concept of blockchain-based IoT attacks is a hot topic in both IoT and blockchain disciplines. Network attacks are a type of security and privacy threat and cover the exact scope of threats related to the combination of IoT and blockchain. Even though blockchain has potential security benefits, new cyberattacks have emerged that make blockchain alone insufficient to deal with threats and attacks in IoT networks since vagueness and ambiguity issues are unavoidable in IoT data. The heterogeneous nature of IoT sources has made uncertainty a critical issue in IoT networks. Deep Learning (DL) models have difficulty dealing with uncertainty issues and cannot manage them efficiently as an essential tool in security techniques. Thus, we need better security, privacy, and practical approaches, such as efficient threat detection against network attacks in blockchain-based IoT environments. Also helpful to consider fuzzy logic to tackle deterministic issues when DL models face uncertainty. This paper designs and implements a secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework. This framework utilizes a novel fuzzy DL model, optimized adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based attack detection, fuzzy matching (FM), and fuzzy control system (FCS) for detection of network attacks. The proposed fuzzy DL applies the fuzzy Choquet integral to have a powerful nonlinear aggregation function in the detection. We use metaheuristic algorithms to optimize the attack detection error function in ANFIS. We also validate transactions via FM to tackle fraud detection and efficiency in the blockchain layer. This framework is the first secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework that identifies and detects security threats while considering uncertainty issues in IoT networks and having more flexibility in decision-making and accepting transactions in the blockchain layer. Evaluation results verify the efficiency of the blockchain layer in throughput and latency metrics and the intelligent fuzzy layer in performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score) in threat detection on both blockchain and IoT network sides. Additionally, FCS demonstrates that we obtain an effective system (stable model) for threat detection in blockchain-based IoT networks.},
