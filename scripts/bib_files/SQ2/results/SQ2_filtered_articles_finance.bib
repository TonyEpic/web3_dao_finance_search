 abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

 abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are often governed by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which are implemented via governance protocols. Governance tokens are distributed to users of the platform, granting them voting rights in the platform's governance protocol.Many DeFi platforms have already been subject to attacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.  In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.  We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.},

 abstract = {Modern public and private infrastructure is increasingly large and complex regardless of the industry within which it is deployed - communications, power, transportation, manufacturing, finance, etc. Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADSs) analogous to living systems with autonomous and decentralized subsystems have been developed to support the requirements of modern infrastructure. Large-scale infrastructure is increasingly a significant source of data on both its own operations as well as the society dependent on it. Big data from infrastructure can thus supply a variety of artificial and augmented intelligence systems. Large complex infrastructures typically require large complex organizations to operate and maintain. Such organizations though are typically centralized and constrained by bureaucratic policies and procedures. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are emerging that may provide better transparency, autonomy and decentralization for the manner in which these large-scale infrastructures are operated.

The DAO was a crowdfunding project based on blockchain. It was one of the most widely-known blockchain applications in 2016, not only because of the most amount of crowdfunded money (i.e., ETH tokens) so far, in a very short period, but also due to the attack event. In this paper, a brief introduction of The DAO attack event is presented. We also present an acute analysis of the result that “the hacker stole large quantity of money from The DAO”, as well as the analysis of the suggested solution that “the wallet address of the hacker should be frozen” to the event given by The DAO community. Accordingly, two logical paradoxes are formulated on the event results and the proposed solution. Finally, The DAO paradoxes are formally described, analyzed, and proved in propositional logic.},

The increase of dark money in campaign financing and the ability of political spending to influence voter perspectives and decisions puts the credibility of the political finance system at stake. Additionally, with the introduction of blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts to political financing these technologies collectively can serve as a new vehicle for bad actors to use.

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

Blockchain has received considerable attention recently, due to its promises of verifiable, permanent, and decentralized data handling. In 2017–2020, blockchain (and associated technologies such as smart contracts) has progressed beyond cryptocurrencies, and has been hailed as a disruptive technology for a score of industries. This study adds to the growing body of research on blockchain adoption and blockchain-driven innovation in various fields, including transport, finance, and education. However, the impact of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) on the management of science has not been systematically studied so far. This paper aims to fill the gap by studying the experience of adoption of blockchain-based solutions in academia in 2017–2020. The research is based upon a critical review of projects, relevant literature, and qualitative research: interviews (N = 24) and focus groups (N = 4) with startup founders, scholars, university executives, librarians, and IT experts from the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), Russia, and Belarus. Key challenges and barriers to blockchain adoption in academia are delineated: usability and security issues, legal concerns, conflict of values, and a critique of political dimensions of blockchain governance.},

 abstract = {GameFi is a portmanteau of “game” and “finance.” The concept involves blockchain games that offer economic incentives to play, otherwise known as play-to-earn (P2E) games. We explain in detail how GameFi differs from traditional games, and carve out its unique value proposition. We also explore how the mechanics of blockchain games influence the social facet of P2E games, where guilds and clans essentially function as profit-sharing organizations. GameFi leverages disparate elements of the crypto space: tokens, DeFi, and NFTs. Lastly, we discuss in detail some of the challenges of GameFi.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (‘DeFi’) has gained tremendous momentum over the past three years by using novel approaches to disintermediating financial institutions in the provision of financial services. However, empirical research in this field is still rare, and a more comprehensive understanding of the domain is a missing component in academic research. This paper develops a taxonomy based on a comprehensive literature analysis to systematically structure this emerging field. The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, traditional payment methods such as cash, cheques, credit/debit cards, and bank transfers are commonly used for financial transactions across a wide range of industries, including healthcare, real estate, supply chain, gaming, music, finance, retail, agriculture, tourism, pharmaceuticals, and the education sector too. However, these methods often involve transaction fees, potential delays, and security concerns. These methods lack transparency and traceability features, making tracking, authenticating, and verifying payments and their associated records difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based online payment system that leverages blockchain technology (BT) features and security to revolutionize financial expenses in the education sector. We also present wallet generation, fee tokenization and NFT generation processes. These processes utilize Ethereum and an interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store metadata information associated with fee payment details securely. We use Remix IDE, MetaMask wallet, and Sepolia test network to deploy and analyze the proposed system's results. We have also used the JMeter simulation toolkit to conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of throughput, latency, and response time. Our assessment identifies the increase in performance parameters with the number of users. This initiative will positively contribute towards addressing the issues of financial transactions in the education sector.},

 abstract = {Societies at large still grapple to categorize digital space as a phenomenon. At the same time, scientists and developers are searching for innovative methods to better understand how the fundamental shifts caused by digital change will affect the future of humanity over the coming decades. Interdisciplinary governance research at the intersection of technological and environmental foresight is urgently needed to minimize the risks of technological change and explore how digitalization may support, hinder or re-shape sustainability transformations. In this article, we focus on the case of ‘blockchain’ or distributed-ledger technology (DLT) to investigate how recent digital technologies may support the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. Our investigation is centered on areas of public administration and governance which will most likely see an adoption of DLT over the next two decades, such as digital identity, social service provision, and innovative climate finance. To allow for a meaningful comparison of various use cases, we propose four guiding questions that can help researchers, decision-makers and practitioners to determine whether DLT might be an appropriate choice for the sustainability-related task at hand. Moreover, we illustrate how the initial design and subsequent implementation of DLTs may support more centralized or networked modes of governance.},

 abstract = {Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial industry in recent years. Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.},
