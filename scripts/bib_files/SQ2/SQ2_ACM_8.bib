abstract = {Decentralized applications are composed of distributed entities that directly interact with each other and make local autonomous decisions in the absence of a centralized coordinating authority. Such decentralized applications, where entities can join and leave the system at any time, are particularly susceptible to the attacks of malicious entities. Each entity therefore requires protective measures to safeguard itself against these entities. Trust management solutions serve to provide effective protective measures against such malicious attacks. Trust relationships help an entity model and evaluate its confidence in other entities towards securing itself. Trust management is, thus, both an essential and intrinsic ingredient of decentralized applications. However, research in trust management has not focused on how trust models can be composed into a decentralized architecture. The PACE architectural style, described previously [21], provides structured and detailed guidance on the assimilation of trust models into a decentralized entity's architecture. In this paper, we describe our experiments with incorporating four different reputation-based trust models into a decentralized application using the PACE architectural style. Our observations lead us to conclude that PACE not only provides an effective and easy way to integrate trust management into decentralized applications, but also facilitates reuse while supporting different types of trust models. Additionally, PACE serves as a suitable platform to aid the evaluation and comparison of trust models in a fixed setting towards providing a way to choose an appropriate model for the setting.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an approach for improving the accuracy of shared opinions in a large decentralised team. Specifically, our solution optimises the opinion sharing process in order to help the majority of agents to form the correct opinion about a state of a common subject of interest, given only few agents with noisy sensors in the large team. We build on existing research that has examined models of this opinion sharing problem and shown the existence of optimal parameters where incorrect opinions are filtered out during the sharing process. In order to exploit this collective behaviour in complex networks, we present a new decentralised algorithm that allows each agent to gradually regulate the importance of its neighbours' opinions (their social influence). This leads the system to the optimised state in which agents are most likely to filter incorrect opinions, and form a correct opinion regarding the subject of interest. Crucially, our algorithm is the first that does not introduce additional communication over the opinion sharing itself. Using it 80-90\% of the agents form the correct opinion, in contrast to 60-75\% with the existing message-passing algorithm DACOR proposed for this setting. Moreover, our solution is adaptive to the network topology and scales to thousands of agents. Finally, the use of our algorithm allows agents to significantly improve their accuracy even when deployed by only half of the team.},

In this context, engineering fine-grained authorization controls (that comply with the LGPD) to decentralized web application requires creating audit trails, possibly in the source code. Although the literature offers some solutions, they are scattered. We present Esfinge Guardian, an authorization framework that completely separates authorization from other concerns, which increases compliance with the LGPD.

abstract = {This paper introduces flash organizations: crowds structured like organizations to achieve complex and open-ended goals. Microtask workflows, the dominant crowdsourcing structures today, only enable goals that are so simple and modular that their path can be entirely pre-defined. We present a system that organizes crowd workers into computationally-represented structures inspired by those used in organizations - roles, teams, and hierarchies - which support emergent and adaptive coordination toward open-ended goals. Our system introduces two technical contributions: 1) encoding the crowd's division of labor into de-individualized roles, much as movie crews or disaster response teams use roles to support coordination between on-demand workers who have not worked together before; and 2) reconfiguring these structures through a model inspired by version control, enabling continuous adaptation of the work and the division of labor. We report a deployment in which flash organizations successfully carried out open-ended and complex goals previously out of reach for crowdsourcing, including product design, software development, and game production. This research demonstrates digitally networked organizations that flexibly assemble and reassemble themselves from a globally distributed online workforce to accomplish complex work.},

abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) or blockchains have been steadily emerging and providing innovation in the past decade for several use cases, ranging from financial networks, to notarization, or trustworthy execution via smart contracts. DLTs are enticing due to their properties of decentralization, non-repudiation, and auditability (transparency). These properties are of high potential to access control systems that can be implemented on-chain, and are executed without infringement and full transparency.While it remains uncertain which use cases will truly turn out to be viable, many use cases such as financial transactions can benefit from integrating certain restrictions via access control on the blockchain. In addition, smart contracts may in the future present security risks that are currently yet unknown. As a solution, access control policies can provide flexibility in the execution flow when adopted by smart contracts.In this paper, we present our DEDACS architecture which provides decentralized and dynamic access control for smart contracts in a policy-based manner. Our access control is expressive as it features policies, and dynamic as the environment or users can be changed, or alternative policies can be assigned to smart contracts. DEDACS ensures that our access control preserves the desired properties of decentralization and transparency, while aiming to keep the costs involved as minimal as possible. We have evaluated DEDACS in the context of a Uniswap token-exchange platform, in which we evaluated the costs related to (i) the introduced overhead at deployment time and (ii) the operational overhead cost. DEDACS introduces a relative overhead of on average 52\% at deployment time, and an operational overhead between 52\% and 80\% depending on the chosen policy and its complexity.},

abstract = {This paper reports experiences and outcomes of designing and developing an agent-based, autonomous mission control system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Most UAVs are not truly autonomous or even unmanned but are more correctly termed 'uninhabited' or 'remotely piloted'. This paper explores two quite different approaches for adding autonomous control to an existing UAV. Both designs were implemented using an agent-based language. The first takes a fairly standard approach, adding a layer over the flight control system to control the mission. The second takes the human metaphor of agency more seriously and implements an autonomous controller based on a model of human decision making widely referenced in the military command and control literature. Implementing these two designs allowed a comparison of their relative strengths and weaknesses. Preliminary findings indicate both the feasibility and usefulness of a human cognitive modelling approach to providing autonomous UAV control but indicate a number of important considerations. This paper also reports on the successful first flight trials of the Codarra Avatar UAV under the mission control of the agent and discusses the future flight test program.},

abstract = {Autonomous and/or Intelligent Systems (A/IS) are often conceptualised according to a model of autonomy characterised by an absence of interference, also called negative autonomy. What makes a system autonomous, according to this model, is the feature of independently giving a rule to oneself. Feminist critiques of autonomy, including relational critiques, challenge this negative model by drawing attention to the necessity of interdependence, connection, and entanglement. With that in mind, this paper explores how relational theories of autonomy help to speculate other futures for A/IS. It views A/IS not as discrete isolated individuals governed by negative liberty, but as interdependent, entangled constellations.Considering A/IS otherwise, not as self-prescribing, isolated nodes, but as vast constellations of material, philosophical and political realities, has far reaching consequences for an individualist ethics that holds only single discrete individuals accountable. This paper explores some of the ways in which this might be possible, through concept of relational autonomy, and semiotics.},

Many developers are already familiar with the notion of personal data stores; this tutorial will demonstrate how to access or provide such stores for users, and build simple web applications which read and write to the storage whilst remaining completely decoupled from it. This advantages developers in two ways: by removing the burden of storing and maintaining a canonical copy of user data; and by enabling access to and ease of integration with data created through other applications, creating richer, seamless experiences. From the application users' perspective, they need no longer commit and become bound to particular services, but can mix, match and move between those that best meet their needs.We will introduce Solid, a set of protocols based on existing W3C recommendations, for reading, writing and access control of the contents of a personal data store, which can be layered up in order to integrate various social features into new or existing web applications. Attendees will leave with an understanding of Solid and how different parts of the protocols can work together, and having written some code to implement the parts that interest them most. They will also have hands on experience with existing libraries and tooling to facilitate working with the Solid protocols. Those who stay for the full day will have an opportunity to build a small but complete web application with decentralized social features, and to collaborate with others to see the advantages of sharing data between multiple applications.},

abstract = {A central challenge of autonomic computing is to enable large-scale computing systems--and the self-managing elements of which they are composed--to manage themselves in accordance with high-level objectives specified by people [2]. From the earliest days of autonomic computing, utility functions have been promoted by many authors [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9] as a powerful and principled means for representing high-level objectives. Once a utility function has been elicited, a combination of modeling, optimization, and (sometimes) learning techniques may be applied to this explicit mathematical representation of the objectives to determine an optimal solution for the control variables [3]. Since autonomic systems are by their nature large, complex, and decentralized [8], issues of decentralization deeply affect every phase of the utility function approach: elicitation, modeling, optimization, learning, and sensing and actuation.I will describe several autonomic systems that my colleagues and I have built at IBM Research, some of which have been commercialized. Each has employed a different mechanism for coordinating the actions of multiple auto-nomic managers to realize a system-wide objective, or a collection of individual objectives. Our most recent efforts have centered around reducing energy consumption in data centers, a problem that requires us to consider not just energy, but performance, availability, and other management issues as well. While from a purely academic perspective it is very tempting to formulate data center management as a single centralized optimization, the reality is that the scale and heterogeneity of the physical and IT infrastructure, the wide range of relevant spatial and temporal scales, and the mixture of several types of management concerns renders a centralized approach completely impractical. I will detail two distinct decentralized approaches that we have explored, one based on a federation of semi-autonomous managers with some centralized computation, and the other based on a more strongly decentralized market economy of resource consumers and producers.The ultimate grand unified theory of autonomic computing still eludes us, but I will offer insights gleaned from our experiences, and conclude with thoughts about the many remaining challenges of engineering decentralized autonomic computing systems.},

X-Road serves as the backbone of digital infrastructure in the public sector (e.g., enabling Estonia’s digital public services) and private sector (e.g., enabling clients’ data exchange in the Japanese energy sector). An approach and architecture were recently proposed for the X-Road data exchange systems to move from public key infrastructure (PKI) with centralised certification authorities to decentralised PKI (DPKI). In this paper, we develop a proof of concept for the designed DPKI-based architecture that leverages distributed ledger-based identifiers and verifiable credentials to establish trust between information systems using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. We evaluate the proof of concept implementation against the design and functional requirements. The results show that the proposed system architecture is technically feasible and satisfies the identified design goals and functional requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first open-access system prototype for an organisation’s identity management following self-sovereign identity principles. The presented proof of concept proves that DPKI helps to address some of the scalability issues of PKI, improve control over identity and mitigate replay attacks and a single point of failure in the X-Road system.},

Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a threshold EdDSA that allows n parties to generate keys in a decentralized and distributed manner. Any t + 1-of-n parties can generate standard EdDSA signatures. This scheme supports an arbitrary threshold (t, n) and has been proven to be secure against at most t malicious adversaries. The theoretical analysis (computation complexity and communication footprints) and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs efficiently on cloud servers and embedded devices. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is integrated with Tendermint, a blockchain framework that uses EdDSA, to generate keys and sign transactions in a decentralized manner, which indicates that this scheme is compatible with blockchains for supporting DeFi applications.},

abstract = {In the context of large distributed modular robots, self-reconfiguration is the process of having modules, seen as autonomous agents, acting together and moving to transform the morphology of their physical arrangement to produce a desired shape. However, due to motion constraints, the number of modules that can move concurrently is greatly limited, thus making self-reconfiguration a very slow process. In this paper, we propose an approach for accelerating self-reconfiguration to build a porous version of the desired shape, using scaffolding. We expand this idea and propose a method for constructing a parametric scaffolding model that increases the parallelism of the reconfiguration, supports its mechanical stability, and simplifies planning and coordination between agents. Each agent has a set of basic rules using only four states which guarantees that module movements and the construction of the scaffold are deterministic.  Coupled with an underneath reserve of modules that allows the introduction of rotating quasi-spherical modules at various ground locations of the growing porous structure, our method is able to build the scaffolding structure in $O(N^frac2 3 )$ time with N the number of modules composing the structure. Furthermore, we provide simulation results showing that our method uses $O(N^frac4 3 )$ messages with no congestion.},

Despite this, the solution allows users to rent anything they wish (ranging from power tools to cars or lands) in a decentralized manner through a system designed with the usage of smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or applications enhancing this decentralized technology, also known as dApps. Our solution utilizes a Multichain NFT bridge by XP Network that enhances NFT transfers from one chain to another and uses an Axelar GMP protocol to connect Polkadot Parachain called Moonbeam with Ethereum. This allows users to transfer assets from one chain to another.

Specifically, we prove the optimality of B-MOMS in acyclic constraint graphs, and derive problem dependent bounds on its approximation ratio when these graphs contain cycles. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate its performance on a multi-objective extension of the canonical graph colouring problem. In so doing, we demonstrate that, for the settings we consider, the approximation ratio never exceeds 2, and is typically less than 1.5 for less-constrained graphs. Moreover, the runtime required by B-MOMS on the problem instances we considered never exceeds 30 minutes, even for maximally constrained graphs with 100 agents. Thus, B-MOMS brings the problem of multi-objective optimisation well within the boundaries of the limited capabilities of embedded agents.},

In this context decentralised multi-agent planning can be efficient as well as effective, especially in loosely-coupled domains, whilst also ensuring important properties in agent systems such as privacy and autonomy. In this paper, we describe the DOMAP planning framework and its integration with a multi-agent programming platform to support the achievement of social goals. Our planning framework has separate phases for goal allocation and individual HTN planning, whilst relying on available runtime coordination.

There is active research on OMOkC, particularly in the design of decentralised algorithms for solving it. We propose a new take on the issue: Rather than classically developing new algorithms, we apply a macro-level paradigm, called aggregate computing, specifically designed to directly program the global behaviour of a whole ensemble of devices at once. To understand the potential of the application of aggregate computing to OMOkC, we extend the Alchemist simulator (supporting aggregate computing natively) with a novel toolchain component supporting the simulation of mobile robots. This way, we build a software engineering toolchain comprising language and simulation tooling for addressing OMOkC. Finally, we exercise our approach and related toolchain by introducing new algorithms for OMOkC; we show that they can be expressed concisely, reuse existing software components and perform better than the current state-of-the-art in terms of coverage over time and number of objects covered overall.},

abstract = {In many distributed systems, from cloud to sensor networks, different configurations impact system performance, while strongly depending on the network topology. Hence, topological changes may entail costly reconfiguration and optimisation processes. This paper proposes a multi-agent solution for recovering a network's topology in case of node failures. The proposed approach relies on local information about the network's topology, collected and disseminated at runtime. Two strategies for distributing topological data are studied: one based on Mobile Agents (our proposal) and the other based on Trickle (a reference gossiping protocol from the literature). These two strategies were adapted for our self-healing approach, to collect topological information for network recovery; and were evaluated in terms of resource overheads. Experimental results show that both variants can recover the network topology, up to a certain node failure rate, which depends on the network topology. At the same time, Mobile Agents collect less information, focusing on local dissemination, which suffices for network recovery. This entails less bandwidth overheads than when Trickle is used. Still, Mobile Agents utilise more memory and exchange more messages during data-collection than Trickle does. These results validate the viability of the proposed self-healing solution, offering two variant implementations with diverse performance characteristics, which may suit different application domains.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in engineering distributed multiagent systems is the coordination necessary to align the behavior of different agents. Decentralization of control implies a style of coordination in which the agents cooperate as peers with respect to each other and no agent has global control over the system, or global knowledge about the system. The dynamic interactions and collaborations among agents are usually structured and managed by means of roles and organizations. In existing approaches agents typically have a dual responsibility: on the one hand playing roles within the organization, on the other hand managing the life-cycle of the organization itself, for example, setting up the organization and managing organization dynamics. Engineering realistic multiagent systems in which agents encapsulate this dual responsibility is a complex task.In this article, we present a middleware for context-driven dynamic agent organizations. The middleware is part of an integrated approach, called MACODO: Middleware Architecture for COntext-driven Dynamic agent Organizations. The complementary part of the MACODO approach is an organization model that defines abstractions to support application developers in describing dynamic organizations, as described in Weyns et al. [2010].The MACODO middleware offers the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations as a reusable service separated from the agents, which makes it easier to understand, design, and manage dynamic organizations in multiagent systems. We give a detailed description of the software architecture of the MADOCO middleware. The software architecture describes the essential building blocks of a distributed middleware platform that supports the MACODO organization model. We used the middleware architecture to develop a prototype middleware platform for a traffic monitoring application. We evaluate the MACODO middeware architecture by assessing the adaptability, scalability, and robustness of the prototype platform.},

Agents require a means to find each other and communicate without reliance on a centralized party and participation in the system must be permissionless. We present the Agent Communication Network (ACN), a peer-to-peer lookup system that provides a distributed overlay to the Internet and addresses this problem. The ACN enables agents to find each other and to communicate safely. It achieves this by leveraging a distributed hash table for agent lookup, maintained by participating peers and through the use of public-key cryptography. The paper discusses the properties of the system and its guarantees as well as its integration with a novel multi-agent system. Preliminary benchmark results demonstrate the feasibility of the system, its performance, and its scalability.},

Orders to be sent to the energy micro-generation units are produced off-line by an evolutionary computation method. The orders are encoded into the agents once the micro-grid is started and agents decide when to apply them. The paper includes experiments that show the resulting behavior in several scenarios executed in real time. Results indicate the technique is stable enough and outperforms more simple approaches, a necessary initial step prior to a more comprehensive comparison with other solutions.},

abstract = {This article describes Decentralised Emergence Detection (DETect), a novel distributed algorithm that enables agents to collaboratively detect emergent events in Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Non-deterministic interactions between agents in CAS can give rise to emergent behaviour or properties at the system level. The nature, timing, and consequence of emergence is unpredictable and may be harmful to the system or individual agents. DETect relies on the feedback that occurs from the system level (macro) to the agent level (micro) when emergence occurs. This feedback constrains agents at the micro level and results in changes occurring in the relationship between an agent and its environment. DETect uses statistical methods to automatically select the properties of the agent and environment to monitor and tracks the relationship between these properties over time. When a significant change is detected, the algorithm uses distributed consensus to determine if a sufficient number of agents have simultaneously experienced a similar change. On agreement of emergence, DETect raises an event, which its agent or other interested observers can use to act appropriately. The approach is evaluated using a multi-agent case study.},

Two existing methods both share the same goal of reaching blockchain consensus; however, the processes are different: The proof of Work system is completely related to tasks, but the Proof of Stake system is related to tokens. Hence, service providers are more than glad to apply the Proof of Work theory after distinguishing the difference between these two systems; this system which does not have high limitations is more fair and balanced. To enhance the traditional Proof of Work system, Artificial Intelligence can properly help and make the new framework works more efficiently. AI model can pre-assign a trustworthy score via the IP address, and then it can take the responsibility to generate the puzzle for the qualification. After the model verifies the output, the trustworthy score can increase or decrease based on the performance. Finally, it can establish a loop from the trustworthy score to puzzle difficulty, and then back to the trustworthy score. Therefore, an AI assistant can accurately monitor the entire transaction process and ensure validation to be environmentally friendly.},

abstract = {Highly reliable organizations (HROs) are those organizations, which by nature or design, cannot or must not fail; the consequences of failure in such systems are usually catastrophic. Systems that combine the characteristics of highly reliable operations and distributed, virtual organizations are known as highly reliable virtual organizations (HRVOs)—distributed and electronically linked groups of organizations that excel in high-consequence settings. Tsunami warning systems (TWS) are one example of virtual organizations that operate under enormous expectations for reliability. Adaptive structuration theory suggests that, in complex systems, technology and organizational structures co-evolve, and users adapt technology to their needs, creating shared meaning about the role and utility of technology in various settings. In this article, we consider how the shared meaning that develops in the social shaping of technology in one HRVO, tsunami warning systems, contributes to reliability enhancement. Following Poole and DeSanctis [2000], this study is a structuration study in a particular context, exploring how structuration occurs, the conditions that influence it, and its consequences or outcomes. We begin by describing HRVOs and the co-adaptive roles that technology and organizational structures play in such organizations. We then describe a global tsunami warning system as an illustrative case of a globally distributed sociotechnical system for which use of technology and distributed organizational structures should enhance reliability. We describe how social media plays a role in adaptive structuration in tsunami warning systems, and then return to consider the nature of HRVOs and their characteristics, en route to identifying challenges in the co-adaptation of technology and organizational structures in highly reliable tsunami warning systems.},

To this end, we cast the optimal dispatch problem as a decentralised agent-based coordination problem and formalise it as a DCOP. We show how this can be decomposed as a factor graph and solved in a decentralised manner using algorithms based on the generalised distributive law; in particular, the max-sum algorithm. We go on to show that max-sum applied na\"{\i}vely in this setting performs a large number of redundant computations. To address this issue, we present a novel decentralised message passing algorithm using dynamic programming that outperforms max-sum by pruning the search space. We empirically evaluate our algorithm using real distribution network data, showing that it outperforms (in terms of computational time and total size of messages sent) both a centralised approach, which uses IBM's ILOG CPLEX 12.2, and max-sum, for large networks.},

abstract = {Warehouse commissioning is a complex task in which a team of robots needs to gather and deliver items as fast and efficiently as possible while adhering to the constraint capacity of the robots. Typical centralised control approaches can quickly become infeasible when dealing with many robots. Instead, we tackle this spatial task allocation problem via distributed planning on each robot in the system. State of the art distributed planning approaches suffer from a number of limiting assumptions and ad-hoc approximations. This paper demonstrates how to use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations and provide scalability in a more principled manner. Our simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that this translates to higher task performance, especially when tasks get more complex. Moreover, this higher performance does not come at the cost of scalability: in fact, the proposed approach scales better than the previous best approach, demonstrating excellent performance on an 8-robot team servicing a warehouse comprised of over 200 locations.},

However, a unified framework to analyze and compare different selection mechanisms is largely missing. To address this gap, we advocate employing concepts and tools from computational social choice to devise a model in which different selection mechanisms can be formalized. Such a model would allow for conceptualizing and evaluating desirable representation axioms. We make the first step in this direction by proposing a unifying mathematical formulation of different selection mechanisms as well as various social-choice-inspired axioms such as proportionality and monotonicity.},

abstract = {The control, governance, and management of the web have become increasingly centralised, resulting in security, privacy, and censorship concerns. Decentralised initiatives have emerged to address these issues, beginning with decentralised file systems. These systems have gained popularity, with major platforms serving millions of content requests daily. Complementing the file systems are decentralised search engines and name-registry infrastructures, together forming the basis of a decentralised web. This survey article analyses research trends and emerging technologies for content retrieval on the decentralised web, encompassing both academic literature and industrial projects.Several challenges hinder the realisation of a fully decentralised web. Achieving comparable performance to centralised systems without compromising decentralisation is a key challenge. Hybrid infrastructures, blending centralised components with verifiability mechanisms, show promise to improve decentralised initiatives. While decentralised file systems have seen more mature deployments, they still face challenges such as usability, performance, privacy, and content moderation. Integrating these systems with decentralised name-registries offers a potential for improved usability with human-readable and persistent names for content. Further research is needed to address security concerns in decentralised name-registries and enhance governance and crypto-economic incentive mechanisms.},

abstract = {The centenaries of former chapters of the British Music Society (BMS), established in 1918, have prompted their governing bodies to take stock of their histories and build on the cataloguing, documentation and preservation of their archival collections. The InterMusE project aims to support this shared instinct to archive by capturing and, crucially, linking different forms of data regarding the musical events provided by three of these local concert-giving organisations, beginning with the digitisation of their collections and with a view to producing a dynamic, open-access digital archive. This paper outlines our approach to establishing a foundation for developing a new kind of digital archive for musicology that is both valuable for researchers, fulfils the needs of the societies and their communities, and sheds light on community music-making on a national and, ultimately, international scale. By carrying out a series of preliminary scoping exercises, including informal interviews and archival-collection assessments, we can compare current archiving and preservation activities across the societies. These conversations bring emerging themes, issues and challenges into focus, raising pertinent questions that will inform our development of transformative tools and techniques for community digitisation projects.},

Besides requiring fast response time, increased security and privacy, they lack computational resources at the edge of the network. Such computational resources distributed closer to the edge represent the fundamental infrastructure of edge and fog paradigms. However, without advanced resource management techniques, the advantages of the paradigms are lost. In this paper, we present a novel distributed resource allocation algorithm with the purpose of enabling seamless integration and deployment of different applications in an IoT infrastructure. The algorithm decides: the (i) mapping of IoT application at the edge of the network, (ii) dynamic migration of parts of the application, such that Service Level Agreement (SLA) is satisfied. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss our approach and the potential to minimize the latency of different IoT applications.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is a new way to compute in the cloud that further simplifies the user's management burden and allows the user to focus on its core business. Most existing FaaS systems are centralized, i.e., the infrastructure is owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. This character brings a few limitations. For instance, an end user will be bound with a specific cloud service provider and there is a risk of single point of failure. In order to mitigate these limitations, a natural idea is to build a decentralized FaaS system. In this paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system that uses blockchain technology and decentralized API management to build a decentralized FaaS system, which enables greater scalability, flexibility, improved security, and reliability. Specifically, DeFaaS uses a blockchain to create a decentralized registry of available functions (services) and manage their execution. An application interacts with the blockchain to discover and invoke functions securely and transparently. In addition to providing a reliable and scalable platform for decentralized FaaS, DeFaaS can support other distributed computing scenarios, such as dApps, volunteer computing, and multi-cloud service mesh. Overall, our proposed system represents a significant advance in the field of decentralized computing and has the potential to enable a wide range of exciting new applications and use cases.},

abstract = {Optimising the IT infrastructure of large, often geographically distributed, organisations goes beyond the classical virtual machine reassignment problem, for two reasons: (i) the data centres of these organisations are composed of a number of hosting departments which have different preferences on what to host and where to host it; (ii) the top-level managers in these data centres make complex decisions and need to manipulate possible solutions favouring different objectives to find the right balance. This challenge has not yet been comprehensively addressed in the literature and in this paper we demonstrate that a multi-objective VM reassignment is feasible for large decentralised data centres. We show on a realistic data set that our solution outperforms other classical multi-objective algorithms for VM reassignment in terms of quantity of solutions (by about 15\% on average) and quality of the solutions set (by over 6\% on average).},
