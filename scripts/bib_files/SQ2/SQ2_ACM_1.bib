abstract = {Since the emergence of Ethereum, blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps) have become increasingly popular and important. To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework, \DH{}Archer, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have evaluated \DH{}Archer on 11 popular real-world DApps. \DH{}Archer achieves high precision (99.3\%), recall (87.6\%), and accuracy (89.4\%) in bug detection and significantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs in the 11 DApps. So far, six of the 15 bugs have been confirmed by the developers, and three have been fixed. These promising results demonstrate the usefulness of \DH{}Archer.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a carrier of unique identity as a virtual currency. Its indivisible, unique, and verifiable characteristics can truly reflect personal assets and virtual assets to a certain extent. It is widely applied by users in art, games, collectibles and other areas. NFT is stored on the blockchain. The user's digital signature is embedded into the NFT record, which is distributed through a smart contract and verified by the blockchain consensus mechanism, thus solving the problem of identity confirmation in digital asset transactions. This paper makes a review of the main processes and key technologies in NFT applications. First, it introduces the life of NFT: minting, distribution, storage and circulation. Then, the key technologies of NFT are explained, including the blockchain smart contracts and consensus mechanisms in NFT distribution and transaction, the token standards that the minting and transaction process of NFT needs to use, and the important role of NFT in the field of web3. Finally, through the evaluation system of NFT, the problems existing in the current NFT applications and the future research direction are drawn out.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are a method for implementing direct democracy in virtual worlds. However, it is not clear whether voting preferences in the virtual world will mirror real-world voting preferences. We present a within-subject study in which participants were asked to allocate voting power in two scenarios. The first scenario probed participants’ opinion about the divisibility of voting rights. The second scenario presented participants with the case of unequal allocation of voting power in a virtual world, enforced by smart contracts. In both scenarios, participants allocated voting power and rated the fairness of their decision. Our study finds that participants’ voting preferences in the virtual world scenario did not mirror their real-world preferences and beliefs. Voting systems in the metaverse need to be carefully designed to align with human values and ethics.},

abstract = {With the fast growth of the internet industry, particularly information technology, the smart grid concept has been developed. The smart grid is an attempt to enhance and rejuvenate the secondary sector (the traditional power sector). In the contemporary context, the goal of constructing smart grids is to create a fair and healthy competitive energy market environment. Simultaneously, doing so can help to safeguard the environment and achieve carbon neutrality. With the advent of blockchain, new ideas for smart grid solutions have been developed and implemented. From the standpoint of blockchain types, this article details the aims and contributions made by state of the art technologies, particularly in the field of security. Further, we summarize the shortcomings of existing technologies and the relatively understudied security topics. Then we propose recommendations and describe what the future smart grid should achieve in terms of security.},

However, a unified framework to analyze and compare different selection mechanisms is largely missing. To address this gap, we advocate employing concepts and tools from computational social choice to devise a model in which different selection mechanisms can be formalized. Such a model would allow for conceptualizing and evaluating desirable representation axioms. We make the first step in this direction by proposing a unifying mathematical formulation of different selection mechanisms as well as various social-choice-inspired axioms such as proportionality and monotonicity.},

Specifically, this paper reviews the scholarly insights on the importance of and difficulties in governing the metaverse, recaps researchers’ debate on the governance mode of the metaverse, and discusses five key issues in the metaverse governance, including increased surveillance risks, regulatory and legal issues, data management, ethical concerns, and implications for individuals. Based on insights gained from the literature review, this paper further summarizes the features of extant research on metaverse governance, identifies research gaps, and proposes future research directions.},

abstract = {For several decades, project management (PM) was carried out in a traditional way, mostly without the aid of software tools. This scenario changed so that several PM information systems have been developed to assist project managers in many fields, including software projects. Similar to other systems, such tools started operating in mobile devices, given increasing adoption and use. Therefore, a study on how mobile applications have been used to manage software projects becomes important. In this paper, we report on a survey research carried out with 75 software project managers to identify the most used mobile applications and where they are mostly applied in PM. A quantitative analysis shows that 57\% of the participants do not use mobile PM applications. However, mobile applications such as Trello, Jira and Redmine are mostly used by software project managers. A qualitative analysis was carried out to understand the reasons that lead software project managers to avoid those tools, such as: lack of effectiveness, lack of resources, lack of stimulation, diversity of tools, project complexity, and lack of qualified practitioners. This study brings some improvement suggestions on the existing tools as well as demands for new ones towards a more effective project management support.},

abstract = {People are getting familiar with cryptocurrencies because of the rapid development of cryptography, and bitcoin, a traditional decentralized digital currency, becomes famous. Thus, it is necessary to establish a digital currency allocation framework. Two existing methods both share the same goal of reaching blockchain consensus; however, the processes are different: The proof of Work system is completely related to tasks, but the Proof of Stake system is related to tokens. Hence, service providers are more than glad to apply the Proof of Work theory after distinguishing the difference between these two systems; this system which does not have high limitations is more fair and balanced. To enhance the traditional Proof of Work system, Artificial Intelligence can properly help and make the new framework works more efficiently. AI model can pre-assign a trustworthy score via the IP address, and then it can take the responsibility to generate the puzzle for the qualification. After the model verifies the output, the trustworthy score can increase or decrease based on the performance. Finally, it can establish a loop from the trustworthy score to puzzle difficulty, and then back to the trustworthy score. Therefore, an AI assistant can accurately monitor the entire transaction process and ensure validation to be environmentally friendly.},

Energy efficiency has become a critical non-functional requirement for Android applications. Most applications use multiple hardware elements that may consume a great amount of energy. Moreover, energy faults and bad resource management may aggravate this issue. Several works have proposed solutions to help developers deal with energy consumption issues. In this work, we present a systematic mapping study on energy efficiency testing for Android applications. From a starting set of 1525 papers, we narrowed our investigation to 32 relevant ones. The most common research topics were Fine-grained Estimation with nine studies, followed by Test Generation and Classification, both with six studies. We also found that most apply only dynamic solutions and use software-based strategies to estimate energy consumption. Finally, we discuss a series of open problems that should be addressed by future research.},

The concept of blockchain involves linking a series of transaction blocks together in a chain, with each block being encrypted and inaccessible to anyone who lacks unanimous agreement. BC is comprised of five core stages, but the focus of this paper is on BC 2.0, specifically smart contracts. Smart contracts are utilized to ensure appropriate access controls and the enforcement of contracts. Digital signatures are essential for transactions in smart contracts, and various signature algorithms are employed, including ECDSA and EdDSA. The research problem is to compare and contrast the levels of security offered by two digital signature algorithms, ECDSA and EdDSA, which are employed in smart contracts. The primary objective of this study is to determine which digital signature algorithm performs better in terms of security.},

Blockchain technology, initially designed to support cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has evolved into a versatile platform with the potential to provide trust, transparency, and data immutability in a wide range of applications. Concurrently, zero-knowledge proofs have emerged as a pioneering approach to safeguarding data privacy, allowing parties to validate information without disclosing the underlying data. This review paper thoroughly investigates the convergence of blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs, aiming to understand how their synergy can foster privacy-preserving transactions. We examine the foundational principles of zero-knowledge proofs, their theoretical underpinnings, and practical implementation within blockchain networks. Through a comprehensive analysis, we assess the effectiveness of this amalgamation in protecting sensitive data and consider its applicability to diverse use cases. This review provides a detailed exploration of the synergistic potential of blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs in reshaping the landscape of data privacy in an increasingly interconnected world.},

abstract = {The non-fungible token (NFT) market has experienced significant growth in recent years. Similar to real estate and artwork, NFT is illiquid and it does not have a market price. Thus, there arises a need for a comprehensive scoring system to analyze the value of NFTs. Using a single score is often inadequate, as NFT value is influenced by numerous factors and is assessed based on personal objectives. Addressing the issue, this study explores critical factors influencing NFT value and develops three scores to rank NFTs including rarity, return on investment (ROI), and reputation score. The scores serve to evaluate both NFTs and NFT collections. (i) The rarity score evaluates the level of scarcity, and it applies to NFTs within a collection. (ii) The reputation score evaluates the interest of communities in NFT projects, considering the number of followers and the interaction rate; the score is for NFT collections. (iii) The ROI score assesses the profit generated by NFTs; it applies to both NFTs and NFT collections. Our empirical results show that a well-distributed rarity score of NFTs enhances their demand and profit; high-rarity NFTs are typically associated with a low number of sale transactions. NFT collections with high ROI and high reputation generally draw more attention and yield a positive return. In addition to the three scores, this paper presents a system to collect and process a huge amount of blockchain and social network data for NFT evaluation.},

abstract = {Microservice architecture refers to the use of numerous small-scale and independently deployed services, instead of encapsulating all functions into one monolith. It has been a challenge in software engineering to decompose a monolithic system into smaller parts. In this paper, we propose the Feature Table approach, a structured approach to service decomposition based on the correlation between functional features and microservices: (1) we defined the concept of Feature Cards and 12 instances of such cards; (2) we formulated Decomposition Rules to decompose monolithic applications; (3) we designed the Feature Table Analysis Tool to provide semi-automatic analysis for identification of microservices; and (4) we formulated Mapping Rules to help developers implement microservice candidates. We performed a case study on Cargo Tracking System to validate our microservice-oriented decomposition approach. Cargo Tracking System is a typical case that has been decomposed by other related methods (dataflow-driven approach, Service Cutter, and API Analysis). Through comparison with the related methods in terms of specific coupling and cohesion metrics, the results show that the proposed Feature Table approach can deliver more reasonable microservice candidates, which are feasible in implementation with semi-automatic support.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are computer trading protocols that require no intermediaries, self-validating, and automatically executing contract terms. In recent years, with the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, they have received considerable attention. Blockchain has the characteristics of distributed, tamperproof, decentralized, and historical traceability, but it is difficult to implement. The introduction of smart contract technology effectively solves this problem. Using blockchain based smart contract technology, encapsulate static contract data, including contract terms agreed upon by all parties, scenarios after contract terms are coded, coping rules, and interaction criteria between the contract and the outside world as specified by the creator, as well as between contracts. This encapsulates all smart contract invocation, execution, and communication rules for a static database of smart contracts. Innovative research on the rapid development technology of blockchain smart contracts provides basic privacy protection support for typical application scenarios of electronic data storage in Information Chain.},

abstract = {Ethereum contracts can be designed to function as fully decentralized applications called DAPPs that hold financial assets, and many have already been fielded. Unfortunately, DAPPs can be hacked, and the assets they control can be stolen. A recent attack on an Ethereum decentralized application called The DAO demonstrated that smart contract bugs are more than an academic concern. Ether worth hundreds of millions of US dollars was extracted by an attacker from The DAO, sending the value of its tokens and the overall exchange price of ether itself tumbling.We present two market-based techniques for insuring the ether holdings of a DAPP. These mechanisms exist and are managed as part of the core programming of the DAPP, rather than as separate mechanisms managed by users. Our first technique is based on futures contracts indexed by the trade price of ether for DAPP tokens. Under fairly general circumstances, our technique is capable of recovering the majority of ether lost from theft with high probability even when all of the ether holdings are stolen; and the only cost to DAPP token holders is an adjustable ether withdrawal fee. As a second, complementary, technique we propose the use of Gated Public Offerings (GPO) as a mechanism that mitigates the effects of attackers that exploit DAPP withdrawal vulnerabilities. We show that using more than one public offering round encourages attackers to exploit the vulnerability early, or depending on certain factors, to delay exploitation (possibly indefinitely) and short tokens in the market instead. In both cases, less ether is ultimately stolen from the DAPP, and in the later case, some of the losses are transferred to the market.},

abstract = {The introduction of novel technology has oftentimes changed the concept of ownership. Non-fungible tokens are a recent example, as they allow a decentralized way to generate and verify proof of ownership via distributed ledger technology. Despite crucial uncertainties, these tokens have generated great enthusiasm for the future of digital property and its surrounding economy. In this regard, I think there is an untapped opportunity in applying a hypertext approach to augment such highly structured ownership-based associations. To this end, in this work I propose hyperownership, based on the premises that property is the law of lists and ledgers, and that hypertext is an apt method to inquiry such a ledger system. In spite of the significant risks and challenges to realize such a vision, I believe that it has great potential to transform the way with which we interact with digital property.},

The “Kyoto Protocol '' of 1997 introduced the need for a mechanism to trade grants issued, allowing the restricted emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and creating an ecosystem for trading the surplus and deficiency of these credits/grants. This study aims at making this trade fraud free by using the powerful features of the blockchain like that of decentralization and a trustless environment by using different smart contracts that operate between multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem, the first contract creates a distributed ledger register for stakeholders, next quantifies CO2 consumptions and mints carbon tokens, third helps in verification of CO2 consumptions and the final contract is a DAO for voting on governance issues. Thus, this work proposes a blockchain based solution for trading of carbon credits to solve the problem of climate change.},

abstract = {In Alibaba, we have seen a growing demand for tracing data flow for scenarios such as data leak detection, change governance, and data consistency checking. Static taint analysis is a technique for such problems, and many approaches are proposed for high scalability and precision. This paper shares our experience in applying taint analysis in Alibaba. In particular, we find that the state-of-the-art taint analysis tool, FlowDroid, does not work well in our cases because our applications make heavy use of libraries, native methods and enterprise-specific frameworks, which impose two major challenges, scalability and implicit dependency, to FlowDroid. This paper presents ANTaint to address these problems. ANTaint improves scalability by expanding the call graph and applying taint propagation on demand for libraries, which account for majority of the program execution but only a small fraction propagates taints. To improve accuracy, we ensure to build a sound call graph with its core part having certain accuracy, and providing a more precise taint propagation model. The practice of applying ANTaint in the company workload validates the idea. According to an experiment on 60 production cases, ANTaint is correct for 95\% of the cases (precision: 95\%, recall: 98\%) while FlowDroid is 13\%. ANTaint takes 65\% less time and none of the cases run out of memory with 32 GB limitation.},

Since 2020, DeFi has started to develop in the cryptocurrency markets. Then, with the increase in popularity of digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and with the launch of the Metaverse, DeFi has been introduced into the Social environment by the combination of social networking and finance in the blockchain. This new shape of DeFi has been called Social Finance (SocialFi). SocialFi can be seen as the social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing to get monetary benefits from being part of SocialFi platforms. In detail, SocialFi has a special feature that is decentralized, open and user-controlled, and it started to be adopted by the communities. The main component of SocialFi is the Social token used to reward people. In this paper, we describe in detail the concept of SocialFi, and we discuss its application on future Social Media platforms.},

Therefore, it should be protected, and awareness needs to be created. Today, in the face of climate change challenges and natural disaster, some of our heritages, linked to natural landscapes, is endangered. This paper describes developing an alternative licensing model for NFTs and a mobile-based NFT marketplace created to promote and protect nature as a heritage in the face of climate change-induced dangers. By incorporating evidence about state-of-the-art, leveraging blockchain and NFTs technologies at the service of heritage, here we highlight two essential and unique aspects: i) ensuring the usage of zero-carbon blockchain solutions and the creation of temporary NFTs, and ii) enabling continuous income sources for the asset owners, in our case organisations devoted to the protection of the designated natural landscapes. In this paper, we describe the design process and the validation of the ideas behind the usage and licensing of zero-carbon temporary NFTs. Thus we propose a financially sustainable solution capable of showing the actual state of the lineage (for example, the changing aspect of a landscape over seasons) and promoting a continuous source of donations used to preserve the assets. We validated the concept with users and obtained good usability and design results, proving the chosen approach’s effectiveness.},

abstract = {Calligraphy is an important part of traditional Chinese culture. Authentic calligraphy works are usually preserved on paper, bamboo slips and stone tablets, which are easy to be destroyed and not easily appreciated by most calligraphy lovers anytime and anywhere. Therefore, in order to facilitate the preservation and appreciation of calligraphy works, digital technology and computer technology are used for digital storage, management and service.The time complexity of image recognition algorithm based on traditional method is relatively high, especially the algorithm based on feature matching has low tolerance to Chinese character deformation. Therefore, this paper tries to use deep learning to study the image recognition of Chinese characters. However, some existing data sets of calligraphic images have a small number of corresponding images, which cannot support deep learning network training. In view of this problem, a data augmentation method based on character glyph and stroke characteristics is proposed. This method starts from two aspects of Chinese character glyph and stroke. Chinese character glyph is changed by affine changes of the restricted conditions. The stroke information of Chinese characters is extracted by super pixel and the stroke information is changed to expand the diversity of Chinese characters in the data set. In the process of character recognition, mixup data augmentation algorithm is combined with Inception v4 network which has excellent performance in Imagenet classification tasks?for network recognition training to improve network generalization ability. Experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper based on deep learning has a higher recognition effect than previous algorithms, especially in cursive and running recognition.The digital calligraphy knowledge service system based on web terminal and WeChat small program terminal is designed and implemented, which can provide the digital calligraphy knowledge service of calligraphy work segmentation and calligraphy character recognition.},

abstract = {Self-Adaptive systems (ASs) are an alternative to get IT professionals free from details of operation and maintenance. Web applications can incorporate characteristics of an AS in order to make them autonomous. However, one of the challenges of software engineering is to transform a legacy system into an AS. Furthermore, transforming a legacy system into an AS can lead to the insertion of faults. This way, the code coverage information produced by software tests assist in activities related to the evolutionary maintenance of the system. In this work, we analyzed, through the comparison of coverage metrics, how the introduction of adaptive behaviors in a real world legacy web application impacted on code coverage. For each implemented scenario, a set of test cases was created in the legacy version of the web application. Then, evolutionary versions were developed with the introduction of adaptive behavior. The versions (legacy and adaptive) were organized into branches of the version control system so that adaptive implementations have evolved in two technological ways. The coverage metrics for each version of the web application were collected to allow data analysis. Beyond the legacy version, we analyzed the coverage of six versions of the web application with adaptive behavior. The results indicate that the impact on the total code coverage is relevant, where even relatively small changes can considerably affect, either positively or negatively, the percentage of coverage of the changed unit.},

abstract = {The growing popularity of online social media (OSM) has led to the creation of a wide amount of social media platforms. In this context, the increasing competition among platforms and the emergence of decentralized alternatives such as Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM), have led to more frequent user migrations: individuals tend to switch platforms in search of improved features, content, or communities. Therefore there has been increasing interest in user migration studies modeling and predicting user migration. However, user migration, especially in blockchain-based platforms remains an understudied problem. Existing methods rely on user activity to derive interaction graphs and then address the user migration prediction problem as a node classification task, where user decisions are encoded as node labels. While the performance look promising, there are currently two important research gaps: i) there is no work using graph neural networks, the state-of-the-art in machine learning on graphs; and ii) there is a lack of methods designed to improve prediction performance in the case of class imbalance, i.e. the presence of dominant behavior among the ones to predict. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict user migration in BOSM. We model the data as a directed temporal multilayer graph, capturing social and monetary interactions among users. To address the problem of class imbalance in node classification, we introduce a data-level balancing technique following an undersampling approach. The evaluation, conducted on data describing user migration across blockchain online social media platforms, shows that graph neural networks are a suitable machine learning approach to perform user migration prediction. Furthermore, the proposed undersampling approach improves predictive power on severely imbalanced data. These results highlight how graph neural networks are effective in predicting user migration, without the need for manual feature engineering and in the absence of user information. Our methodology holds potential for applications beyond user migration, such as fraud detection and bot detection, and opens up venues for further research in other prediction tasks in online social networks and blockchain-based systems.},

These systems aim at empowering the local economies by virtue of a medium of exchange whose governance and circulation are local. Smart contracts enable the enforcement of token economy policies, which facilitate the experimentation of radically new economic models. Recent studies investigated blockchain-based CCSs. Still, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing a CCS providing a token-based Universal Basic Income (UBI). We evaluate the Circles UBI decentralised application utility in delivering an unconditional income to its users, focusing on its main pilot project running in Berlin. We analyse the structural changes in the network, especially in relation to a subsidy program, involving local businesses. We also identify prominent users based on centrality measures, and investigate how the UBI was effectively spent. We adopt a method agnostic to the economic context to identify optimal aggregation windows for the temporal network of CCS transactions based on the Causal Fidelity (CF) index. This aims to provide static representations as accurate as possible in terms of sequential order of edges, which aspect was not considered in previous research on CCSs.

abstract = {In response to diverse perspectives on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), ranging from potential safety and ethical concerns to more extreme views about the threats it poses to humanity, this research presents a generic method to gauge the reasoning capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models as a foundational step in evaluating safety measures. Recognizing that AI reasoning measures cannot be wholly automated, due to factors such as cultural complexity, we conducted an extensive examination of five commercial Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), focusing on their comprehension and interpretation of culturally intricate contexts. Utilizing our novel “Reasoning and Value Alignment Test”, we assessed the GPT models’ ability to reason in complex situations and grasp local cultural subtleties. Our findings have indicated that, although the models have exhibited high levels of human-like reasoning, significant limitations remained, especially concerning the interpretation of cultural contexts. This paper also explored potential applications and use-cases of our Test, underlining its significance in AI training, ethics compliance, sensitivity auditing, and AI-driven cultural consultation. We concluded by emphasizing its broader implications in the AGI domain, highlighting the necessity for interdisciplinary approaches, wider accessibility to various GPT models, and a profound understanding of the interplay between GPT reasoning and cultural sensitivity.},

abstract = {This paper presents a crypto Non Fungible Token (NFT) for real estate information. Current issues with real estate are the lack of asset information availability, and once data is retrieved, its veracity. Moreover, data can be out of data or artificially manipulated for an economic benefit. An example could be the fire alarm inspection logs. On the other hand, the main benefits of tokenisation are 1) decentralisation from a single source of authority, 2) encryption of data that avoids tampering, and 3) digital proof of ownership. The NFT registers real estate static and dynamic information to be traded in the data marketplace between the different users and stakeholders such as investors, occupiers, insurers and property managers. The information registered in the NFT contains real estate deeds, transactions and relevant parameters that change over time. The infrastructure of the proposed real estate NFT consists of a private token in a private blockchain entirely developed for this application rather than ERC-1155 or ERC-721; therefore, a new crypto token is created. Furthermore, the consensus protocol is a mixture between the proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms by choosing random validators with staked Cryptocurrency already, such as Ethereum. Experimental results show that the increment of the NFT at every transaction does not produce an equal increment of mining time or mining nonce, making the NFT predictable for higher complex models.},

abstract = {Callbacks are essential in many programming environments, but drastically complicate program understanding and reasoning because they allow to mutate object's local states by external objects in unexpected fashions, thus breaking modularity. The famous DAO bug in the cryptocurrency framework Ethereum, employed callbacks to steal $150M. We define the notion of Effectively Callback Free (ECF) objects in order to allow callbacks without preventing modular reasoning.  An object is ECF in a given execution trace if there exists an equivalent execution trace without callbacks to this object. An object is ECF if it is ECF in every possible execution trace. We study the decidability of dynamically checking ECF in a given execution trace and statically checking if an object is ECF. We also show that dynamically checking ECF in Ethereum is feasible and can be done online. By running the history of all execution traces in Ethereum, we were able to verify that virtually all existing contract executions, excluding these of the DAO or of contracts with similar known vulnerabilities, are ECF. Finally, we show that ECF, whether it is verified dynamically or statically, enables modular reasoning about objects with encapsulated state.},

abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) or blockchains have been steadily emerging and providing innovation in the past decade for several use cases, ranging from financial networks, to notarization, or trustworthy execution via smart contracts. DLTs are enticing due to their properties of decentralization, non-repudiation, and auditability (transparency). These properties are of high potential to access control systems that can be implemented on-chain, and are executed without infringement and full transparency.While it remains uncertain which use cases will truly turn out to be viable, many use cases such as financial transactions can benefit from integrating certain restrictions via access control on the blockchain. In addition, smart contracts may in the future present security risks that are currently yet unknown. As a solution, access control policies can provide flexibility in the execution flow when adopted by smart contracts.In this paper, we present our DEDACS architecture which provides decentralized and dynamic access control for smart contracts in a policy-based manner. Our access control is expressive as it features policies, and dynamic as the environment or users can be changed, or alternative policies can be assigned to smart contracts. DEDACS ensures that our access control preserves the desired properties of decentralization and transparency, while aiming to keep the costs involved as minimal as possible. We have evaluated DEDACS in the context of a Uniswap token-exchange platform, in which we evaluated the costs related to (i) the introduced overhead at deployment time and (ii) the operational overhead cost. DEDACS introduces a relative overhead of on average 52\% at deployment time, and an operational overhead between 52\% and 80\% depending on the chosen policy and its complexity.},

abstract = {Blockchain and smart contracts are one of the key technologies promoting Web 3.0. However, due to security considerations and consistency requirements, smart contracts currently only support simple and deterministic programs, which significantly hinders their deployment in intelligent Web 3.0 applications. To enhance smart contracts intelligence on the blockchain, we propose SMART, a plug-in smart contract framework that supports efficient AI model inference while being compatible with existing blockchains. To handle the high complexity of model inference, we propose an on-chain and off-chain joint execution model, which separates the SMART contract into two parts: the deterministic code still runs inside an on-chain virtual machine, while the complex model inference is offloaded to off-chain compute nodes. To solve the non-determinism brought by model inference, we leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to endorse the integrity and correctness of the off-chain execution. We also design distributed attestation and secret key provisioning schemes to further enhance the system security and model privacy. We implement a SMART prototype and evaluate it on a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchain. Theoretical analysis and prototype evaluation show that SMART not only achieves the security goals of correctness, liveness, and model privacy, but also has approximately 5 orders of magnitude faster inference efficiency than existing on-chain solutions.},

However, their use is also associated with predatory trading and market manipulation, and can pose threats to system integrity. It is therefore essential to understand the extent of bot deployment in DLTs; despite this, current detection systems are predominantly rule-based and lack flexibility. In this study, we present a novel approach that utilizes machine learning for the detection of financial bots on the Ethereum platform. First, we systematize existing scientific literature and collect anecdotal evidence to establish a taxonomy for financial bots, comprising 7 categories and 24 subcategories. Next, we create a ground-truth dataset consisting of 133 human and 137 bot addresses. Third, we employ both unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to detect bots deployed on Ethereum. The highest-performing clustering algorithm is a Gaussian Mixture Model with an average cluster purity of 82.6\%, while the highest-performing model for binary classification is a Random Forest with an accuracy of 83\%. Our machine learning-based detection mechanism contributes to understanding the Ethereum ecosystem dynamics by providing additional insights into the current bot landscape.},

Nevertheless, the phenomenon is relevant to HCI, and signifies important developments for future interactive products. To better understand the NFT phenomenon, and to inform future HCI research and design, we investigated the stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem and relations between them. Based on open data we mined from the social news website Hacker News, we contribute the first data-backed model of stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem.
