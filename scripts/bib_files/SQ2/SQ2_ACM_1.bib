abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a new paradigm to build decentralized systems which do not require a central authority. It is most popular for enabling Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. However, blockchain applications span beyond Finance, and recently it has been applied to decentralized governance. Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer. We will illustrate its potential with the case of the DAO Genesis Alpha, which is the main DAO of the DAOstack project.},

Even though such communities become more popular and influential, their governance capabilities are still limited and lacking in quality. We argue that the MAS community holds the keys to improving the governance capabilities of DAOs; and that the challenge of DAO governance constitutes an important, new application area for MAS research that has the potential to have both scientific and societal impacts. Concretely, we describe DAOs and their governance needs and highlight gaps between the state of the art of MAS research and the governance needs of DAOs.},

abstract = {This piece explores algorithmic governance as a strength and a vulnerability in the experience of building participatory communities known as "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations". The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation and built cryptographically secure blockchain-based infrastructure to counter this threat. Now, not just on chain transactions are being tracked but every move of participants in blockchain communities. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if mis-used for social control. This piece analyzes the ways in which decentralization efforts can be a threat to themselves by exploring the question, 'Are "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) the next panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in "autonomous" systems?'. By employing ethnographic methods and case study analysis, this piece provides an important qualitative contribution to the early dynamics of the aspirations and problems of decentralized, autonomous organizations.},

abstract = {Blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are systems for transacting and storing value by automatically executing a function without the need for trusted, centralized authorities. Participative budgeting requires voting about budget allocation by communities and is often confronted with issues in trust and transparency. Yet, DAOs are hardly used for participative budgeting. In this research, we introduce Decentralized Autonomous Citizen Participation Organizations (DACPOs). In a DACPO, data and actions are recorded and autonomously executed in a decentralized way. DACPOs can be used for enabling participative budgeting and thereby provide transparency, decrease the risks of fraud and corruption, and increase citizens’ trust. The viability of DACPOs depends on a number of factors, including a minimum number of citizens who participate. In further research, factors influencing the use of DACPOs for participative budgeting can be further analyzed and tested.},

abstract = {The emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represents a paradigm shift in the organizational structure enabled by distributed digital ledger technologies such as blockchain. Exclusively digital web-based entities, DAOs function independently through blockchain-based smart contracts that rely on distributed governance, community coordination, and incentive mechanisms rather than top-down hierarchies. As DAOs continue to foster an environment conducive to a new class of digital participants, they are becoming increasingly prominent in the digital cryptocurrency economy, raising questions regarding their structure, sustainability, and adoption. Being collectively owned and managed by their members, DAOs exhibit characteristics of both non-zero and zero-sum dynamics, thereby posing a challenge to conventional centralized and hierarchical management models. This mixed-methods study examines DAOs within modern information ecosystems through a literature review, blockchain analysis, and comparative organizational analysis. The literature review synthesizes academic discourse on DAOs, highlighting key theories, such as decentralization, digital governance, and distributed decision-making. Blockchain analysis of 10 leading DAOs provides engagement and activity metrics. Comparative analysis considers the DAOs’ advantages and challenges in relation to traditional centralized organizations, focusing on aspects such as governance, efficiency, and adaptability. The findings reveal DAOs' innovative potential and adoption barriers, such as reliance on token incentives and difficulties with coordinated decision-making due to reasons like concentration of voting power and others. Although DAOs possess advantages in terms of decentralization, community alignment, and transparent algorithmic execution, traditional organizations currently maintain superiority in terms of stability and legal standing. This study provides an interdisciplinary academic perspective on the concept and implementation of the DAO by combining conceptual understanding, empirical blockchain evidence, and comparative analysis. It is concluded that realizing the transformative potential of DAOs requires synthesizing multidisciplinary insights and overcoming substantive adoption hurdles. The proposed framework serves as a foundation for further research on the evolution and integration of DAOs into organizations of the future.},

abstract = {Recent blockchain-technology related innovations enable the governance of collaborating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to engage in agile business-network collaborations that are based on the novel concept of smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely coupled collaboration lifecycle with the main steps of setup, enactment, possible rollbacks and finally, an orderly termination. This lifecycle supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs, smart contract negotiations, and behavior monitoring during enactment with the potential for breach management. Based on a sound understanding of the collaboration lifecycle in a Governance- as-a-Service (GaaS)-platform, a new type of conflict management must safeguard business-semantics induced consistency rules. This conflict management involves breach detection with recovery aspects. To fill the detected gap, we employ a formal design-notation that comprises the definition of structural and behavioral properties for exploring conflict-related exception- and compensation management during a decentralized collaboration. With the formal approach, we generate a highly dependable DAO-GaaS conflict model that does not collapse under left-behind clutter such as orphaned processes and exponentially growing database entries that require an unacceptable periodic GaaS reset.},

Blockchain allows different communities to create Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), which are self-organised democratic organisations controlled by smart contracts. This paper presents a new DAO model for the procurement of services by public organisations, such as government agencies. To demonstrate the advantages of this solution, this work looks specifically at current public procurement systems that resort to third-party contractors that manage these negotiations. Third parties lack the transparency, security, and democratic representation that a DAO can provide. We present the implementation of a DAO as a set of smart contracts executed on Ethereum-compatible permissionless blockchains, supported by a consensus algorithm, replacing third-party contractors.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has enabled a thriving emergent ecosystem of tools and communities actively using decentralized systems. However, most blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum) requires users to pay some fees to execute their desired actions in these novel online services. To which extent an increase in the price of such fees negatively affects user activity? Would significant price surges deter users from using blockchain-enabled online services? In this work, we study the 2020 surge of transaction fee price in the Ethereum network, and analyze how that affected user activities. Our use cases are the blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from the platforms DAOstack and DAOhaus. Thus, we analyzed 5,580 transactions from 7,825 users grouped in 191 DAO communities, using a VAR model with a daily time series of the average fee value and the DAO operations. Our results show just a minor influence of the fee (gas) price and the activity of DAO users. The insensitivity of the activity to the fee price is an anomaly in a supposedly self-regulated market, and we consider this should be tackled in future implementations.},

abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms are often governed by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which are implemented via governance protocols. Governance tokens are distributed to users of the platform, granting them voting rights in the platform's governance protocol.Many DeFi platforms have already been subject to attacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.  In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.  We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.},

One of the main applications of smart contracts are the so called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), which originated from an idea envisaged by Buterin, in his Ethereum white paper. Indeed, DAOs are decentralized organizations, where the members implement their decisions using smart contracts. In the article, we introduce a simple framework for a DAO, and then we discuss some governance issues. In particular, we focus on how DAO members could be induced to dedicate sufficient time to voting sessions, for a proper functioning of the organization. Indeed, recent empirical research suggests how the members’ participation rate, to voting activities, has a meaningful positive correlation with to a DAO's performance. More specifically, we formalize the notion of attention time and propose a simple model for the so-called Holographic Consensus, a protocol introduced by the DAOStack platform to solve the issue of limited time dedicated to governance, discussing under what conditions DAO members may choose the so-called boosting voting procedure.},

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

abstract = {Remote voting has become more critical in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. Blockchain technology and its benefits such as decentralization, security, and transparency have given rise to proposals for blockchain-based voting systems. However, the traceability of blockchain transactions violates voter anonymity in existing proposals. Besides, transaction costs also need to be considered. Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89\% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at .},

This study proposes a novel analysis of how these instruments can affect the fundamental assumption on the role of organisations, either private or public, as a mechanism for the coordination of labour. We propose that these technologies can fundamentally affect: (i) the distribution of rewards within an organisation and (ii) the structure of its transaction costs. These changes bring the potential for addressing some of the trade-offs between the private and public sectors.},

abstract = {In the past, the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)” was used to refer to a loosely organized network of autonomous entities, such as a corporation, a cooperative, or a non-profit party. Since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs. The EVM can also run other applications such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a new type of blcokchain-based organization that uses smart contracts to perform tasks on a distributed scale. The smart contracts have organizational rules and operational logic embedded and automatically execute organizational decisions and proposals making it highly decentralized and more democratic. The DAOs are organizations that are not subject to legal, physical, or economic constraints, as well as the ability to operate outside the control of a single central authority or a single governing body. Because DAO is formed by many smart contract that operate together, which makes it highly decentralized and has a strong democratic system. This paper discusses the pros and cons of DAO, and the potential of DAO in community development, especially in non-profit organizations. It is hope to provide an overall picture of DAO, and the roadmap for future development of DAO on the right track.},

abstract = {Sociotechnical imaginaries are futures that people envision might be possible and desirable. They have a real impact on how systems are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

abstract = {Connected autonomous vehicles technology is expected to be an important component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the help of artificial intelligence, cognitive methods, software-hardware and sensor platforms, several relevant industry standards are being developed to enable connected vehicles. One significant challenge raised by connected vehicles is how the underlying communication infrastructure will be able to efficiently support them. In this article, we propose the Dynamic, Decentralized, Distributed, Delegation-based (D4) network control plane architecture, which aims at providing adequate communication support for connected vehicles. To our knowledge, D4 is the first framework to support on-demand network control decentralization. At its core, D4’s flexible network control delegation framework allows network control to be dynamically distributed on demand to address quality-of-service requirements of different connected vehicle services and applications. We demonstrate the benefits of D4 through a proof-of-concept prototype running on a fully reproducible emulation platform. Experimental results using a variety of real-world scenarios demonstrate that D4 delivers lower latency with minimal additional overhead. We also showcase the benefits of D4 when compared to traditional vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) approaches.},

abstract = {Self-organizing multi-agent systems provide a suitable paradigm for developing autonomic computing systems that manage themselves. Towards this goal, we demonstrate a robust, decentralized approach for structural adaptation in explicitly modeled problem solving agent organizations. Based on self-organization principles, our method enables the autonomous agents to modify their structural relations to achieve a better allocation of tasks in a simulated task-solving environment. Specifically, the agents reason about when and how to adapt using only their history of interactions as guidance. We empirically show that, in a wide range of closed, open, static, and dynamic scenarios, the performance of organizations using our method is close (70–90\%) to that of an idealized centralized allocation method and is considerably better (10–60\%) than the current state-of-the-art decentralized approaches.},

abstract = {Recently, a new generation of P2P systems capable of addressing data integrity and authenticity has emerged for the development of new applications for a "more" decentralized Internet, i.e., Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and Decentralized File Systems (DFS). However, these technologies still have some unanswered issues, mostly related to data lookup and discovery. In this paper, first, we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system that efficiently manages decentralized keyword-based queries executed on data stored in DFS. Through a hypercube logical layout, queries are efficiently routed among the network, where each node is responsible for a specific keywords set and the related contents. Second, we provide a framework for the governance of the above network, based on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implementation. We show how the use of smart contracts enables organizational decision making and rewards for nodes that have actively contributed to the DHT. Finally, we provide experimental validation of an implementation of our proposal, where the execution of the same protocol for different logical nodes of the hypercube allows us to evaluate the efficiency of communication within the network.},

Previous work has shown that hierarchically organizational control is an effective way of coordinating DRL to improve its speed, quality, and likelihood of convergence. In this paper, we develop a distributed, negotiation-based approach to dynamically forming such hierarchical organizations. To reduce the complexity of coordinating DRL, our self-organization approach groups strongly-interacting learning agents together, whose exploration strategies are coordinated by one supervisor. We formalize this idea by characterizing interactions among agents in a decentralized Markov Decision Process model and defining and analyzing a measure that explicitly captures the strength of such interactions. Experimental results show that our dynamically evolving organizations outperform predefined organizations for coordinating DRL.},

We consider the problem of improving the throughput of a scaled model of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge: a two-stage bottleneck where four lanes reduce to two and then reduce to one. Although there is extensive work examining variants of bottleneck control in a centralized setting, there is less study of the challenging multi-agent setting where the large number of interacting AVs leads to significant optimization difficulties for reinforcement learning methods. We apply multi-agent reinforcement algorithms to this problem and demonstrate that significant improvements in bottleneck throughput, from 20\% at a 5\% penetration rate to 33\% at a 40\% penetration rate, can be achieved. We compare our results to a hand-designed feedback controller and demonstrate that our results sharply outperform the feedback controller despite extensive tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RL-based controllers adopt a robust strategy that works across penetration rates whereas the feedback controllers degrade immediately upon penetration rate variation. We investigate the feasibility of both action and observation decentralization and demonstrate that effective strategies are possible using purely local sensing.

abstract = {The emergence of new technologies and software engineering methodologies in the decentralised Web, referred to as Web 3.0, often requires using new approaches to supplement conventional development concepts such as object-oriented programming and design patterns. Therefore, it is essential to understand the blockchain fundamentals and modular development of distributed systems built from multiple components. This paper proposes a project-oriented teaching approach of smart contracts-based distributed applications (dApps) integrated into existing (Web 2.0) Web applications. First, we present the main overview of the Web programming course for a bachelor study program, prior knowledge requirements, and the characteristics of the lectures. Second, we define the dApp functional requirements for student projects that intend to consolidate the dApp theoretical concepts with a practical approach to complement the Web 3.0 concepts. The study of our teaching approach is based on an experiment where we thoroughly analyse performance on the course level, projects and individual students. The results indicate a high correlation between students' performance in Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 development, and a higher degree of iterative process is also associated with better-performing students. Moreover, the student project outcomes also provide a basis for possible future course improvements.},

Soulbound tokens add an important piece to blockchain technology, as they could be the key to building Web3 and a trustworthy decentralized society. Issued and strictly linked to an account, representing the soul of a user, the soulbound token makes it possible to represent a property that only the user can have and that cannot be transferred, but only removed, which enhances security. To evaluate their impact on blockchain development, we first examine the concept of soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their effective adoption. The application sectors include the creation of digital identity certificates, ownership certificates, reputational certificates, governance, and the healthcare sector. We then report and describe relevant blockchain token standards, including soulbound token standards, provided in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Finally, to study the efficacy of the implementation of soulbound tokens, we propose a case study that includes the design and development of a decentralized vaccine certification prototype based on soulbound tokens. In our system, the vaccination data produced by the health authority is fully decentralized and implemented as the issuance of soulbound tokens for the benefit of a citizen's soul account. As a result, the citizen is the only owner of the vaccination data.},

Even though it is the most efficient, central control requires fully automated connected vehicles, active vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, which introduces inherent security, privacy and feasibility issues. We simulate autonomous intelligent vehicles making local access decisions at isolated intersections, with only sensing and/or beacon information. The simulation proves to be collision-free. The extended management model is now able to account for various vehicle classes, all possible turns at the intersection and safe turning speeds. Compared to a standard signal controller, the proposed and improved model is again proven to be operationally more efficient.},

abstract = {In service-oriented environments and distributed systems, service composition allows simple services to be dynamically combined into new, more complex services. Service composition techniques are usually designed as an extension to service discovery. Traditional techniques try to match a user’s requirements, often complex, with the available services. However, one-to-one matching is inefficient; it is preferable to meet the request from available services even when one of the basic services is not present. Separating composition and discovery has also led to inefficiency, especially in a highly dynamic environment. With the heterogeneity of networks, users, and applications having multiple sources, constructing service-specific overlays in large distributed networks is challenging. In this article, we propose a new service composition algorithm to deal with the problem of composing multiple autonomic elements to achieve system-wide goals. Using a self-organizing approach, autonomic entities are dynamically and seamlessly composed into service-specific overlay networks. The algorithm combines composition and service discovery into one step, thereby achieving more efficiency and less latency. The decentralized and self-organizing nature of the algorithm allows it to respond rapidly to system changes. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the approach when it is compared to other solutions.},

abstract = {Multi-agent systems can be viewed as organisations of individual agents. Designing an agent organisation is a complex process involving defining the structural relationships among agents, the lines of inter-agent communication, and the agent functionality. Existing approaches to agent organisation design are difficult to apply in practice since they require designers to make decisions while working at a low level of abstraction.This paper contributes towards designing agent organisations in a practical and effective manner by proposing to semi-automate the organisational design process. The proposed semi-automatic approach enables agent system designers to reason at a high abstraction level and conveniently re-use previous design decisions. This semi-automatic approach to agent organisation design uses role modelling and a role algebra which captures a number of basic relations among roles. The role algebra's semantics are formally defined using a two-sorted algebra.The applicability of the semi-automatic agent organisation design approach is demonstrated by an example drawn from a case study involving telephone repair service teams.},

abstract = {As the blockchain landscape evolves, the emergence of diverse blockchain platforms designed for specific use cases provides an opportunity to combine their strengths. One way to take advantage on this is to compose specialized services across multiple heterogeneous blockchains. Just as microservices revolutionized cloud platforms, decentralized service composition can similarly transform the way blockchain-based software systems are developped and unlock new use case.This early-stage paper presents an initial Ph.D. research proposal on decentralized service composition applications (dXapps) as a new blockchain application paradigm to address this need. dXapps allow practitioners to combine modular blockchain services, leveraging different chains based on suitability, into integrated applications.},

abstract = {As various smart services are increasingly deployed in modern cities, many unexpected conflicts arise due to various physical world couplings. Existing solutions for conflict resolution often rely on centralized control to enforce predetermined and fixed priorities of different services, which is challenging due to the inconsistent and private objectives of the services. Also, the centralized solutions miss opportunities to more effectively resolve conflicts according to their spatiotemporal locality of the conflicts. To address this issue, we design a decentralized negotiation and conflict resolution framework named DeResolver, which allows services to resolve conflicts by communicating and negotiating with each other to reach a Pareto-optimal agreement autonomously and efficiently. Our design features a two-step self-supervised learning-based algorithm to predict acceptable proposals and their rankings of each opponent through the negotiation. Our design is evaluated with a smart city case study of three services: intelligent traffic light control, pedestrian service, and environmental control. In this case study, a data-driven evaluation is conducted using a large dataset consisting of the GPS locations of 246 surveillance cameras and an automatic traffic monitoring system with more than 3 million records per day to extract real-world vehicle routes. The evaluation results show that our solution achieves much more balanced results, i.e.,&nbsp;only increasing the average waiting time of vehicles, the measurement metric of intelligent traffic light control service, by 6.8\% while reducing the weighted sum of air pollutant emission, measured for environment control service, by 12.1\%, and the pedestrian waiting time, the measurement metric of pedestrian service, by 33.1\%, compared to priority-based solution.},

abstract = {Network applications are increasingly required to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive to dynamic changes in the network, and survivable against partial system failures. Based on the observation that various biological systems have already satisfied these requirements, this article proposes and evaluates a biologically-inspired framework that makes network applications to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive, and survivable. With the proposed framework, called iNet, each network application is designed as a decentralized group of software agents, analogous to a bee colony (application) consisting of multiple bees (agents). Each agent provides a particular functionality of a network application, and implements biological behaviors such as reproduction, migration, energy exchange, and death. iNet is designed after the mechanisms behind how the immune system detects antigens (e.g., viruses) and produces specific antibodies to eliminate them. It models a set of environment conditions (e.g., network traffic and resource availability) as an antigen and an agent behavior (e.g., migration) as an antibody. iNet allows each agent to autonomously sense its surrounding environment conditions (an antigen) to evaluate whether it adapts well to the sensed environment, and if it does not, adaptively perform a behavior (an antibody) suitable for the environment conditions. In iNet, a configuration of antibodies is encoded as a set of genes, and antibodies evolve via genetic operations such as crossover and mutation. Empirical measurement results show that iNet is lightweight enough. Simulation results show that agents adapt to dynamic and heterogeneous network environments by evolving their antibodies across generations. The results also show that iNet allows agents to scale to workload volume and network size and to survive partial link failures in the network.},

abstract = {Dynamic resource provisioning aims at maintaining the end-to-end response time of a web application within a pre-defined SLA. Although the topic has been well studied for monolithic applications, provisioning resources for applications composed of multiple services remains a challenge. When the SLA is violated, one must decide which service(s) should be reprovisioned for optimal effect. We propose to assign an SLA only to the front-end service. Other services are not given any particular response time objectives. Services are autonomously responsible for their own provisioning operations and collaboratively negotiate performance objectives with each other to decide the provisioning service(s). We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our system can add/remove/shift both servers and caches within an entire multi-service application under varying workloads to meet the SLA target and improve resource utilization.},

Constructing a decentralized application involves designing agents as independent local computations that coordinate to realize the application's requirements. Moreover, a decentralized application is susceptible to faults manifested as message loss, delay, and reordering.We contribute Mandrake, a programming model for decentralized applications that addresses these challenges. Specifically, we adopt the construct of an information protocol that specifies messaging between agents purely in causal terms and can be correctly enacted by agents in a shared-nothing environment over nothing more than unreliable, unordered transport. Mandrake facilitates: implementing protocol-compliant agents by introducing a programming model; transforming fragile protocols into fault-tolerant ones with simple annotations; and a declarative policy language that makes it easy to implement fault-tolerance in agents based on the capabilities in protocols. In obviating the reliance on reliability and ordering guarantees in the communication infrastructure, Mandrake achieves some of the goals of the founders of networked computing from the 1970s.},

abstract = {This study examines software metrics in decentralized applications (dApps) to analyze their structural and behavioral characteristics as they grow in complexity. Sixty dApps were categorized into Small (3 to 29 contracts), Medium (30 to 46 contracts), and Large (47 to 206 contracts) based on their contract count. Initial analysis showed a non-normal data distribution, leading to the use of Spearman's correlation method. Findings revealed that Medium dApps have strong correlations between metrics like 'Average Local Variables' and 'Maximum Local Variables', while Large dApps show higher correlations between 'Number of Functions' and 'State Variable Count', indicating more complex contract structures. The higher Coupling Between Objects (CBO) in large dApps suggests increased interactions with other contracts or libraries, potentially elevating security risks. These insights are valuable for developers and stakeholders in the blockchain and IoT sectors, aiding in understanding how dApps evolve with increasing complexity and the implications on software metric relationships.},

Shared service centers (SSCs) are gaining importance in public administration as a means to innovate, to reduce costs and to increase service levels. The SSC is a business model in which selected government functions are concentrated into a semi-autonomous business unit. Implementing SSCs is not easy, as it often requires several trade-offs and an effective organization and management structure.The discussions about the decision whether to use SSCs seem to be predominantly focused on efficiency and effectiveness aspects, which are rational arguments. In this research-in-progress ongoing research into the design and governance of SSC is presented. We analyze a case study at a municipality and identify factors contributing to success and failure. Our preliminary findings suggest that designing an effective management structure, establishing an architecture capturing central and decentral elements, setting the right expectations, creating a sense of urgency and ensuring that all stakeholders understand the centralization/decentralization aspects of the SSC are important elements resulting in success.},

abstract = {Today's distributed applications such as sensor networks, mobile multimedia applications, and intelligent transportation systems pose huge engineering challenges. Such systems often comprise different components that interact with each other as peers, as such forming a decentralized system. The system components and collaborations change over time, often in unanticipated ways. Multiagent systems belong to a class of decentralized systems that are known for realizing qualities such as adaptability, robustness, and scalability in such environments. A typical way to structure and manage interactions among agents is by means of organizations. Existing approaches usually endow agents with a dual responsibility: on the one hand agents have to play roles providing the associated functionality in the organization, on the other hand agents are responsible for setting up organizations and managing organization dynamics. Engineering realistic multiagent systems in which agents encapsulate this dual responsibility is a complex task.In this article, we present an organization model for context-driven dynamic agent organizations. The model defines abstractions that support application developers to describe dynamic organizations. The organization model is part of an integrated approach, called MACODO: Middleware Architecture for COntext-driven Dynamic agent Organizations. The complementary part of the MACODO approach is a middleware platform that supports the distributed execution of dynamic organizations specified using the abstractions, as described in Weyns et al. [2009].In the model, the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations is separated from the agents: organizations are first-class citizens, and their dynamics are governed by laws. The laws specify how changes in the system (e.g., an agent joins an organization) and changes in the context (e.g., information observed in the environment) lead to dynamic reorganizations. As such, the model makes it easier to understand and specify dynamic organizations in multiagent systems, and promotes reusing the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations. The organization model is formally described to specify the semantics of the abstractions, and ensure its type safety. We apply the organization model to specify dynamic organizations for a traffic monitoring application.},
