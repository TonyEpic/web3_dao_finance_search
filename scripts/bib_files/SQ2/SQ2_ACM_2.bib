abstract = {Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.},

abstract = {IT artifacts and systems increasingly act autonomously and interact non-deterministically, and we have not yet learned how to deal with this empowerment of machine agency in digital government. Following the sociomateriality discourse, this research unfolds a perspective from which digital government research can understand the intertwinement of human action and technology performance while designing and shaping the upcoming digitalization of government operations. This perspective assumes an intended primacy of the people in the citizen−government relationship and perceives the marginalization of humans as a significant threat to applying social values in governance, especially when situated action is required. Using Mintzberg's models of managing government, we identify a variety of ‘monster’ challenges, point to opportunities for decomposition of human and machine agency and advocate the alignment and composition of both agencies as a long-term learning process that involves both citizens and technology and requires safeguarding by multiple stakeholders.},

abstract = {Driven by the 'nuclear high base' project, the autonomous new key software and hardware technology has made great breakthroughs. After adaptation, testing and evaluation, there are already some basic software and hardware computing environments with high availability, but the performance and reliability are far from the traditional computing environments. In order to make the application system effective and reliable in the autonomic controllable computing environment, this paper studies the application cluster architecture in the autonomic controllable computing environment, and proposes a cluster architecture that can extend the application nodes on demand. It breaks through the key technical issues of session sharing, transaction processing, task execution and service distribution involved in the architecture, realizes the load balancing of user requests, improves the overall response speed of the application, and users can access the application as long as any application service is not down, thus improving the overall reliability of the application. After the cluster validation of the electronic conference system, the performance and reliability of the system are improved obviously, and the application service nodes can be extended freely according to the number of users and handling capacity.},

abstract = {This paper presents an innovative approach to predicting near-miss accidents, vital for proactive accident prevention. Leveraging dashcam footage and weather sensor data, our model integrates camera calibration, collision point prediction, heuristic knowledge, and analysis of near-miss accident patterns. We propose a comprehensive method to detect and predict potential collisions within the ego-vehicle's safe zone, utilizing a combination of machine learning techniques including DeepHough, YOLOv8, and LSTM. Furthermore, we introduce heuristic rules to handle sudden changes in object behavior and enhance object detection accuracy under challenging conditions like low visibility. Our approach identifies common near-miss accident patterns and achieves a prediction accuracy of 96.01\% with support from hard brake detection. Comparative analysis demonstrates the superior performance of our method against existing benchmarks. Moreover, our lightweight model is designed for deployment on edge clients, ensuring real-time assistance to drivers. Collaboratively developed with government and industry stakeholders, our approach contributes to creating cost-effective smart driving assistance systems with wide-ranging applications in traffic safety and accident analysis.},

abstract = {For years traditional learning approaches have been applied in schools and universities, where teachers are considered the knowledge center, leaving students as secondary actors of learning processes. In order to investigate new learning methodologies a set of new approaches have been tried. Challenge Based Learning (CBL) is one of these proposals, created with the essential principles of a 21st century learning environment in mind. Since 2014, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) have applied such methodology in the context whose multidisciplinary students from different courses learn to develop mobile apps, and work together looking for solutions that can impact lives. This paper presents how CBL was applied for two student groups, mentioning learned lessons and changes performed in the learning process from these lessons.},

abstract = {Background: Unhandled exceptions affect the reliability of web applications. Several studies have measured the reliability of web applications in use against unhandled exceptions, showing a recurrence of the problem during the maintenance phase. Detecting latent unhandled exceptions automatically is difficult and application-specific. Hence, general approaches to deal with defects in web applications do not treat unhandled exceptions appropriately. Aims: To design and evaluate a method that can support finding, correcting, and preventing unhandled exceptions in web applications. Method: We applied the design science engineering cycle to design a method called Pattern-Driven Maintenance (PDM). PDM relies on identifying defect patterns based on application server logs and producing static analysis rules that can be used for prevention. We applied PDM to two industrial web applications involving different companies and technologies, measuring the reliability improvement and the precision of the produced static analysis rules. Results: In both cases, our approach allowed identifying defect patterns and finding latent unhandled exceptions to be fixed in the source code, enabling to completely eliminate the pattern-related failures and improving the application reliability. The static analysis rules produced by PDM achieved a precision of 59-68\% in the first application and 89-100\% in the second, where lessons learnt from the first evaluation were addressed. Conclusions: The results strengthen our confidence that PDM can help maintainers to improve the reliability for unhandled exceptions in other existing web applications.},

The web application was developed based on MVC architectural pattern by using JavaServer Pages as a frontend development language, Java Servlet as a backend controller and MySQL as a database engine management system. According to an automated test done by JMeter, the throughput of the backend controller with Flyweight design pattern was more than the common controller. The result means that the Flyweight pattern supports more requests in the same period of time.},

abstract = {Today's Web Applications (WAs) are complex multi-user and multi-tenant software systems, used by users with different roles and often developed to support and manage complex business processes. Due to the changing nature of such processes, WAs need to be easily and quickly modified, to be adapted and aligned to the processes they support. In recent years, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches have been used to support the development and the evolution of WAs. However, the definition of appropriate MDE approaches for the development of flexible process-centric WAs is still limited. In particular, flexible workflow models have never been integrated with the models used in MDE approaches to develop this type of applications. This paper proposes an MDE approach for the development and the evolution of flexible process-centric WAs that integrates four MDE metamodels used to represent the main components of a WA with the metamodel of Declare, a declarative language to model business processes. A case study, carried out to validate the feasibility, the correctness and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Online Social Media (OSM) are among the most popular web services. Traditional OSM are known to be affected by serious issues including misinformation, fake news, censorship, and privacy violations, to the point that a pressing demand for new paradigms is raised by users all over the world. Among such paradigms, the concepts around the Web 3.0 are fueling a new revolution of online sociality, pushing towards the adoption of innovative and groundbreaking technologies. In particular, the decentralization of social services through the blockchain technology is representing the most valid alternative to current OSM, enabling the development of rewarding strategies for value redistribution, and fake news detection. However, the so-called Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSMs) are far from being mature, with different platforms that continually try to redefine their services in order to attract larger audiences, thus causing blockchain forks and massive user migrations, with the latter dominating the dynamics of the current OSM landscape, too. In this paper, we deal with the evolution of BOSMs from the perspective of user migration across platforms as a consequence of a fork event. We propose a general user migration model applicable to BOSMs to represent the evolution patterns of fork-based migrations, the multi-interaction structural complexity of BOSMs, and their growth characteristics. Within this framework, we also cope with the task of predicting how users will behave in the case of a fork, i.e. they will remain on the original blockchain or they will migrate to the new one. We apply our framework to the case study of the Steem-Hive fork event, and show the importance of considering both social and economic information, regardless of the learning algorithm considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on blockchain fork and its related user migration.},

abstract = {Blockchain games introduce unique gameplay and incentive mechanisms by allowing players to be rewarded with in-game assets or tokens through financial activities. However, most blockchain games are not comparable to traditional games in terms of lifespan and player engagement. In this paper, we try to see the big picture in a small way to explore and determine the impact of gameplay and financial factors on player behavior in blockchain games. Taking Aavegotchi as an example, we collect one year of operation data to build player profiles. We perform an in-depth analysis of player behavior from the macroscopic data and apply an unsupervised clustering method to distinguish the attraction of the gameplay and incentives. Our results reveal that the whole game is held up by a small number of players with high-frequent interaction or vast amounts of funds invested. Financial incentives are indispensable for blockchain games for they provide attraction and optional ways for players to engage with the game. However, financial services are tightly linked to the free market. The game will face an irreversible loss of players when the market experiences depression. For blockchain games, well-designed gameplay should be the fundamental basis for the long-lasting retention of players.},

abstract = {The Metaverse, envisioned as the next-generation Internet, will be constructed via twining a practical world in a virtual form, wherein Meterverse service providers (MSPs) are required to collect massive data from Meterverse users (MUs). In this regard, a critical demand exists for MSPs to motivate MUs to contribute computing resources and data while preserving user privacy. Federated learning (FL), as a privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning paradigm, can support distributed intensive computation in the Metaverse. In this work, we first investigate minting the machine learning models into NFT with FL assistance (referred to as FL-NFT), such that MUs as stakeholders can control the ownership and share the economic value of user-generated content (UGC). Specifically, MUs are encouraged to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (i.e., MU-DAO) to aggregate local models and mint FL-NFT. MUs and MSPs optimize the strategies by formulating an imperfect information Stackelberg game to trade off the cost and benefit. We apply the backward induction to derive the equilibrium solution. Then, we construct a privacy-preserving multi-winner sealed-bid auction mechanism (PMS-AM), in which the Hidden Markov Model assists MSPs in choosing rational bidding strategies according to historical bids, and the double auction mechanism determines the winners and price of FL-NFT. Finally, the numerical results based on theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed PMS-AM can increase the quality of FL-NFT and achieve the economic properties of incentive mechanisms such as individual rationality and incentive compatibility.},

Participants opt for smart contract wallets to simplify key management, leveraging social interactions. However, they prefer personal devices over individuals as guardians to avoid social cybersecurity concerns in managing guardian relationships. When engaging in high-stakes or complex transactions, they often choose browser-based wallets, leveraging third-party security extensions. For simpler transactions, they prefer the convenience of mobile wallets. Many participants avoid hardware wallets due to usability issues and security concerns with respect to key recovery service provided by manufacturer and phishing attacks. Social networks play a dual role: participants seek security advice from friends, but also express security concerns in soliciting this help. We offer novel insights into how and why users adopt specific wallets. We also discuss design recommendations for future wallet technologies based on our findings.},

While his work remains controversial, re-examining his ideas might advance efforts to design for learning at scale. First, we examine three design principles that emerge from Illich's writing on learning webs: (1) a holistic perspective that incorporates multidisciplinary thinking (in Illich's case, blending philosophy, politics, sociology, economics, theology, and cybernetics), (2) learning webs as a framework for thinking about learning beyond the limitations of school, and (3) broadening our view of what should be scaled (e.g., scaling opportunities rather than content). Second, we discuss three tensions in Illich's work that relate to scaling learning: (1) decentralization vs. centralization, (2) place-based vs. online learning at scale, and (3) serving the advantaged vs. the disadvantaged. In discussing these ideas and tensions, we discuss contemporary technologies and models, which may be seen as similar to learning webs. Finally, we suggest that Illich's work offers an opportunity to further connect work that sits across two related research communities: Learning @ Scale and connected learning.},

In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.},

They have a real impact on how systems are designed and what values they have embedded in their design. This article examines imaginaries about autonomous systems, decentralized systems, and decentralized autonomous systems. Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

abstract = {User migration, i.e. the movement of large sets of users from one online social platform to another one, is one of the main phenomena occurring in modern online social networks and even involves the most recent alternative paradigms of online social networks, such as blockchain online social networks (BOSNs). In these platforms, user migration mainly occurs through hard forks of the supporting blockchain, i.e. a split of the original blockchain and the creation of an alternative blockchain, to which users may decide to migrate. However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

With help from this platform, the effort in deployment of a pervasive system will be reduced significantly. Apart from enhancing the deployment process, we also provide tools for monitoring and managing the targeted environment. These tools will be supported by services such as path finding, localization service and other smart location-based service to enable user interaction with system.

abstract = {Anonymous credentials empower users with strong privacy controls by enabling them to selectively disclose specific attributes from a credential without unveiling other personal details. However, current anonymous credential systems confront two primary challenges: 1) Their designs are not tailored for resource-limited devices due to their dependence on computationally heavy techniques such as generic zero-knowledge or Groth-Sahai proofs at both presentation and verification phases; and 2) They pose complexities in deploying anonymous credentials as-a-service since users must maintain specific key materials and dedicated software. To tackle these challenges, we present SilentProof, a blockchain-backed anonymous authentication protocol, which offloads the responsibility of credential presentation from individual users to the blockchain. By harnessing the combined strengths of zero-knowledge proxy re-identification and blind signatures, SilentProof empowers the blockchain to create zero-knowledge proofs for users, while ensuring clear user consent and eliminating the need for direct access to user-specific attributes. This design broadens the use cases for anonymous credentials, making it ideal for scalable, secure, and privacy-centric authentication, especially for resource-limited clients. Furthermore, SilentProof lays the groundwork for a new era of privacy-preserving identity management as-a-service. We provide rigorous security proofs to validate our approach and have developed a SilentProof prototype, showcasing the protocol's practical efficiency.},

abstract = {Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been leveraged for defining decentralized economies for the (commercial or private) trade of virtual and physical assets, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formalize proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, unlike existing non-consensus solutions, which are prone to be more compute-time and audit-time intensive, we present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive, through a stochastic game analysis, block proposal strategies under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that when a majority of the consensus protocol participants are licensed by the regulator to propose legal transactions, there exists a fair consensus execution policy to maximize the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network.},

The significant burden that diabetes imposes warrants efforts to improve existing interventions in diabetes care. Present research on diabetes management has shown that artificial intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM) play an important role in various aspects of the diabetes continuum but a distinct lack of studies in diabetes prevention is observed. Our research introduces a comprehensive digital solution, leveraging the capabilities of GPT-3.5 models maintained by OpenAI, focused specifically on the active prevention of diabetes. The system encompasses a user-friendly interface accessible via mobile and web applications, an AI-powered chatbot for instant Q&amp;A and advice, personalized reminder systems, a data analysis module for tailored guidance, resource aggregators for health-related information, and an emotional support module to ensure a holistic approach to prevention. Furthermore, our experiments involved testing the quality of responses generated by a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, utilizing the Assistants API or a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by FAISS for enhanced context awareness and personalized advice. The testing focused on a structured dataset of questions and answers related to diabetes prevention, with results highlighting the superiority of the GPT-3.5 model combined with the Assistants API in providing relevant, detailed, and personalized responses, thus demonstrating its potential as an invaluable tool in the proactive prevention of diabetes.},

abstract = {Threshold signatures protect the signing key by sharing it among a group of signers so that an adversary must corrupt a threshold number of signers to be able to forge signatures. Existing threshold signatures with succinct signatures and constant verification times do not work if signers have different weights. Such weighted settings are seeing increasing importance in decentralized systems, especially in the Proof-of-Stake blockchains. This paper presents a new paradigm for threshold signatures for pairing and discrete logarithm-based cryptosystems. Our scheme has a compact verification key consisting of only 7 group elements, and a signature consisting of 8 group elements. Verifying the signature requires 8 exponentiations and 8 bilinear pairings. Our scheme supports arbitrary weight distributions among signers and arbitrary thresholds. It requires non-interactive preprocessing after a universal powers-of-tau setup. We prove the security of our scheme in the Algebraic Group Model and implement it using Golang. Our evaluation shows that our scheme achieves a comparable signature size and verification time to a standard (unweighted) threshold signature. Compared to existing multisignature schemes, our scheme has a much smaller public verification key.},

Although code coverage has traditionally been a popular test adequacy criterion, we believe it alone is not adequate for assessing the quality of web application test cases. We propose a set of novel DOM-based test adequacy criteria for web applications. These criteria aim at measuring coverage at two granularity levels, (1) the percentage of DOM states and transitions covered in the total state space of the web application under test, and (2) the percentage of elements covered in each particular DOM state. We present a technique and tool, called DomCovery, which automatically extracts and measures the proposed adequacy criteria and generates a visual DOM coverage report. Our evaluation shows that there is no correlation between code coverage and DOM coverage. A controlled experiment illustrates that participants using DomCovery completed coverage related tasks 22\% more accurately and 66\% faster.},

Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

The macro-level exploration provides a big picture on the endeavors made by blockchain professionals over the years to enhance the blockchain performance while the micro-level investigation details the blockchain building blocks for deep technology comprehension. More specifically, this article introduces a general modular blockchain analytic framework that decomposes a blockchain system into interacting modules and then examines the major modules to cover the essential blockchain components of network, consensus, and distributed ledger at the micro-level. The framework as well as the modular analysis jointly build a foundation for designing scalable, flexible, and application-adaptive blockchains that can meet diverse requirements. Additionally, this article explores popular technologies that can be integrated with blockchain to expand functionality and highlights major challenges.

abstract = {Predicting performance of multi-tier enterprise applications for a target platform is of significant importance to IT industries especially when target environment is unavailable for deployment. Performance modeling techniques depend on accurate estimation of resource demands for a specific application. This paper proposes a methodology for deriving Performance Mimicking Benchmarks (PMBs) that can predict resource demand of application server of multi-tier on-line transaction processing applications on a target environment. PMBs do not require the actual application to be deployed on the target itself. These benchmarks invoke similar method calls as the application at different layers in the technology stack that contribute significantly to CPU utilization. Further, they mimic all send and receive interactions with external servers (e.g., database server) and web clients. Ability of PMBs for service demand prediction is validated with a number of sample multi-tier applications including SPECjEnterprise2010 on disparate hardware configurations. These service demands when used in a modified version of Mean Value Analysis algorithm, can predict throughput and response time with accuracy close to 90\%.},

abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, human daily life has become deeply bound to the Internet. To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some technical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the revolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings. Finally, we explore several challenges and issues in this promising area.},

abstract = {Video recommendation has become an indispensable means of helping individuals navigate through the vast expanse of videos and discover content that aligns with their interests. In current video recommendation systems, recommendations are made based on user-video interactions and specific individual content features. Despite the richness of information contained within videos, the challenge lies in effectively representing and extracting distinctive features that can be presented to users. Presently, video recommendation models predominantly rely on isolated video features for suggestions, without effectively harnessing the available information by combining these features cohesively. In this article, we introduce a video model called Video Sage, which integrate numerous video characteristics with a user’s interaction history. The model is rooted in the concept of Graph Convolution Neural Network (GCN), which can discern user-video interactions and maintain scalability for future data. Additionally, we propose a solution for embedding and merging complex video features, which serve as input to the Video Sage model, enhancing recommendation efficiency. Our method has been rigorously tested on a dataset comprising users’ video viewing histories on social networks and has yielded exceptionally competitive results.},

abstract = {Cheapfakes is a new term for fake media that is made without AI, but with simple tools or captions that deceive or mislead. Cheapfakes include photos, videos, audio recordings, or any media that has been changed to distort its original meaning or context. The "ACM ICMR 2024 Grand Challenge on Detecting Cheapfakes" focuses on the challenge of finding out-of-context (OOC) media, which can assist fact-checkers in their work. By finding OOC media, we can narrow down the search space and raise the chances of discovering cheapfakes. To cope with this challenge, in this research paper, our team propose a novel approach that combines Context Generation and Text Classification as the key components in detecting cheapfakes. Our method was evaluated using 80\% of the public test set from the COSMOS dataset, which includes two context labels: out-of-context and not-out-of-context. The results demonstrate an accuracy of 85.9\%, validating the effectiveness and reliability of our method in identifying cheapfakes.},

This work considers blockchains as a socio-technical system of rules, in order to draw a comparison with legal systems. Following the comparison, one finds that most blockchains lack what, in legal theory, are considered secondary rules. That is, the meta-rule of the system.This works examines the relevant concepts and provides their definitions, then proceeds to outline concrete example of the failure of governance among popular blockchains before drawing the parallelism with legal systems and argue that secondary rules might solve some of the issues of the governance of blockchains.Secondary rules are the necessary infrastructure for building sound governance structures and a necessary condition for blockchains to succeed as a new mode of governance.

abstract = {Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) blockchains, such as EOSIO, Steem and TRON, are governed by a committee of block producers elected via a coin-based voting system. We recently witnessed the first de facto blockchain takeover that happened between Steem and TRON. Within one hour of this incident, TRON founder took over the entire Steem committee, forcing the original Steem community to leave the blockchain that they maintained for years. This is a historical event in the evolution of blockchains and Web 3.0. Despite its significant disruptive impact, little is known about how vulnerable DPoS blockchains are in general to takeovers and the ways in which we can improve their resistance to takeovers.In this paper, we demonstrate that the resistance of a DPoS blockchain to takeovers is governed by both the theoretical design and the actual use of its underlying coin-based voting governance system. When voters actively cooperate to resist potential takeovers, our theoretical analysis reveals that the current active resistance of DPoS blockchains is far below the theoretical upper bound. However in practice, voter preferences could be significantly different. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of the passive takeover resistance of EOSIO, Steem and TRON. Our study identifies the diversity in voter preferences and characterizes the impact of this diversity on takeover resistance. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, our study provides novel insights into the security of coin-based voting governance and suggests potential ways to improve the takeover resistance of any blockchain that implements this governance model.},

abstract = {Big Data applications can revolutionize any platform by facilitating the analysis of large amounts of information. However, the biggest challenge associated with Big Data is overcoming the intellectual property barriers associated with the use of this data, especially in cross-database applications. Although intellectual property provisions have been formulated to limit inappropriate use and manage access to Big Data, it is difficult to make this trade-off and overcome the challenges of Big Data. This paper explores the limits of intellectual property rights in Big Data applications. The advent of Big Data requires an alternative conceptual framework along with security policies and regulations. The profound issues of copyright on cross-database platforms are highlighted in this paper, as well as the paradigm shift from ownership to control of access to and use of Big Data, especially on cross-database platforms. We also present a real-world case study of the underlying technologies of cross-data analytics (xdata.nict.jp). The xData platform aims to coordinate competing social, personal, and industrial interests in data to ensure fair access while minimizing legal and ethical threats. Finally, we discuss the idea of using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to protect intellectual property rights on cross-data platforms and highlight some important aspects of copyright issues, highlighting key issues and current open challenges.},

abstract = {Brain imaging genetics studies the genetic basis of brain structures and functionalities via integrating genotypic data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imaging quantitative traits (QTs). In this area, both multi-task learning (MTL) and sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) methods are widely used since they are superior to those independent and pairwise univariate analysis. MTL methods generally incorporate a few of QTs and could not select features from multiple QTs; while SCCA methods typically employ one modality of QTs to study its association with SNPs. Both MTL and SCCA are computational expensive as the number of SNPs increases. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task SCCA (MTSCCA) method to identify bi-multivariate associations between SNPs and multi-modal imaging QTs. MTSCCA could make use of the complementary information carried by different imaging modalities. MTSCCA enforces sparsity at the group level via the G2;1-norm, and jointly selects features across multiple tasks for SNPs and QTs via the `2;1-norm. A fast optimization algorithm is proposed using the grouping information of SNPs. Compared with conventional SCCA methods, MTSCCA obtains better correlation coefficients and canonical weights patterns. In addition, MTSCCA runs very fast and easy-to-implement, indicating its potential power in genome-wide brain-wide imaging genetics.},

In this paper, we use ParaSwap as an example to propose a role taxonomy methodology through a data-driven study to understand the characteristic of community members and the effectiveness of airdrop. We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters.

abstract = {Distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enable new forms of business collaboration while the combination with smart contracts allows for an automation of business and collaboration processes. The immutability of DLT secures the execution of business processes. Hence, any process automation or resource management activities are tamper-proof. Yet, a widespread use can only takeoff, if business process experts can directly use this new form of technology, since business process experts are not necessarily programming experts. Thus, we argue for a high-level business process modeling to allow an application-oriented formulation of business collaboration. Hence it is important to research the instantiation and execution of business processes on DLTs, which are formulated in conventional notations.Existing approaches for process implementation on DLTs build-upon state machines that encode the process flow in smart contracts. Thereby every process instantiation requires the creation of a new smart contract with its state machine. In contrast we propose a variant of process implementation that builds-upon an extending kernel. The execution logic is encoded as a core function in the validation routine of DLT nodes. Going down this avenue, the process flow is specified inside transactions and the validation routine will ensure that the process is correctly executed. We validate the implementation of our approach and compare it to alternatives that implement processes by state machines across smart contracts.},

abstract = {Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) leverage natural language dialogues to provide tailored recommendations. Traditional methods in this field primarily focus on extracting user preferences from isolated dialogues. It often yields responses with a limited perspective, confined to the scope of individual conversations. Recognizing the potential in collective dialogue examples, our research proposes an expanded approach for CRS models, utilizing selective analogues from dialogue histories and responses to enrich both generation and recommendation processes. This introduces significant research challenges, including: (1) How to secure high-quality collections of recommendation dialogue exemplars? (2) How to effectively leverage these exemplars to enhance CRS models?To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel Demonstration-enhanced Conversational Recommender System (DCRS), which aims to strengthen its understanding on the given dialogue contexts by retrieving and learning from demonstrations. In particular, we first propose a knowledge-aware contrastive learning method that adeptly taps into the mentioned entities and the dialogue's contextual essence for pretraining the demonstration retriever. Subsequently, we further develop two adaptive demonstration-augmented prompt learning approaches, involving contextualized prompt learning and knowledge-enriched prompt learning, to bridge the gap between the retrieved demonstrations and the two end tasks of CRS, i.e., response generation and item recommendation, respectively. Rigorous evaluations on two established benchmark datasets underscore DCRS's superior performance over existing CRS methods in both item recommendation and response generation.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a very powerful technology and can be a potential disrupter and essential enabler. As AI expands into almost every aspect of our lives, people raise serious concerns about AI misbehaving and misuse. To address this concern, international organizations have put forward ethics guidelines for constructing trustworthy AI (TAI), including privacy, transparency, fairness, robustness, accountability, and so on. However, because of the black-box characteristics and complex models of AI systems, it is challenging to translate these guiding principles and aspirations into AI systems. Blockchain, an important decentralized technology, can provide the capabilities of transparency, traceability, immutability, and secure sharing and hence can be used to make AI trustworthy. In this paper, we survey studies on blockchain-based TAI (BTAI) from a software development lifecycle view. We classify the lifecycle of BTAI into four stages: Planning, data collection, model development, and system deployment/use. Particularly, we investigate and summarize the trustworthy issues that blockchain can achieve in the latter three stages, including (1) data transparency, privacy, and accountability; (2) model transparency, privacy, robustness, and fairness; and (3) robustness, privacy, transparency, and fairness of system deployment/use. Finally, we present essential open research issues and future work on developing BTAI systems.},
