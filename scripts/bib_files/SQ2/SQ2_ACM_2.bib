abstract = {Workload surges are a serious hindrance to performance of even high-throughput key-value data stores, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and more recently Aerospike. In this paper, we present a decentralized admission controller for high-throughput key-value data stores. The proposed controller dynamically regulates the release time of incoming requests explicitly taking into account different Quality of Service (QoS) classes. In particular, an instance of such controller is assigned to each client for its autonomous admission control specific to the client's QoS requirements. These controllers operate in a decentralized manner with only local performance metrics, response time and queue waiting time. Despite the use of such "minimal" run-time state information, our decentralized admission controller is capable of coping with workload surges respecting QoS requirements. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed admission controller with the default scheduling policy of Aerospike, in a testbed cluster under various workload intensity rates. Experimental results confirm that the proposed controller improves QoS satisfaction in terms of end-to-end response time by nearly 12 times, on average, compared with that of Aerospike's, in high-rate workload. Results also show decreases of the average and standard deviation of latency up to 31\% and 50\%, respectively, during workload surges (peak load) in high-rate workload.},

abstract = {Advancements in CMOS technology enable the integration of a huge number of resources on the same system-on-chip. Managing the consequent growing complexity, including fault tolerance issues in deep submicron technologies, is a hard challenge for hardware designers. Self-organization may represent a viable path toward the development of massively parallel architectures in current and future technologies. This approach is progressively more studied in multiprocessor architectures where, however, a further mind-set shift in terms of programming paradigm is required.In this article, self-organization and self-adaptiveness are exploited for the design of a coprocessing unit for array computations, supporting floating-point arithmetic. From the experience of previous explorations, an architecture embodying some principle of swarm intelligence to pursue adaptability, scalability, and fault tolerance is proposed. The architecture realizes a loosely structured collection of hardware agents implementing fixed behavioral rules aimed at the best exploitation of the available resources in whatever kind of context without any hardware reconfiguration. Comparisons with off-the-shelf very long instruction word (VLIW) digital signal processors (DSPs) on specific tasks reveal similar performance thus not paying the improved robustness with performance. The multitasking capabilities, together with the intrinsic scalability, make this approach valuable for future extensions as well, especially in the field of neuronal networks simulators.},

abstract = {Having a transparent and convenient insurance system is desired by users, but the insurance industry currently plays differently. For example, when users ask for a fast and simple self-service, the industry may need a long and cumbersome process, and sometimes users are not sure whether they have a fair deal according to their contract. With the aim of enhancing the current bicycle insurance system in Denmark, we investigate the local market and develop BlockCycle, which is a blockchain-based bicycle insurance system. The basic idea is that insurance companies transform their insurance products into a smart contract, including the criteria of applying the product and the eligibility of compensating into program logic. When a smart contract is deployed, the immutability can ensure the deal integrity and protect both users and insurance companies from the threat of unauthorized manipulation. In addition, blockchain can provide a secure and simple way to decentralize data and services, which enables high availability and reliability. Our experimental results indicate the viability of our system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for decentralized monitoring of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, under the situation where processes are synchronous and the formula is represented as a tableau. The tableau technique allows one to construct a semantic tree for the input LTL formula, which can be used to optimize the decentralized monitoring of LTL in various ways. Given a system P and an LTL formula φ, we construct a tableau Tφ. The tableau Tφ is used for two purposes: (a) to synthesize an efficient round-robin communication policy for processes, and (b) to find the minimal ways to decompose the formula and communicate observations of processes in an efficient way. In our framework, processes can propagate truth values of both atomic and compound formulas (non-atomic formulas) depending on the syntactic structure of the input LTL formula and the observation power of processes. We demonstrate that this approach of decentralized monitoring based on tableau construction is more straightforward, more flexible, and more likely to yield efficient solutions than alternative approaches.},

Two years ago the total value locked in DeFi systems was approximately 700m USD, now, as of April 2022, it stands at around 150bn USD. The frenetic evolution of the ecosystem has created challenges in understanding the basic principles of these systems and their security risks. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) we delineate the DeFi ecosystem along the following axes: its primitives, its operational protocol types and its security. We provide a distinction between technical security, which has a healthy literature, and economic security, which is largely unexplored, connecting the latter with new models and thereby synthesizing insights from computer science, economics and finance. Finally, we outline the open research challenges in the ecosystem across these security types.},

Comparing to a centralised system, we evaluate our approach over 205 machines executing 2500 tasks. The results show that our decentralised system runs better than the same system configured as a master/slave because it gives less overhead.},

abstract = {Sampling rate adaptation is a critical issue in many resource-constrained networked systems, including Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Existing algorithms are primarily employed to detect events such as objects or physical changes at a high, low, or fixed frequency sampling usually adapted by a central unit or a sink, therefore requiring additional resource usage. Additionally, this algorithm potentially makes a network unable to capture a dynamic change or event of interest, which therefore affects monitoring quality. This article studies the problem of a fully autonomous adaptive sampling regarding the presence of a change or event. We propose a novel scheme, termed “event-sensitive adaptive sampling and low-cost monitoring (e-Sampling)” by addressing the problem in two stages, which leads to reduced resource usage (e.g., energy, radio bandwidth). First, e-Sampling provides the embedded algorithm to adaptive sampling that automatically switches between high- and low-frequency intervals to reduce the resource usage, while minimizing false negative detections. Second, by analyzing the frequency content, e-Sampling presents an event identification algorithm suitable for decentralized computing in resource-constrained networks. In the absence of an event, the “uninteresting” data is not transmitted to the sink. Thus, the energy cost is further reduced. e-Sampling can be useful in a broad range of applications. We apply e-Sampling to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Fire Event Monitoring (FEM), which are typical applications of high-frequency events. Evaluation via both simulations and experiments validates the advantages of e-Sampling in low-cost event monitoring, and in effectively expanding the capacity of WSNs for high data rate applications.},

abstract = {Complex pervasive applications need to be distributed for two main reasons: due to the typical resource restrictions of mobile devices, and to use local services to interact with the immediate environment. To set up such an application, the distributed components require spontaneous composition. Since dynamics in the environment and device failures may imply the unavailability of components and devices at any time, finding, maintaining, and adapting such a composition is a nontrivial task. Moreover, the speed of such a configuration process directly influences the user since in the event of a configuration, the user has to wait. In this article, we introduce configuration algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We discuss a comprehensive approach to pervasive application configuration that adapts to the characteristics of the environment: It chooses the most efficient configuration method for the given environment to minimize the configuration latency. Moreover, we propose a new scheme for caching and reusing partial application configurations. This scheme reduces the configuration latency even further such that a configuration can be executed without notable disturbance of the user.},

abstract = {The increasing number of smart systems provides more and more independently developed services. Though the services are intended to work autonomously, their participation within a collaboration will result in a synergy more than only the sum of the individual parts. The challenge to demarcate the individual services and their collaboration and to avoid mutual dependencies has been recently approached by utilizing the Concept of Roles, providing roles, which interact with other roles within a collaboration, and are performed by players. Roles can intermesh with their player and thereby change their behavior solely for the collaboration they are participating in. The collaborative nature of roles, i.e., inherently describing complex interactions, is highly beneficial to dynamic, autonomous composition of collaborative systems. This paper contributes a protocol for coordinated composition of role-based continuous service collaborations in decentralized smart computing environments. An experimental evaluation underlines the feasibility of a decentralized approach since discovery and composition of services can be performed in reasonably short time even in setups up to 150 services involved in a single collaboration.},

However, the training data often contains sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. Federated Learning has been proposed as a solution to mitigate privacy risks. Despite its advantages, Federated Learning still faces challenges such as the aggregator being a single point of failure, the existence of malicious participants, and the lack of incentives. Combining Federated Learning with blockchain technology could potentially address these challenges. In this study, we propose a new method for asynchronous Federated Learning using blockchain smart contracts. Our proposed method operates autonomously and in a decentralized manner without the need to trust any central organization, making it trustless. We propose an algorithm that motivates workers to submit high-quality models as quickly as possible. Workers’ behaviors are driven by incentive mechanisms. We deployed a smart contract on a local Ethereum blockchain and executed multiple workers. Our evaluation results demonstrate that learning converges and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional Federated Learning, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

We introduce DIET core features and describe how they support basic mobile agent capabilities such as migration and real-time interaction. We then illustrate how an ecosystem-inspired design approach differs from conventional design approaches. Finally, we experiment with a simple information retrieval scenario, demonstrating the emergence of agent communities through the evolution of environmental preferences. In this way we hope to clarify how applications built on this foundation could be used to tackle problems in adaptable and open real-world scenarios.},

This is no different when it comes to road traffic congestion avoidance mechanisms that utilize VANETs. There are several examples of VANET-based approaches to road traffic congestion avoidance that are tested using simulations in the literature. Notwithstanding, the replicability and extensibility of many approaches are limited due to the fact that their implementations are not publicly available. In this work, based on prior work, a decentralized mechanism is designed and implemented to perform road traffic congestion avoidance in VANETs. Evaluation results show that due to vehicles having longer trip times, vehicular density in the road network can be up to 2.5 times higher in scenarios where the road traffic congestion avoidance mechanism is not in use. Unlike prior work, we make the implementation publicly-available to enhance its replicability and extensibility.},

abstract = {In actor-critic framework for fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), one of the key components is the MARL policy evaluation (PE) problem, where a set of N agents work cooperatively to evaluate the value function of the global states for a given policy through communicating with their neighbors. In MARL-PE, a critical challenge is how to lower the sample and communication complexities, which are defined as the number of training samples and communication rounds needed to converge to some ε-stationary point. To lower communication complexity in MARL-PE, a ''natural'' idea is to perform multiple local TD-update steps between each consecutive rounds of communication to reduce the communication frequency. However, the validity of the local TD-update approach remains unclear due to the potential ''agent-drift'' phenomenon resulting from heterogeneous rewards across agents in general. This leads to an interesting open question: Can the local TD-update approach entail low sample and communication complexities? In this paper, we make the first attempt to answer this fundamental question. We focus on the setting of MARL-PE with average reward, which is motivated by many multi-agent network optimization problems. Our theoretical and experimental results confirm that allowing multiple local TD-update steps is indeed an effective approach in lowering the sample and communication complexities of MARL-PE compared to consensus-based MARL-PE algorithms. Specifically, the local TD-update steps between two consecutive communication rounds can be as large as O (1/ε1/2 log(1/ε)) in order to converge to an ε-stationary point of MARL-PE. Moreover, we show theoretically that in order to reach the optimal sample complexity, the communication complexity of local TD-update approach is O (1/ε1/2 log(1/ε)).},

In particular, adaptive and self-organizing decentralized solutions have been advanced for optimizing the placement of applications at the Edge. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic mathematical model that allows to describe one of such solutions. The goal of the model is twofold: i) to make it possible to demonstrate the convergence of the proposed solution; ii) to study the impact of the self-organizing solution without the need of an actual implementation or simulation of the system, allowing to evaluate the suitability of the solution in specific contexts. The paper presents the mathematical formulation of the proposed solution as well as the validation of the proposed model against a simulation of the system.},

On the other hand, there is a relatively large cost for transferring data via P2P channels due to bandwidth and unreliability issues. Here, we propose a novel compression mechanism for P2P machine learning that is based on the application of stateful codecs over P2P links. In addition, we also rely on transfer learning for extra compression. This means that we train a relatively small model on top of a high quality pre-trained feature set that is fixed. We demonstrate these contributions through an experimental analysis over a real smartphone trace.},

abstract = {Modern software systems are challenging challenge software engineers since they must adapt effectively and efficiently with respect to the environment in which they are deployed. To this end, the paper outlines an architecture, supported by special-purpose languages and aspect oriented techniques, for the design of component-based of distributed self-adaptive systems. Software artifacts are dynamically grouped, and constantly supervised by a network of ad-hoc components. The supervision mechanism exploits special-purpose languages that define data collection, correlation, aggregation, and analysis, to reason on properties defined at different levels of pervasiveness (from component-wide to system-wide). Its goal is to identify situations that trigger adaptations. Our approach is characterized by a decentralized architecture in which there is no single point of failure or bottleneck, and a clear separation of concerns between business logic and adaptation mechanisms. These concepts are demonstrated by a fantasy example that offers a general abstraction for distributed load balancing problems.},

abstract = {Federated learning enables collaborative AI training across organizations without compromising data privacy. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) improves this by offering enhanced reliability and security through peer-to-peer (P2P) model sharing. However, DFL faces challenges in terms of slow convergence rate due to complex P2P graphs. To address this issue, we propose an efficient algorithm to accelerate DFL by introducing a limited number of k of edges into the P2P graphs. Specifically, we establish a connection between the convergence rate and the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix of the P2P graph. We prove that finding the optimal set of edges to maximize this eigenvalue is an NP-complete problem. Our quantitative analysis shows the positive effect of strategic edge additions on improving this eigenvalue. Based on the analysis, we then propose an efficient algorithm to compute the best set of candidate edges to maximize the second smallest eigenvalue, and consequently the convergence rate is maximized. Our algorithm has a low time complexity of O(krn^2). Experimental results on diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in accelerating DFL convergence.},

The design of complex distributed self-adaptive systems having decentralized adaptation control by multiple interacting MAPE components is among the major challenges. In particular, formal methods for designing and assuring the functional correctness of the decentralized adaptation logic are highly demanded.This article presents a framework for formal modeling and analyzing self-adaptive systems. We contribute with a formalism, called self-adaptive Abstract State Machines, that exploits the concept of multiagent Abstract State Machines to specify distributed and decentralized adaptation control in terms of MAPE-K control loops, also possible instances of MAPE patterns. We support validation and verification techniques for discovering unexpected interfering MAPE-K loops, and for assuring correctness of MAPE components interaction when performing adaptation.},

Therefore, we specifically designed a novel Starling Swarm Algorithm (SSA) from the latest research findings of coordination mechanism of starling flock, like local perception, self-adaptation, centerless self-organization and self-adaptation. We designed the SSA combining with local perception, safe avoidance, example selection and decision evolution. In the paper, we also presented 9 basic rules that agent group should follow which reflect the essence of group coordination well. To evaluate coordination effect, we defined convergence coefficient to quantify coordination in the paper. Based on it, we carried out our experiments from parameter analysis, efficiency and effectiveness under different situations and presented our results of changes of convergence coefficient and comparison of SSA with classical PSO. In cases of different agent numbers, we obtained the results of number of iterations for implementing task, respectively, which showed that our algorithm was more efficient than PSO. For effectiveness analysis, simulations of effects of group coordination under various conditions of no obstacle, multiple obstacles and intruder were also presented in the paper.},

However, this issue can only be resolved through the complete decentralization of the platform. To achieve this, blockchain technology is crucial as it enables the operation of decentralized applications with smart contracts serving as the foundation for system-user interaction. In this paper, we propose the minimum viable implementation of a similar social network called Brain Logger, which stores all necessary data in the NEAR blockchain network. Introducing a small fee for modifying data on the network ensures a solution to the aforementioned problems. The implementation includes a smart contract for blockchain networks and a web application frontend. The smart contract was developed using the NEAR software development kit in Rust, while the frontend was created in JavaScript using the React framework and Redux for local data storage.

abstract = {Employee data can be used to facilitate work, but their misusage may pose risks for individuals. Inverse transparency therefore aims to track all usages of personal data, allowing individuals to monitor them to ensure accountability for potential misusage. This necessitates a trusted log to establish an agreed-upon and non-repudiable timeline of events. The unique properties of blockchain facilitate this by providing immutability and availability. For power asymmetric environments such as the workplace, permissionless blockchain is especially beneficial as no trusted third party is required. Yet, two issues remain: (1) In a decentralized environment, no arbiter can facilitate and attest to data exchanges. Simple peer-to-peer sharing of data, conversely, lacks the required non-repudiation. (2) With data governed by privacy legislation such as the GDPR, the core advantage of immutability becomes a liability. After a rightful request, an individual’s personal data need to be rectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain.To solve these issues, we present Kovacs, a decentralized data exchange and usage logging system for inverse transparency built on blockchain. Its new-usage protocol ensures non-repudiation, and therefore accountability, for inverse transparency. Its one-time pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees unlinkability and enables proof of ownership, which allows data subjects to exercise their legal rights regarding their personal data. With our implementation, we show the viability of our solution. The decentralized communication impacts performance and scalability, but exchange duration and storage size are still reasonable. More importantly, the provided information security meets high requirements. We conclude that Kovacs realizes decentralized inverse transparency through secure and GDPR-compliant use of permissionless blockchain.},

In particular, whenever the communication graph changes, the Metropolis-Hastings method [69] is applied to update the weighted adjacency matrix based on the current communication topology. In addition, the Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) scheme [61] is integrated to facilitate privacy in reaching consensus of the global model.

abstract = {Streaming live video over the Internet presents great challenges due to its sheer bandwidth requirements. Client/Server model suffers from scalability issues and high deployment cost to provide this service. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach provides an excellent alternative due to its potential scalability and ease of deployment. Nonetheless, a major limitation of P2P approach lies in its high dependency on users. Since peers relay content, which themselves are controlled by users, the behavior of the latter has a major impact on the streaming quality perceived by users. Indeed, unlike dedicated servers, peers join the system intermittently, which poses great challenges in providing QoS for operated live streaming services. In this paper, we propose an autonomous topology management framework for P2P live streaming architectures that minimizes the impact of peers' frequent departures. It consists in a stabilization strategy for push-based systems that moves unstable peers towards the outskirts of the topology. To validate our approach, we performed experiments on PlanetLab and show here the significant improvement of our contribution as compared to an existing system in terms of the global service quality.},

Thus, there arises a need for a comprehensive scoring system to analyze the value of NFTs. Using a single score is often inadequate, as NFT value is influenced by numerous factors and is assessed based on personal objectives. Addressing the issue, this study explores critical factors influencing NFT value and develops three scores to rank NFTs including rarity, return on investment (ROI), and reputation score. The scores serve to evaluate both NFTs and NFT collections. (i) The rarity score evaluates the level of scarcity, and it applies to NFTs within a collection. (ii) The reputation score evaluates the interest of communities in NFT projects, considering the number of followers and the interaction rate; the score is for NFT collections. (iii) The ROI score assesses the profit generated by NFTs; it applies to both NFTs and NFT collections. Our empirical results show that a well-distributed rarity score of NFTs enhances their demand and profit; high-rarity NFTs are typically associated with a low number of sale transactions. NFT collections with high ROI and high reputation generally draw more attention and yield a positive return. In addition to the three scores, this paper presents a system to collect and process a huge amount of blockchain and social network data for NFT evaluation.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

Inspired by the requirements of these applications, where variables are located at distinct network devices that may not be able to communicate but may interfere, we define natural criteria that a CSP solver must possess in order to be practical. We term these algorithms decentralized CSP solvers. The best known CSP solvers were designed for centralized problems and do not meet these criteria. We introduce a stochastic decentralized CSP solver, proving that it will find a solution in almost surely finite time, should one exist, and also showing it has many practically desirable properties. We benchmark the algorithm's performance on a well-studied class of CSPs, random k-SAT, illustrating that the time the algorithm takes to find a satisfying assignment is competitive with stochastic centralized solvers on problems with order a thousand variables despite its decentralized nature. We demonstrate the solver's practical utility for the problems that motivated its introduction by using it to find a noninterfering channel allocation for a network formed from data from downtown Manhattan.},

The paper identifies a set of important usability, privacy and security issues that needs to be addressed, and proposes an end to end authentication mechanism based on WebID, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and the blockchain. The WebID includes a personal profile with its certificate, and the social relationship information described as the RDF-based FOAF ontology. The JWT is a standardized container format to encode personal related information in a secure way using "claims". The distributed, irreversible, undeletable, and immutable nature of the blockchain has appropriate attributes for distributed credential storage and decentralized identity management.},

abstract = {Unstable channel links in Vehicular Ad hoc Net- works (VANETs) make the design of reliable broadcast schemes challenging. Existing solutions fail to balance the requirements in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), latency and communication overhead, rendering the vehicular broadcast either severe packet losses, long time delay or excessive duplication. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Cooperative Broadcast (DCB) scheme to provide reliable broadcast in VANETs with short latency and lightweight overhead, where all vehicles jointly piggyback some received data to help other neighbors recover the lost packet, and the broadcast links are also flexibly scheduled to enhance the broadcast efficiency. DCB requires no global information but has comparable performance with those solutions holding hypothetical global network information. We prove that DCB is an optimal solution to enhance the PDR when the broadcast is interference-free, and such potential interference can also be solved in DCB with little cost of a bounded time delay. Simulation results show that DCB can achieve an average PDR of 99.6\% in less than 100 ms within a 50-vehicle network, which is far more efficient than existing solutions, even very close to the hypothetical centralized broadcast scheme.},

Broadcast redundancy is minimized by evaluation of application layer information and aggregation. Due to the spatio-temporal characteristics of parking place information, the spatial distribution of information is limited by utilizing techniques, which take the local relevance and age of information into account.Based on a realistic model of a german city with up to 10000 vehicles, our results show that a decentralized parking place information system works efficiently even with 5\% of vehicles equipped with Wireless-LAN and without the help of any message relaying infrastructure. This fact makes such a non-safety driver assistance application very interesting, especially in the rollout phase of vehicular ad hoc networks.},

As an answer to all these factors, several disruptive technologies that have come into focus during the last few years, as well as some alternative business models, must be considered as a part of Industry 4.0 and here, particularly, as a part of Car Industry 4.0. In this context, DLT is also seen as one of disruptive technologies. Therefore, this paper analyzes DLT as a part of a Car Industry 4.0 and their main properties.

abstract = {Platoon systems, as a type of adaptive cruise control systems, will play a significant role to improve travel experience and roadway safety. The stability of a platoon system is crucial so that each vehicle maintains a safety distance from its proceeding vehicle and can take necessary actions to avoid collisions. However, current centralized platoon maintenance method cannot meet this requirement. We suggest to use a decentralized platoon maintenance method, in which each vehicle communicates with its neighbor vehicles and self-determines its own velocity. However, a vehicle needs to know its distance from its preceding vehicle to determine its velocity, which is unavailable in vehicle communication disconnection caused by vehicle dynamics (i.e., node joins and departures). Thus, a formidable challenge is: how to recover the platoon quickly in vehicle dynamics even when the distance information is unavailable? To handle this challenge, we first profile a succeeding vehicle's velocity to minimize the time to recover the connectivity hole with its preceding vehicle and find that the profiles are almost the same at the beginning regardless of its current velocity and distance to its preceding vehicle. Accordingly, we devise a strategy, in which a succeeding vehicle uses its stored common velocity profile when it is disconnected from its preceding vehicle and then adjusts its velocity once the connection is built. Experimental results from simulation show the efficiency and effectiveness of our decentralized platoon maintenance method.},

abstract = {Mobile devices generate and store voluminous data valuable for training machine learning (ML) models. Decentralized ML model training approaches eliminate the need for sharing such privacy-sensitive data with centralized entities by expecting each data owner that participates in an ML model training process to compute updates locally and share them with other entities. However, the size of state-of-the-art ML models and the computational needs for producing local updates in mobile devices prohibit the participation of mobile devices in decentralized training of such models. Split learning techniques can be combined with decentralized model training protocols to realize the involvement of mobile devices in model training while preserving the privacy of their data. Mobile devices can produce local updates by splitting the model they are training into multiple parts and delegating the processing of the computationally demanding parts to compute nodes. This work examines the impact of the number of available compute nodes and their interaction. We split ResNet101 ML model into 3,4, and 5 parts, keep the first and the last part in the data owner and assign the processing of the middle parts to compute nodes. Additionally, we analyze the training time when the compute nodes assist multiple data owners in parallel or are responsible for different model parts by forming a pipeline.},

The first approach relies on systems with a centralized specification, i.e., when the specification is written for the behavior of the entire system. To do so, our approach introduces a data structure that (i) keeps track of the execution of an automaton (ii) has predictable parameters and size, and (iii) guarantees strong eventual consistency. The second approach defines decentralized specifications wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system. We study two properties of decentralized specifications pertaining to monitorability and compatibility between specification and architecture. We also present a general algorithm for monitoring decentralized specifications. We map three existing algorithms to our approaches and provide a framework for analyzing their behavior. Furthermore, we present THEMIS, a framework for designing such decentralized algorithms and simulating their behavior. We demonstrate the usage of THEMIS to compare multiple algorithms and validate the trends predicted by the analysis in two scenarios: a synthetic benchmark and the Chiron user interface.},

Our starting point is to consider an agent attempting to estimate the utility of a contract, and we show that this leads to a model of computational trust whereby an agent must determine a vector of estimates that represent the probability that any dimension of the contract will be successfully fulfilled, and a covariance matrix that describes the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities. We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions. We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised reputation system. Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within such systems. This solution uses the notion of private and shared information, and provides estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding bias and overconfidence.},

In this light, we address ourselves to decentralized collaborative filtering systems in which individual users interact with each other instead of institutional recommendation providers to obtain recommendations. Decentralized collaborative filtering systems, in which data is distributed over all users, bear a privacy benefit over traditional centralized systems in which data is kept at a single authoritative node. We propose the first formal definition of data minimization for use in distributed systems in order to combine the privacy benefits of data minimization and data distribution. On the basis of this definition, we propose a distributed data minimization scheme based on Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) that solves the data minimization problem for decentralized collaborative filtering systems. Here, data minimization represents a collection minimization problem in which users aim to collect necessary minimum amounts of rating data from other users in the system. We find by means of simulation that the overall amount of data collected by all users can be reduced significantly (&gt; 14.65\%) without jeopardizing recommendation performance, when users coordinate data collection. We thus prove that users collect unnecessarily much data, when they do not coordinate data collection.},

While such self-organizing, peer-to-peer communities offer exciting collaboration opportunities, deciding whether to trust another peer can be challenging. In this work we propose a decentralized trust management middleware for ad-hoc, peer-to-peer networks, based on reputation. Our middleware's protocols take advantage of the unstructured nature of the network to render malicious behavior, such as lying and colluding, risky. The reputation information of each peer is stored in its neighbors and piggy-backed on its replies. By simulating the behavior of networks both with and without a rating scheme we were able to show that just a few dishonest peers can flood the network with false results, whereas this phenomenon is virtually eliminated when using our middleware.},
