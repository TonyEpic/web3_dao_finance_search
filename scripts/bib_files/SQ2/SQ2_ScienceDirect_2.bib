abstract = {This paper investigates a decentralized supply chain that is composed of one manufacturer and multiple distributors. The manufacturer produces goods and wholesales them to multiple distributors and then the distributors sell products to various markets. The entire production period of the manufacturer is divided into several intervals. The decision-making problem of the entire decentralized supply chain is presented as a two-echelon coordination game network, in which each decision-maker can influence decision-making of other levels. A Stackelberg game framework is proposed to coordinate the decision-making process. And then two nonlinear bi-level programming (BLP) models are developed to find the optimal equilibrium decision scheme by switching the leader and follower roles between the manufacturer and the distributors. The models consider the manufacturer’s budget constraints in each interval and the market demands are affected by distributors’ selling price and advertising strategies. According to the hierarchy and complexity of bi-level programming problem (BLPP), a nested bi-level method based on hybrid state transition algorithm is proposed to address the BLP models, and mapping approximation strategy is utilized to improve computational efficiency. Finally, the numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.}

In general, the “state of art” transport systems have a low flexibility of the path planning and are not suitable for dynamic transport requirements, wherefore they are designed for a specific application. Therefore, the object of the research is a cyber-physical material flow system with flexible, autonomous and collaborative vehicles combined with centralized sensors to digitalize the workspace. Furthermore, the number of vehicles in the system can be adjusted to the volume of the transport requirement, wherefore the system is suitable for different tasks in the intralogistics. The sustainability of this concept is given by two aspects. On the one hand by the individual path planning of each task also of small parts. On the other hand by the re-use of the system at changing transport volumes or requirements.}

The development and implementation of sustainable waste management strategies are required in order to establish a circular economy and to harness new sources of renewable energy. A possible solution is the concept of biointelligence, which describes a highly digitalized as well as bio-hybrid mode of interconnected production. Following nature's example, synergies between technical processes in terms of energy and materials are to be identified and utilized. Furthermore, availabilities of sustainable waste sources and consumer needs must be aligned in order to achieve a technology-based demand economy. After recent literature outlined a basic model of a biointelligent value creation system consisting of numerous on-site units, this paper introduces the concept of biointelligent Waste-to-X systems as a technological substantiation. A description of the system model as well as example technologies are presented in order to serve as a basis for their implementation.}

In doing so, the power grid is divided into cells or blocks (i.e., microgrids). Each microgrid should maintain its power demands using its renewable energy resources, local generators, and power storage. This distributed monitoring system will locally solve all load balancing and voltage issues at an intra-microgrid level.}

abstract = {Ethereum’s public distributed ledger can issue tokenised voting rights that are tradable on crypto-asset exchanges by potentially anyone. Ethereum thus enables global, unincorporated associations to conduct governance experiments. Such experiments are crucial to Decentralised Finance (DeFi). DeFi is a nascent field of unlicensed, unregulated, and non-custodial financial services that utilise public distributed ledgers and crypto-assets rather than corporate structures and sovereign currencies. The inaugural Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index, launched in August 2021, included nine Ethereum-based projects – non-custodial exchanges as well as lending and derivatives platforms. Each project is governed, at least in part, by unregistered holders of tokenised voting rights (also known as governance tokens). Token-holders typically vote for or against coders’ improvement proposals that pertain to anything from the allocation of treasury funds to a collateral’s risk parameters. DeFi’s governance thus depends on the distribution and exercise of tokenised voting rights. Since archetypal DeFi projects are not managed by companies or public institutions, not much is known about DeFi’s governance. Regulators and law-makers from the United States recently asked if DeFi’s governance entails a new class of “shadowy” elites. In response, we conducted an exploratory multiple-case study that focused on the tokenised voting rights issued by the nine projects from Bloomberg’s inaugural Galaxy DeFi index. Our mixed methods approach drew on Ethereum-based data about the distribution, trading, staking, and delegation of voting rights tokens, as well as project documentation and archival records. We discovered that DeFi projects’ voting rights are highly concentrated, and the exercise of these rights is very low. Our theoretical contribution is a philosophical intervention: minority rule, not “democracy”, is the probable outcome of token-tradable voting rights and a lack of applicable anti-concentration laws. We interpret DeFi’s minority rule as timocratic.}

abstract = {Scientific publication and its Peer Review system strongly rely on a few major industry players controlling most journals (e.g. Elsevier), databases (e.g. Scopus) and metrics (e.g. JCR Impact Factor), while keeping most articles behind paywalls. Critics to such system include concerns about fairness, quality, performance, cost, unpaid labor, transparency, and accuracy of the evaluation process. The Open Access movement has tried to provide free access to the published research articles, but most of the aforementioned issues remain. In such context, decentralized technologies such as blockchain offer an opportunity to experiment with new models for scientific production and dissemination relying on a decentralized infrastructure, aiming to tackle multiple of the current system shortcomings. This paper makes a proposal for an interoperable decentralized system for an open peer review ecosystem, relying on emerging distributed technologies such as blockchain and IPFS. Such system, named “Decentralized Science” (DecSci), aims to enable a decentralized reviewer reputation system, which relies on an Open Access by-design infrastructure, together with transparent governance processes. Two prototypes have been implemented: a proof-of-concept prototype to validate DecSci’s technological feasibility, and a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) prototype co-designed with journal editors. In addition, three evaluations have been carried out: an exploratory survey to assess interest on the issues tackled; two sets of interviews to confirm both the main problems for editors and to validate the MVP prototype; and a cost analysis of the main operations, both execution cost and actual price. Additionally, the paper discusses the multiple interoperability challenges such proposal faces, including an architecture to tackle them. This work finishes with a review of some of the open challenges that this ambitious proposal may face.}

Whereas centralized scheduling might find a global throughput optimum (even at high computational and implementation cost), decentralized scheduling decisions in a multi-agent system are much more manageable and agents are more robust to handle any interruptions that might take place on the production floor. Compared to a centralised architecture, the development, testing and commissioning is definitely more complex, as it requires the availability of the physical units. Yet these aspects are not visited frequently by research activities. This paper details a novel implementation approach of a multi-agent based production control, that was developed for a lab-contained production environment that serves as test-bed for decentralized scheduling algorithms, with both a nominal operational mode and a simulation mode. The latter one is introduced to ease up the deployment process of the system. The description of the new approach is illustrated with different examples.}

abstract = {This paper develops a dynamic infinite-horizon model with two layers of governments to study theoretically and quantitatively how fiscal decentralization affects local and central government debt accumulation and spending. In the model, the central government makes transfers to local governments to offset vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances. But the anticipation of transfers lowers local governments’ expected cost of borrowing and leads to overborrowing ex ante. Absent commitment, the central government over-transfers to reduce local governments’ future need to borrow, and in the equilibrium both local and central debts are inefficiently high. Consistent with empirical evidence, when fiscal decentralization widens vertical fiscal imbalances, local governments become more reliant on transfers, and both local and central debts rise. Applied to Spain, the model explains 39 percent of the rise in total government debt when the vertical fiscal imbalances widened during 1988–1996, and 18 percent of the fall in debt when the imbalances narrowed during 1996–2006.}

This enormous amount of papers calls for a more systematic approach to analyse the overall trend in this research field. A bibliometric approach based on performance analysis and network analysis techniques is used to examine the evolution of blockchain technology research. Firstly, this paper contributes to the body of literature by discussing the most influential countries, authors, subject areas and journals of the current blockchain research. Secondly, this paper identifies six main clusters of blockchain-related research contributions and, based on the analysis on centrality and density measures, it classifies research themes in motor themes, basic themes, emerging or disappearing themes, and specialised themes. Despite the majority of contributions belong to the computer science subject area, many papers belonging to the technology management subject area provide pivotal insights for practitioners and policy makers. Specifically, they may exploit the results of this research to rethink many traditional processes in the light of blockchain technology implementation, exploit the benefits of the four TRs to manage processes, automate common tasks, generate actionable results, and improve daily operations.}

Based on a comprehensive county-level dataset and difference-in-difference approach, I evaluate the overall as well as heterogenous effect of upgrading policy between 1993 and 1997 on local economic development. The policy impacts are most pronounced in eastern regions and counties with higher initial agglomeration level. While the effect on economic development is insignificant in middle and western regions, it greatly expanded local bureaucracy size in these areas. I discuss the potential channels of policy effects under a simple decentralization framework with heterogeneous regions. These findings suggest that decentralization might generate entirely different consequences, relying on the level of local development potential. For this reason, it is important for the policy makers to fully take into account regional heterogeneity in optimizing decentralization policy.}

These IoT devices are often heterogeneous in nature, only to receive updates at infrequent intervals, and can remain ‘out of sight’ on a home or office network for extended periods. In other words, security and privacy are two key (research and operational) challenges in IoT systems. In recent years, there have been attempts to design deep learning-based solutions to mitigate limitations associated with detection systems designed for typical operational technology (OT) systems, although a number of challenges remain. This paper proposes a federated-based approach that employs a deep autoencoder to detect​ botnet attacks using on-device decentralized traffic data. Through the suggested federated solution, privacy is addressed by ensuring the device’s data is not transferred or moved off the network edge. Instead, the machine learning computation itself is brought to where the data is born (i.e. the edge layer), with the added benefit of data security. We demonstrate that using our proposed model, we can achieve up to 98% accuracy rate in the anomaly detection when using features such as source IP, MAC-IP, and destination IP, etc., for training. The overall comparative performance analysis between our decentralized proposed approach and a centralized format demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy rate of attack detection.}

Basically, these projects involve three main actors that may have conflicting interests regarding the ownership and exploitation of the generated data: public administrations, service providers and citizens. Nevertheless, this is not a new problem. Actually, the most popular communication systems on the Internet, such as social networks, often have issues of this kind that can become highly visible in the press, especially when service providers, who commonly store data generated by their users via centralized models, have a security issue leading to a massive data leak, or when providers take advantage of their dominant position to exploit data improperly or sell it to third parties. This paper proposes an architecture to create user-centric data management applications for communications in smart cities where data is stored and managed in a decentralized way to reduce dependency on service providers and return control of the data to the different actors involved in the communications. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed architecture is implemented, using Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the main tools, to demonstrate its feasibility, show concrete protocols, and discuss the proposal on an empirical basis.}

Even though it brings several benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the single point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down all network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can access to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation owing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the Northbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network topology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even worse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller. Hence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN’s Northbound. Furthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during data exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations, we introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized authentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to assist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With strict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for each request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing over-privileged activities or security policy conflicts. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we also implement a prototype of this framework to evaluate the security impact, effectiveness, and performance through typical use cases.}

abstract = {This chapter explores the electricity sector of Latvia, the European Union’s (EU) policy on clean energy, electricity, and smart technologies, the relationship developed between them, and the feasibility of smart grids’ and other new tools and technologies’ popularization in the context of the Latvian electricity market. As a member state of the EU, Latvia must follow the decentralization agenda, while increasing its use of encouraging renewable energy sources and establish better interconnection of electricity between its neighboring member states. In this context, this chapter explores the electricity market of Latvia, taking into account promising policies introduced by the EU that aim to incorporate new technologies such as storage solutions and the creation of smart grids. The chapter looks at how the priority of decentralized energy is being achieved in Latvia. It explores the current domestic energy market in Latvia, the current remarkable achievements in energy decentralization in terms of policy and legislation, as well as unique obstacles that have become apparent. It assesses new technologies and novel projects introduced to incentivize or further develop such technologies, namely, smart metering systems, electric mobility, demand response, and electricity storage technologies. The chapter also looks at data protection concerns and the possibility of a place in the market for the new clean energy sources. The chapter concludes with the domestic reality in Latvia and outlines a set of recommendations to facilitate the introduction of new technologies in the energy sector and how to further implement the decentralization of the electricity market.}

Using difference-in-differences approach, we find that 1) export enterprises generate more patents, after the municipal taxation bureaus delegated the authority of export tax rebate approval to lower governments. 2) Placebo tests by falsifying the pilot time and cities establish the causality. 3) The effect is particularly more pronounced for export enterprises with higher financial constraints, higher information asymmetry and weaker relationship with local governments. Overall, this study provides new insight about the real effect of the decentralization of government activities on firm innovations, which may be of interest to regulators who are concerned with the authority delegation and simplification of administrative procedures.}

This paper presents a four-layer optimization model for Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to efficiently manage network congestion through smart prosumers. The first two layers involve an iterative bidding process in the energy market to maximize social welfare during settlement. The third and fourth layers address congestion in the market, employing an adaptive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for decentralized coordination between DSOs and smart prosumers, including Microgrids (MGs), Energy Hubs (EHs), and Electric Vehicle Parking lots (EVPLs). Layer 1 optimizes market player bids, layer 2 maximizes social welfare, layer 3 handles congestion using various strategies, and layer 4 reschedules smart prosumers based on DSO's requests. Implemented on a 118-bus DS in GAMS, the model demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed adaptive ADMM in ensuring player privacy and market efficiency. Additionally, integrating the market-based mechanism with Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration (DFR) optimally utilizes smart prosumers, resulting in a 46.85% reduction in net DSO costs. This practical implication underscores the model's effectiveness in addressing network congestion challenges and providing economic benefits for DSOs.}

abstract = {Decentralized aquifer recharge programs are an alternative to centralized stormwater aquifer recharge systems and can improve groundwater tables in urban areas. In a decentralized aquifer recharge program, households and property-owners collect and store rainwater from rooftops and replenish aquifers through small gravity-fed recharge wells. This research presents a micro-trading rainwater for aquifer recharge (MRAR) system as a decentralized peer-to-peer water market that can recharge groundwater resources. Through a decentralized water market, households act as prosumers who collect and sell rainwater to consumer households and convey traded water via a shared aquifer. This research develops an agent-based modeling framework as an approach to evaluate the performance of a MRAR system to replenish groundwater resources and reduce energy required to pump water. Agents represent (1) prosumers that collect rainwater, sell rainwater to consumers, and replenish the groundwater system through dry wells, and (2) consumers that exert irrigation demands, buy rainwater from prosumers, and pump water from the groundwater system. The agent-based model is coupled with a groundwater flow model to evaluate the effects of micro-trading on groundwater resources. The agent-based modeling framework is applied for a virtual city to assess the performance of a MRAR system for scenarios that vary in the ratio of consumers to prosumers, location of prosumers and consumers, and aquifer properties. Model outcomes demonstrate the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers based on the volume of traded water, improvements in groundwater head, and improvements in unit energy of water. Findings demonstrate that the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers is consistent across different values for hydraulic conductivity. The location of prosumer and consumer households affects the unit energy of water and has a negligible effect on the groundwater table and total energy consumed to pump water. This manuscript proposes and demonstrates MRAR as a new decentralized water system and provides a modeling approach to assess the performance of a MRAR system to improve urban groundwater resources.}

The aim of the research is to find out the role of local society groups – students, their parents and principals – in the decision-making process, and their influence on the development of decentralized general education. The opinions of different actor groups are compared in order to find out their attitude to the decentralization processes of general education promoted by the LEA, and analyse the possible factors that influence the actor groups in the administrative decision-making processes which are used in the development of the LEA's policy and strategies.Quantitative and qualitative data collection methods are used – polls and profound interviews. The approach of the actor network theory is used in the research, which gives an opportunity to create an actor network for the decentralization process of general education. The most important actor groups in the process of decentralization have been identified. The results of the research show that in order to achieve the goals of development of general education, it is necessary to estimate the optimal degree of decentralization of educational management. The results of the research also show that sociological research gives substantial support to the planning of the development of general education towards decentralization and the achievement of the set aims.}

Patent examiners are usually overworked to evaluate inventions referring to a large volume of prior arts in a short period. Such increasing workloads and documents may cause administrative inefficiencies and generate low-quality IPs that hamper technological innovation. Moreover, today's centralized IP administration system is inefficient in processing speed, security, and cost. Inefficiencies of IP administration in each national IP office impede speedy and efficient cooperation for international application and registration. This study proposes an IP decentralized ledger (IP dLedger) based on the blockchain to significantly reduce IP administration costs and improve IP use. IP dLedger connects the on-chain (blockchain) to the off-chain (centralized database) systems using IP codes that combine hash values and timestamps. Similar to the web hypertext method, this connective feature of IP dLedger enables users who click on identification information registered in a blockchain network to access, through a hyperlink, a centralized database of enormous volumes of related IP information. Therefore, IP dLedger can reduce IP administration costs, increase IP usage, and facilitate safe and convenient use of the IP data.}

abstract = {Digitalization will play a vital role in the achievement of successful transitions towards more flexible, reliable and sustainable energy systems. The progressive availability of data from meters and sensors deployed across end-users and energy supply-chains constitute a first step towards this direction. Leveraging on such cross-sectorial trend, business developers find in decentralized ledger technologies (DLTs) – such as the blockchain – opportunities for value creation across a broad range of participants in energy systems. Peer-to-peer energy trading platforms interconnect legacy and novel participants leveraging renewable and storage capacity (small and utility-scale) with grid operators and within local microgrids or markets. In this way, near real time (bi-directional) exchanges can be secured and validated via tokenization and smart contracting. The proposed configurations enable governance arrangements between legacy and novel participants at the platform and sectorial level. This paper focuses on investigating the decentralized governance characteristics proposed by peer-to-peer energy trading platforms and briefly discusses their implications on legacy systems from a broad ‘relational’ (i.e. actor network, sociotechnical transitions) and ‘normative’ (i.e. energy justice) set of theories. The paper draws upon prior surveys and publicly available whitepapers from business initiatives (start-ups). For the purposes of this study, whitepapers constitute official written texts and potential sources of information for the study of emergent ways of governance and collective action leveraging this technology. Results from ground theory method (qualitative) leveraging an inductive content analysis approach, built four (4) main categories that explain: (1) the digital features of these platforms, (2) the participants and incentives involved (3) the purposes and benefits of the solutions and, (4) the governance dynamics arising from trading tokenized energy via smart contracting. Results reveal complex multi-level socio-technical interrelations at different layers and points towards opportunities for private and community-based solutions, end-user empowerment, democratic energy systems and polycentric governance while considering fractal planning in policy design.}

The earliest of the applications were built for large machines like the main frame as access to sophisticated hardware was privileged. However, with the PC boom, applications moved to smaller machines. Rudimentary word processors and standalone database applications like FORTRAN and DBase found their way into the PC screens. These applications had their own installation and upgrade challenges. Patch management and security updates were a maintenance nightmare. Slowly with improved network speeds, the design philosophy changed and centralized systems working on the client-server architecture ruled the roost and are till date the dominant architecture for middle-to-large-scale applications. However, the vertical scaling could only go as long, and with the increased data and large user base, there was a requirement to grow horizontally. Data grew and databases started bursting on the seams. Big Data was the new norm, and to handle the vast amounts of data, scaling vertically wasn’t just enough. Google has often been credited for pioneering work in horizontal scaling just out of sheer necessity to handle large volumes of data. In this chapter, we intend discussing the paradigm shift in application development from centralized to decentralized and give a brief overview of Ethereum.}

We suggest a family of decentralized two-stage mechanisms, in which agents first announce preferred individual workloads and then bargain over the induced joint cost savings. The second-stage negotiations depend on the first-stage announcements as specified through the mechanism’s recognition function. We characterize mechanisms that incentivize cost-effective task allocation and further single out a particular mechanism, which additionally ensures a fair distribution of the system-wide cost savings.}

In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures. The performance of the smart contracts was evaluated on three different global Ethereum blockchain test networks with the centrality and dispersion statistics on their performance provided as a reference benchmark for future smart contract implementations.}

In the nine changes studied across seven companies, the decentralization process also required the CPO to address a number of simultaneous activities, including cost reduction objectives and implementation of information technology systems.

This paper demonstrates the feasibility and potential of employing SR to fight fires autonomously, with a focus on the self-coordination mechanisms for the desired firefighting behaviour to emerge. Thus, an efficient physics-based model of fire propagation and a self-organisation algorithm for swarms of firefighting drones are developed and coupled, with the collaborative behaviour based on a particle swarm algorithm adapted to individuals operating within physical dynamic environments of high severity and frequency of change. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed self-organising system is effective, scalable and fault-tolerant, comprising a promising approach to dealing with the suppression of wildfires – one of the world's most pressing challenges of our time.}

Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric’s test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.}

The study administered a questionnaire to 349 representatives of households in Juba County's Rejaf and Luri payams and interviewed 41 key informants in these payams and within the Juba City Council. The survey respondents were selected using the multi-stage sampling technique, while the key informants were purposively selected based on their experience with the subject matter. The survey data were analysed using SPSS, while the qualitative data were analysed using narrative and content analysis techniques. The study reveals that decentralization's overall contribution to ethnic conflict resolution in Juba County is marginal because it has not been implemented as planned, making people associate it with reducing local autonomy, and exacerbating impunity of high-profile people, rampant land disputes, grand corruption, tribalism and nepotism, and unbalanced development. Nevertheless, decentralization has made local authorities more responsive to citizens' needs than central government officials, increased inter-ethnic unity, and enhanced citizens' participation in decision-making processes, among others. The study concludes that decentralization's effectiveness in ending ethnic conflicts in South Sudan requires complete devolution where the central government not only vests local governments with political and administrative powers but also fiscal and legal authority. Then, there must be a robust system of downward and upward accountability in the confines of rule of law, to make everyone abide by societal standards and norms, and end injustices that allegedly push people to pursue their rights violently.}

abstract = {This chapter explores the electricity sector of Portugal; the European Union’s (EU) policy on clean energy, electricity, and smart technologies; the relationship developed between them; and the feasibility of smart grids’ and other new tools and technologies’ popularization in the context of the Portuguese electricity market. As a member state of the EU, Portugal must follow the decentralization agenda, while increasing its use of encouraging renewable energy sources and establishing better interconnection of electricity with its neighbor Spain. In this context, this chapter explores the electricity market of Portugal, taking into account promising policies introduced by the EU that aim to incorporate new technologies such as storage solutions and the creation of smart grids. The chapter looks at how the priority of decentralized energy is being achieved in Portugal. It explores the current domestic energy market in Portugal, the current remarkable achievements in energy decentralization in terms of policy and legislation, as well as unique obstacles that have become apparent. It assesses new technologies and novel projects introduced to incentivize or further develop such technologies, namely, smart metering systems, electric mobility, demand response, and electricity storage technologies. The chapter also looks at data protection concerns, the interconnection between the electricity markets of Portugal and Spain, and the possibility of a place in the market for the new clean energy sources. The chapter concludes with the domestic reality in Portugal and outlines a set of recommendations to facilitate the introduction of new technologies in the energy sector and how to further implement the decentralization of the electricity market.}

abstract = {Small-scale data centers at the edge are becoming prominent in offering various services to the end-users following the cloud model while avoiding the high latency inherent to the classic cloud environments when accessed from remote Internet regions. However, we should address several challenges to facilitate the end-users finding and consuming the relevant services from the edge at the Internet scale. First, the scale and diversity of the edge hinder seamless access. Second, a framework where researchers openly share their services and data in a secured manner among themselves and with external consumers over the Internet does not exist. Third, the lack of a unified interface and trust across the service providers hinder their interchangeability in composing workflows by chaining the services. Thus, creating a workflow from the services deployed on the various edge nodes is presently impractical. This paper designs Viseu, a latency-aware blockchain framework to provide Virtual Internet Services at the Edge. Viseu aims to solve the puzzle of network service discovery at the edge, considering the peers’ reputation and latency when choosing the service instances. Viseu enables peers to share their computational resources, services, and data among each other in an untrusted environment, rather than relying on a set of trusted service providers. By composing workflows from the peers’ services, rather than confining them to the pre-established service provider and consumer roles, Viseu aims to facilitate scientific collaboration across the peers natively. Furthermore, by offering services from multiple peers close to the end-users, Viseu also minimizes end-to-end latency and data loss in the service execution at the Internet scale.}

In order to detect and isolate faults, a set of fault sensitive residuals are generated based on the divergence of Jensen Shannon (DJS) between the probability distributions predicted by the encoder based evolution model and the various observations obtained by sensors. Then, in order to detect a fault, a data-driven approach is applied, where the classification of faults is done by a pre-trained detection decision tree (D-DT) and isolation random forest (I-RF). The testing and evaluation of the approach is done on real data from three Turtlebot3 burger robot equipped with wheel encoders (for prediction), a gyroscope (for the yaw angle) and a Marvelmind (for the absolute position).

abstract = {Traditional power grids, being highly centralized in terms of generation, economy, and operation, continually employed probabilistic methods to account for load uncertainties. In modern smart grids (SG), rapid proliferation of non-dispatchable generation (physical decentralization) and liberal markets (market decentralization) leads to dismantling of the centralized paradigm, with operation being performed by several decentralized agents. Handling uncertainty in this new paradigm is aggravated due to 1) a vastly increased number of uncertainty sources, and 2) decentralized agents only having access to local data and limited information on other parts of the grid. A major problem identified in modern and future SGs is the need for fully decentralized optimal operation techniques that are computationally efficient, highly accurate, and do not jeopardize data privacy and security of individual agents. Machine learning (ML) techniques, being successors to traditional probabilistic methods are identified as a solution to this problem. In this paper, a conceptual model is constructed for the transition from a fully centralized operation of a SG to a decentralized one, proposing the transition scheme between the two paradigms. A novel ML algorithm for fully decentralized operation is proposed, formulated, implemented, and tested. The proposed algorithm relies solely on local historical data for local agents to accurately predict their optimal control actions without knowledge of the physical system model or access to historical data of other agents. The capability of cloud-based cooperative information exchange was augmented through a new concept of s-index activation codes, being encoded vectors shared between agents to improve their operation without sharing raw information. The algorithm is tested on a modified IEEE 24-bus test system and synthetically generating historical data based on typical load profiles. A week-ahead high-resolution (15-minute) fully decentralized operation case is tested. The algorithm is shown to guarantee less than 0.1% error compared to a centralized solution and to outperform a neural network (NN). The algorithm is exceptionally accurate while being highly computationally efficient and has great potential as a versatile model for fully decentralized operation of SGs.}

These systems have positive societal impacts in terms of sustainability and consumer empowerment, but they are not accessible to all and their deployment may increase socio-economic inequalities. The societal impacts of decentralised energy systems can be understood in terms of conflicting capabilities; for some citizens capabilities may increase, whereas for others they may decrease. While problematic, capability conflicts may not be inherent. They may only occur in certain neighbourhoods, for example, where both affluent and less affluent populations coexist. By understanding why these capability conflicts occur, we may be able to anticipate whether these decentralised energy projects could result in societal problems. We use agent-based modelling and the scenario discovery technique to identify capability conflicts and the populations that may be affected. We distinguish five classes of conflicts, which can be used to anticipate social acceptance issues. Affected populations can be involved in the decision-making process to foster acceptance of decentralised energy systems. This work contributes to the growing political and scientific debate on issues of energy justice and inclusiveness related to the energy transition. Additionally, we contribute to the operationalisation of such capabilities, as this is one of the first papers to formalise the Capability Approach using an agent-based model.}

Key Management (KM) is particularly a difficult security issue, mainly because of the lack of resources of the IoT devices. Most of the existing solutions do not consider the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the IoT. They do not regard the difference in capability of its components and impose equal loads on them. Moreover, they store keys in device memories before deployment, which makes adding devices difficult afterwards. We propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based KM protocol for the IoT. Our solution balances the loads between nodes according to their capabilities. We prove that this makes it efficient and scalable. Furthermore, our solution securely rekey the network upon a change. To decentralize the KM, we use the blockchain technology and smart contracts. We show that the system continues to operate when an entity fails and that the compromise of an entity does not jeopardize the whole network. We also prove that our solution fulfills the IoT requirements in terms of security and performance. Finally, we propose an implementation on IoT platforms to validate our theoretical analysis and simulation results.}

abstract = {The inter-vehicle communication in the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) providing ubiquitous mobility to mobile users is considered an essential component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), enabling a wide range of safety and non-safety applications in which the vehicles seamlessly interact and co-operate with each other. The recent paradigm shift in VANETs protocols has led to the adoption of name data networking (NDN) as an underlying communication protocol in VANETs that replaces traditional address-based communication philosophy, treats content as a first-class citizen, and assigns unique names to contents consequently enabling name-based routing and forwarding, caching, and security. Although NDN has significantly improved the underlying communication issues in VANETs, a plethora of challenges such as message broadcast storms, in-efficient packet suppression mechanisms, intermittent connectivity owing to frequent topological changes, and reverse path partioning (RPP) require further attention from the research community. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes decentralized receiver-based link stability-aware forwarding (DRLSF) protocol. The DRLSF is a beacon-less receiver-based multi-hop protocol, well-suited for pull-based applications where end users request desired data by sending packets. The comparative performance analysis validates the effectiveness of the DRLSF protocol in different VANET environments and application scenarios.}

Together with ubiquitous digitalisation, this decentralisation and flexibility at the demand side paves the way towards local energy communities and in its most distributed version to peer-to-peer energy trading, where customers buy and sell electricity among each other. Although peer-to-peer energy trading is not yet legal everywhere, citizen energy communities have been introduced as cornerstones of the energy transition by the European Commission in their Clean Energy for All Europeans programme. This paper firstly discusses this digitalisation and decentralisation of the power infrastructure. These trends are supported by distributed information technologies, including peer-to-peer control paradigms. Distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchains, might be one such piece of the puzzle. The second part of the paper investigates whether blockchain technologies, and their associated smart contracts, offer advantages for larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications over a classic, centralised approach. Different blockchain implementations are investigated and qualitatively evaluated from a scalability, efficiency and trust perspective. The conclusion indicates that in the current state of the art, a trade-off between decentralised and more classical (hierarchically centralised) solutions suits larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications best.}

This has generated a management dilemma for national fisheries enforcement, due to ambiguity in implementation and legislation among agencies. Through a case study in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve, in the Yucatan Peninsula, we explore how local actors have addressed problems resulting from the implementation of these decentralized policies. We focus on local Community Surveillance Committees to understand how cooperation occurs at the local level to enforce fisheries regulations. Through a systematic review of fisheries policies in Mexico, we describe the political context to understand the implications of decentralization. The first author conducted ethnographic fieldwork from 2013 to 2017 in three fishing communities and attended meetings with actors involved in local fisheries management. As part of fieldwork, 42 in-depth interviews with fishers and representatives from state agencies were conducted. Using a polycentric approach, we look beyond the performance of individual fishing cooperatives to focus on the relationships among governance actors. We found factors strengthening the Sian Ka'an surveillance system are local actors' capacity to create rules, their relative autonomy from the government, and the existence of more than one decision-making center. We highlight that ambiguity in the implementation of decentralization also enabled local actors to be innovative and fill gaps in the national fisheries policies enforcement system, through diverse configurations of institutional arrangements. In this case study, those arrangements are the result of a constant process of social innovation and improvement in the fishery's organization.}

Globally, these services are undergoing major transformative processes such as digitalization, decentralization, or integrated management. Such processes not only depend on technical changes in infrastructure systems but also include important social and socio-technical dimensions. In this article, we propose a socio-technical network perspective to study the ensemble of social actors and technical elements involved in an infrastructure system, and their complex relations. We conceptualize structurally explicit socio-technical networks of networked infrastructure systems based on methodological considerations from network analysis and draw on concepts from socio-technical system theories and social-ecological network studies. Based on these considerations, we suggest analytical methods to study basic network concepts such as density, reciprocity, and centrality in a socio-technical network. We illustrate socio-technical motifs, i.e., meaningful sub-structures in socio-technical networks of infrastructure management. Drawing on these, we describe how infrastructure systems can be analyzed in terms of digitalization, decentralization, and integrated management from a socio-technical network perspective. Using the example of urban wastewater systems, we illustrate an empirical application of our approach. The results of an empirical case study in Switzerland demonstrate the potential of socio-technical networks to promote a deeper understanding of complex socio-technical relations in networked infrastructure systems. We contend that such a deeper understanding could improve management practices of infrastructure systems and is becoming even more important for enabling future data-driven, decentralized, and more integrated infrastructure management.}

A task-assignment algorithm identifies those satellites that need to be rearranged in order to minimize the total propellant consumption. The decision process relies on convex optimization procedures which estimate control laws and maneuvering trajectories, accounting for thruster technology constraints and collision avoidance. The path-planning has a twofold implementation. In the centralized approach, the reconfiguration strategy is elaborated by a single unit: the maneuvering trajectories are generated considering solely collision avoidance constraints at expenses of computational costs. The alternative method is conceived such that each satellite autonomously determines its tasks. This de-centralized architecture allows the algorithm to run faster, but entails a higher traffic on the intersatellite communication link. In addition, collision avoidance is approximated to make each optimization independent from the other. For preliminary validation of the developed routines, a specific mission scenario is considered, with a distributed Synthetic Aperture Radar in a low Earth orbit that has to be reconfigured for tomographic applications. Simulation results show that, once remote-sensing requirements are specified within the limits set by standard products, the developed algorithms can manage autonomously the maneuver towards the corresponding operative pattern. In details, the centralized approach allows the reconfiguration to be handled with mean delta-v savings around 30%. On the contrary, strategies are elaborated by the decentralized planners about 7 times faster.}

abstract = {With the widespread application of distributed power generation, traditional energy consumers are becoming active prosumers. Giving full play to the role of the electricity market in resource allocation, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading between multiple prosumers and consumers helps increase the revenue of electricity sales and reduce the cost of electricity consumption. The participation of flexible resources in P2P energy trading achieves local power complementarity, improves benefits, and reduces the operating pressure of lines. To ensure the benefits of prosumers and stimulate their enthusiasm, it is necessary to propose an effective trading strategy to fully allow flexible resources to participate in P2P energy trading. Therefore, this paper establishes a P2P energy market based on the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) theory, we propose a minimum cost rolling optimization model to optimize the bidding quantity of flexible resources. Moreover, the Automatic Learning (AL) pricing strategy with privacy and learning is proposed. The AL bidding price strategy enables interactive learning among prosumers. In addition, the influence of bidding price on bidding quantity during the trading process is also considered. Furthermore, this paper considers the impact of renewable energy source (RES) uncertainty on the bidding decisions of prosumers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by the simulation results of cases. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the benefits for prosumers, enhance the local balance ability, achieve price learning, and increase the transaction rate.}

The idea consists of considering the system of group of robots as a robot network with decentralized architecture. Each robot plans its trajectory according to its actual position, the position of the other neighbor robots, the position of the obstacles and the position of its target point. So each robot should interact with the other robots in the network to cooperate together in order to plan each robot trajectory. The path planning for every robot is planned based on the potential field approach. The network reacts with the changes of workspace in real time by updating the system equations associated for each robot. The main objective of this work is to avoid collision between robots and obstacles in order to ensure the safety of robots. The solution is tested and simulated with Matlab/Simulink and Solidworks/Simmechanics.}

abstract = {Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for wireless decentralized networks in IoT have attracted a lot of attention in both academic and industrial fields. They aim to coordinate access among IoT devices to the shared wireless medium. More specifically, contention-free MAC protocols are known to be more efficient than contention-based ones in the case of high traffic load and dense networks. To face the main communication challenges between IoT devices such as collisions and conflicts as well as mobility, it is crucial to design an efficient MAC protocol. To do so, several solutions have been proposed in the literature. Among recent proposed solutions, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and game theory models were used to revolutionize the communication in IoT networks, especially for devices with high mobility degree. In our survey, we first start by studying the challenges and requirements of communication in wireless networks. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent contention-free MAC protocols existing in the literature. Next, we compare these solutions based on important metrics such as QoS, robustness, fairness etc., and discuss the relationship between MAC protocols, network type and network mobility. Finally, we investigate a future research direction to solve a major problem, which is the network disruption and delay tolerance in IoT wireless mobile networks.}

The main interest in these systems is to understand how from simple rules inspired by the division of labor in social insects, a group of robots can perform tasks in an organized and coordinated way. We take into account a specifically distributed or decentralized approach as we are particularly interested in experimenting with truly autonomous and decentralized techniques in which the robots themselves are responsible for choosing a particular task in an autonomous and individual way. Under this approach we can speak of multi-task selection instead of multi-task assignment, which means, that the agents or robots select the tasks instead of being assigned a task by a central controller. In this regard, we have established an experimental scenario to solve the corresponding multi-task distribution problem and we propose a solution using different approaches by applying the response threshold models inspired by division of labor in social insects, the application of the reinforcement learning algorithm based on learning automata theory and ant colony optimization-based deterministic algorithms. We have evaluated the robustness of the algorithms, perturbing the number of pending loads to simulate the robot׳s error in estimating the real number of pending tasks and also the dynamic generation of loads through time. The paper ends with a critical discussion of experimental results.}

This introduces opportunities to rapidly construct new applications by interconnecting these microservices in different workflow configurations. The challenge is to discover the required microservices, including those from trusted partners and the wider community, whilst being able to operate robustly under diverse networking conditions. This paper outlines a workflow approach that provides decentralized discovery and orchestration of verifiably trustable services in support of multi-party operations. The approach is based on adoption of patterns from self-sovereign identity research, notably Verifiable Credentials, to share information amongst peers based on attestations of service descriptions and prior service usage in a privacy preserving and secure manner. This provides a dynamic, trust-based framework for ratifying and evaluating the qualities of different services. Collating these new service descriptions and integrating with existing decentralized workflow research based on vector symbolic architecture (VSA) provides an enhanced semantic search space for efficient and trusted service discovery that is necessary to support a diverse range of emerging edge-computing environments. An architecture for a dynamic decentralized service discovery system, is designed, and described through application to a scenario which uses trusted peers’ reported experiences of an anomaly detection service to determine service selection.}

This paper presents a new strategy for formation control of multiple mobile robots to capture a target including self organization. A decentralized formation control is proposed to make the system more reliable and fault-tolerant. Acting on a hostile environnement, each robot of the formation has to avoid an obstacle. For that, we propose a new technique that modifies the trajectory behavior while preserving the formation convergence. LaSalle's theorem is applied to construct the proposed smooth continuous feedback control, to surround the target. The validity of convergence and obstacle avoidance is supported by computer simulation.}

This trend urges energy industries toward the deployment of disparate energy sources with considerable emphasis on renewables with decentralized nature. In such circumstances, future power systems will be faced with a great complexity, dimensionality, uncertainties, and curse of big data. Challenges in this environment have been the basis and motivation for this chapter and other chapters of the book. Traditional decision-making in power systems is done with a centralized approach, as this approach has faced many problems with the complexity of the network and the penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in present power industries. In such an environment, the utilization of decentralized decision-making (DDM) in future power systems to tackle far more sophisticated issues and problems will be an attractive and a relevant framework. In this chapter, first, a brief overview of energy trend in future is addressed and then in the remaining parts of the chapter, the DDM approach and its applications in future power systems are discussed. One of the issues that become more important with the expansion of DERs is the increase in information and the complexity of the network. Information security is another challenge in future power systems whereby entities are reluctant to share their information with users and as a result the decision-making process will face a high degree of complexity. Increased data in the system is another challenge for future power systems. Extracting and analyzing the required information is a time-consuming and complex process. All of these issues complicate future power systems, which necessitates addressing the concept of decentralized frameworks for future power systems. This chapter and particularly the book provide a comprehensive breakdown of the future power system contexts including applications of DDM approach in future power systems.}

Moreover, failure in network infrastructure, hardware and software of resource can force it to leave grid without any early warnings. Many authors have proposed decentralized scheduling algorithms for P2P grid. In this paper, we have proposed a fault tolerant decentralized scheduling algorithm for P2P grid, which reschedules jobs of grid resource when node failure happens. This mechanism handles node failure in fully decentralized manner. Key feature of this fault tolerant approach is that, it reschedules jobs depending upon communication and computation cost associated with jobs.}

The aim of this paper is to discuss specifics of various dimensions of the centralization and decentralization in the rural educational landscape of post-socialist countries using the example of Czechia. Based on the concept of landscape structures, we recommend the categorization of educational landscape processes into three groups: 1) the centralization of educational function, 2) the centralization of curriculum development, and 3) the centralization of educational governance and organization. The research was based on the spatial analysis of main school characteristics and the research results were interpreted within the context of main principles of organization of the elementary education system as identified in educational sciences or as declared in policy and strategic documents. While school concentration and the closures of small schools in rural areas are still widely discussed issues in many countries, in Czechia this dimension of centralization was basically completed in the 1970s. Centralization, which affected primarily rural schools, stood for ideal power control over the organization of curriculum and over school governance in the period of state socialism. After 1989, reflecting the country's overall democratization, the previous method of educational organization was rejected and replaced with highly decentralized approaches to curriculum and the governance of schools. Not the state but municipality authorities became primarily responsible for operating schools. At the same time, schools entered an educational market competing for pupils, which was again disadvantageous for rural schools.}

However, providing overwhelming or sometimes unnecessary information can also confuse users and cause failure. For these reasons, this paper proposes a decentralized method to aggregate explanations sent by remote agents to human users according to the user's wishes and needs. To this end, the paper relies on the holonic multi-agent system to hierarchically decompose the environment and enables the aggregation of the explanations. The proposal is tested in a small scenario and outlines explanations at diferent levels of detail from microscopic to macroscopic.}

However, decentralized trust management is a preferable solution, but it implies a considerable consumption of energy. Consumption is further exacerbated by the means needed to protect from attacks the trust management entities themselves. This work proposes suitable trust management for the IoT and IoV by exploiting the eventual consistency and security guarantees of blockchain.

Such missions need onboard planning to avoid communication delays caused by the long distance between the probes and the Earth. However, the traditional centralized planning approaches will burden the manager probe with a high computing load and make the system liable to a single-point failure. A decentralized onboard planning system based on privacy-preserving multi-agent negotiation is proposed to address this problem. The Privacy-preserving Decentralized Multi-Agent Mission Planning Frame (PDMA-MPF) is designed, in which the concepts of private agent and public agent are proposed for the first time. Based on the planning frame, the Decentralized Multi-Agent Iterative Negotiation Task Allocation Method (DMAIN) is developed to allocate tasks and generate local plans for probes. The method uses a deferred-acceptance negotiation pattern, considering the mission profit and load balancing of probes. An information consistency mechanism is designed for the public data synchronization of planners. The local planning of probes is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem with profit optimization. A temporal constraint handling algorithm and a Resource Rate Timeline (RRTL) based resource constraint handling algorithm are proposed to satisfy constraints in a profit optimized way. The planning system verification shows that the proposed system can generate reasonable plans and guarantee public data consistency between planners. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed planning system gets higher mission profits and a more balanced workload of probes, as compared with the traditional Hierarchical Greedy Algorithm.}

To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.}

The aim of this study is to characterise those initiatives promoting decentralised renewable energy and to assess their potential role in inducing the wider transformation of the Argentinian energy system. To achieve this, we apply conceptualisations for the development of sociotechnical niches and use qualitative research techniques to characterise the sociotechnical dynamics of the decentralised renewable energy sector in Argentina. A niche in an advanced stage of development, in which lessons are systematically aggregated in networks, was identified and examples of generic lessons being used to frame new projects or programmes were also found. In addition to considering the internal niche development processes, we investigate how external factors affect the development of the niche. Finally, we suggest two possible development pathways by which the niche might exert stronger influence on the broader sustainability transformation of the Argentinian power system.}

abstract = {Emerging decentralised electricity systems require new approaches to energy governance. As energy sources shift and technology evolves, electricity governance is shifting from largely centralized models to include multiple decentralised and multi-level sites not bounded in their operations by established democratic processes. New forms of accountability are required to ensure that multi-level electricity systems meet societal needs and expectations. While multi-level governance dynamics are new for many electricity systems, they are common across other resources (e.g. water). This article uses an OECD framework that synthesizes decades of research on multi-level natural resource governance to describe 12 principles for “good” resource governance. These principles are developed and applied to decentralising electricity governance contexts in order to develop mechanisms, and identify potential governance gaps, that are relevant for ensuring accountability in decentralised electricity governance systems. The nature of decentralised electricity systems particularly highlights the need to rescale many governance functions, while paying attention to issues of inclusion, capacity building, coherence, adaptiveness, and transparency.}

abstract = {This paper critically examines the impact of decentralisation on contemporary and future governance arrangements in Ghana's artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector. The sector, while providing valuable employment in rural areas, is beleaguered by environmental and social issues. Proponents of decentralisation argue that re-distributing decision-making authority leads to more responsive, transparent and efficient natural resource management. The analysis presented here, however, demonstrates how weak decentralisation has exacerbated the complex, conflictual and clandestine nature of local resource politics surrounding ASM. If future decentralisation reforms are going to reverse this trend and improve the governance of ASM in Ghana, then facilitating the participation of traditional authorities is imperative. It is argued that doing so requires addressing the reticence regarding the role of chiefs in resource governance; simply ironing out existing technical issues with decentralisation reforms is unlikely to improve the social and environmental performance of ASM in the country. In light of the chronic resource management deficiencies in Ghana, epitomised in the ASM sector, fostering frank political debates on resource governance is becoming urgent.}

However, these applications do not provide an open and transparent environment for public participation. This study suggests that PPGISs should be developed as decentralized applications (DApp) based on Ethereum blockchain technology to have a fully open, transparent, and accountable environment for public participation. In a blockchain-based PPGIS, the collected data are securely saved on the blockchain. The validity of the data, replicated on the nodes of the peer-to-peer blockchain network, is ensured through a consensus process without any central control. The data is tamper-free and immutable. Additionally, the data is openly accessible to institutions and citizens. A prototype PPGIS was developed as a DApp through which users can participate in the site selection of urban facilities. Using the application, they compare and rank different criteria. The system solves an analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weights of the criteria. A suitability map is generated afterward and published to be used by both citizens and decision-makers. The feasibility of the application, along with the issues that need to be considered while using blockchain technology for urban planning and development, are thoroughly discussed.}

However, centralized structures pose difficulties for organizations in adapting to a rapidly changing business environment. Here we present the Plural method which can be used to guide organizations in performing process modeling in a decentralized way. Instead of a centralized group of people understanding, modeling and improving processes, our method allows individuals to model and improve their own processes to help in fulfilling their roles in the organization. An individual model depicts a set of activities performed by a role, which together result in a cohesive service within the organization. These individual models are then integrated as necessary to show the way the organization works. We applied the Plural method in a case study of a small-size software organization. We describe the method and its underlying principles and then discuss the findings of our case study, lessons learned, and limitations. The study thus provided evidence of Plural's utility and showed how an organization might exploit its strengths.}

The rise of blockchain technology has paved the way for the development of self-sovereign identity (SSI)—a new class of user-controlled resilient identity management systems that are enabled by distributed ledger technology. This paper examines how SSI management can be used in a public transportation sector that spans different operators in multiple countries. Specifically, the paper explores how a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system can draw on the SSI framework to provide high-level security and transparency for all involved parties in public transportation ecosystems. Accordingly, building on analyses of the existing public transportation ticketing solutions, we elicited requirements of a comparable system based on the SSI principles. Next, we developed a low-fidelity prototype to showcase how passengers can utilize standardized travel credentials that are valid across different transportation networks in Europe. The proposed system eliminates the need for multiple travel cards (i.e., one for each transportation provider) and empowers individuals to have better control over the use of their identities while they utilize interoperable ticketing systems across Europe. Overall, building on the public transportation case, we offer a proof-of-concept that shows how individuals can better manage their identity credentials via the SSI framework.}

We consider the case where each controller in the decentralized setting has its own sampling and actuation frequency, which translates to asynchrony between sensors and actuators. Additionally, asynchrony may be induced by delays between the sampling instants and actuation update instants as relevant in a networked context. The decentralized, asynchronous LTI system is represented as the feedback interconnection of a continuous-time LTI system operator and an operator that captures the effects of asynchrony induced by sampling and delay. By characterizing the properties of the operators using small-gain type Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC), we provide criteria for exponential stability of the asynchronous, decentralized LTI state-space models. The approach provided in this paper considers two scenarios, namely the ‘large-delay’ case and the ‘small-delay’ case where the delays are larger and smaller than the sampling interval, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed results is corroborated by a numerical example.}

abstract = {In a decentralized household energy system comprised of various devices such as home appliances, electric vehicles, and solar panels, end-users are able to dig deeper into the system’s details and further achieve energy sustainability if they are presented with data on the electric energy consumption and production at the granularity of the device. However, many databases in this field are siloed from other domains, including solely information pertaining to energy. This may result in the loss of information (e.g. weather) on each device’s energy use. Meanwhile, a large number of these datasets have been extensively used in computational modeling techniques such as machine learning models. While such computational approaches achieve great accuracy and performance by concentrating only on a local view of datasets, model reliability cannot be guaranteed since such models are very vulnerable to data input fluctuations when information omission is taken into account. This article tackles the data isolation issue in the field of smart energy systems by examining Semantic Web methods on top of a household energy system. We offer an ontology-based approach for managing decentralized data at the device-level resolution in a system. As a consequence, the scope of the data associated with each device may easily be expanded in an interoperable manner throughout the Web, and additional information, such as weather, can be obtained from the Web, provided that the data is organized according to W3C standards.}

abstract = {The highly dynamic nature of future computing systems, where applications dynamically emerge as opportunistic aggregation of autonomous and independent resources available at any given time, requires a radical shift in the adopted computing paradigms. Indeed, they should fully reflect the decentralized perspective of the execution environment and consider QoS, scalability and resilience as key objectives. In this context, the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) paradigm, which envisions the creation of new services as an assembly of independent services available within the environment, can greatly help in tackling the challenges of developing future applications. However, in order to be effective, XaaS paradigm requires self-adaptive service assembly solutions able to cope with the unpredictable variability and scalability of the execution environment, the lack of global knowledge, and the QoS requirements of services to be built. We contribute in this direction by designing a fully decentralized and collective self-adaptive service assembly framework whose main features are: (i) self-assembly, i.e., the ability to operate autonomously, (ii) online-learning, i.e., the ability to dynamically learn from experience, (iii) QoS-awareness, i.e., the inclusion of QoS requirements as driving forces for self-assembly, (iv) scalability, i.e., the ability to cope with a large number of services, and (v) resilience, i.e., the ability to maintain the persistence of service delivery when facing unexpected changes (e.g., in the number and/or QoS of services). Simulation experiments show that our solution makes the system able to quickly converge to viable assemblies that improve and maintain over time the social welfare of the system, despite the local perspective of each participating service.}

Most of these procedures assume organizational decision models with a single overall goal that is supported by all decision makers involved. In this paper, a framework for an interactive heuristic planning procedure is proposed for decentralized organizational decision models with multiple goals that may be conflicting within and between decision levels. This procedure aims at solving the planning problem straightforwardly in a low number of information exchanges between the decision levels, which makes it more acceptable for decision makers in practice.}

Research on health sector reforms has paid scant attention to this aspect. If the claims made for decentralised management in the health sector are to be evaluated seriously, it is critical to develop concepts and methods to evaluate not only the formal organisation and the outputs of the health system, but also the aspects of local social organisation and political culture within which that local health system is embedded that may mediate their relationship. The paper explores three cases of district health systems in Northeast Brazil in order to identify aspects of local social organisation and political culture that appear to influence the implementation of the reforms and thereby potentially impact upon the quality of the care provided. The results of the study indicate the importance that aspects of local social organisation and political culture may exert on the operations of a decentralised health system. Key aspects identified are: the space for autonomy; the space for local voice in political life; personalised and institutionalised influences on autonomy and local voice; differences of involvement of health staff with the district; different spaces of acceptable practice and accountability. These factors are seen to moderate the intent of the health reforms at all stages in their implementation. Three possibilities are discussed for the nature of the interaction in terms of cause and effect between the formal organisation of the health system and its local context. Seeing this relationship as one of a dialogue offers some cautious optimism for the potential of the reform agenda. The paper closes with suggestions on how to take this line of research forward.}

Decentralized worlds are both places for users to “own” what they have in the environment in a new and more complete way and act as exchanges for the buying and selling of unique digital goods.

Electrochemical biosensors have the potential to provide rapid and inexpensive diagnostics while moving clinical testing from centralized labs to point-of-care (POC) applications. Conductive materials functionalized with bioreceptors that remain stable and functional for measurements in real-world conditions are essential for the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors, and carbon-based nanomaterials provide the electrical, chemical, structural, and mechanical features that make them suitable for POC devices. This review details the most recent developments in the use of carbon-based nanostructures, with a focus on one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, two-dimensional graphene, and graphene oxide, their interface with biological receptors, deposition on portable, flexible, and wearable substrates, and integration on low-cost platforms for detection of clinical biomarkers. The large-scale manufacturing and implementation of microneedles as implantable and electronic tattoos as wearable devices for on-skin diagnostics, and lab-on-mouth platforms as well as the interface with mobile technologies and their potential implementation for remote POC monitoring and decentralized healthcare through cloud processing and the internet of things (IoT) are discussed with examples of applications. The review concludes with an overview of the regulatory perspectives and future trends, challenges, and opportunities for commercialization and translation of these technologies from the research lab to practice, as useful diagnostic tools for remote monitoring of patient health conditions.}

In or- der to satisfy these requirements, a novel decentralized agent scheduling method for dynamic task allocation problems based on Game Descrip- tion Language (GDL) and Game Theory is proposed. Specifically, we define the task allocation problem as a stochastic game model, in which the agent's utility is derived from the marginal utility, and then prove that the global optimal task allocation scheme resides in the Nash equi- librium set by the non-cooperative game. In order to generate an optimal solution, we define Multi-agent Negotiation Game (MNG), in which ne- gotiations are held between agents to decide which tasks to act on next. Building on this, we make a simple extension to adopt GDL more suit- able for negotiations and propose to use it to model such negotiation scenarios. Finally, we use a negotiation example to show that our ap- proach is more amenable to automatic processing by autonomous agents and of great practicality than a centralized task scheduler.}

However, current practices are inadequate for both effectiveness and efficiency since they mainly depend on centralized authority. This paper is designed in two folds; first, a generic blockchain-based online dispute resolution platform is tested with two litigation cases collected in 1999 and 2009 to show the need for a construction-focused system. Then, a new construction-specific framework, Decentralized Construction Enabling Transparent Resolution (DCENTR), is proposed to address the unique nature of construction projects. Ultimately, it is shown that dispute likelihood can be minimized through reliable contract and payment execution, and if occurred, construction disputes can be resolved with higher transparency and dramatic savings in effort, time, and cost.}

abstract = {Humanitarian operations rely heavily on logistics in uncertain, risky, and urgent contexts, making them a very different field of application for supply chain management principles than that of traditional businesses. We illustrate how optimal supply chains can be designed and implemented within this sector via a study of the process through which the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) decentralized its supply chain. We examine how the process was implemented through a 10-year retrospective of the organization's evolution. We then evaluate the decentralized supply chain's performance in responding to humanitarian crises through an analysis of the IFRC's operations during the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006. This was the first operation to benefit from the support of Regional Logistics Units (RLUs), the core element of the IFRC's new decentralized supply chain for disaster relief. Our analysis demonstrates the benefits of the decentralized model in humanitarian operations. We find that its implementation requires an alignment between organizational readiness and the adoption of fundamental logistics components, namely standardized tools and processes, traceability through adapted information systems, and appropriate competencies within the organization.}

abstract = {Background
The Italian National Health Plan 2011–2013 expressly recognizes the Tallinn Charter as the most solid international reference for the definition of National priorities. At sub-national level, many regions apply performance monitoring as an integral part of quality improvement policies.
Methods
A national workshop allowed reviewing the state of the art of performance monitoring in Italian regions and Autonomous Provinces in relation to the Tallinn Charter. Participants included representatives of regions and Autonomous Provinces, the National Agency of Regional Health Services, the Italian Ministry of Health and WHO Europe. Six specific questions were used to facilitate brainstorming and to collect updated information.
Results
A total of eighteen regions out of twenty-one participated in the meeting. Ten regions were found to use different systems for performance evaluation: two adopting a unique balanced scorecard, two applying different systems for different levels of governance, six using a structured multidimensional system. Different organizational and operational capacities affect the ability to uptake information for policy making.
Conclusions
Italian regions are striving to respond to the collective need of performance improvement, through an increased production of systems of indicators and achievement reports that still need to be made comparable across the country. The Tallinn Charter may provide a common platform to improve and share best practices in performance monitoring. The experience of Italian regions is relevant for the international debate and provides specific responses to general questions that can be usefully applied in other decentralized contexts.}

abstract = {Traditional centralized token exchange (CEX) has been suffering from hacking due to the centralized management of users’ tokens. In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) maintains users’ assets by smart contracts in a decentralized manner, but introduces additional overhead in terms of gas fee and transaction confirmation latency. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the benefits of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is criticized for two issues. First, trading transactions are time-consuming and expensive for frequent token traders. Second, excessive simultaneous transactions might cause the pending transaction congestion in the Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate the pending transaction congestion. Besides, we propose the very first gas-price vs. transaction-confirmation-latency function to guide Ethereum transaction issuers to choose an optimal gas price that minimizes the overall cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the cost in the proposed HEX with that in the conventional HEX. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing gas fees and transaction confirmation latency for frequent traders as well as the pending transaction congestion in Ethereum.}

The decentralized collaborative operation (co-operation) of electric distribution systems and natural gas systems (EDSs&NGSs) considering information privacy preserving can enhance the resilience during an extreme hurricane. To address this issue, this paper proposes a three-level hierarchal solution to decompose the centralized co-operation of the EDS&NGS framework in which an independent decision-making strategy and information privacy preserving for both network operators are simultaneously addressed. Furthermore, in this paper, a min–max robust resilience-constrained co-optimization model is presented to enhance the resilience of the integrated EDS&NGS against worst-case N−kcontingencies and wind power generation uncertainty under extreme hurricane events. To attain the spatial dynamics of extreme hurricanes, a the multi-zone and multi-time extreme hurricanes model is considered. Then, a column-and-constraints generation (C&CG) algorithm is used to solve the proposed robust resilience-constrained co-optimization model. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we conducted experiments on a modified IEEE-33-bus-10-node/123-bus-20-node EDS&NGS. The numerical results show that the proposed robust resilience-constrained co-operation of EDS&NGS problem is an effective model for enhancing EDS resilience.}

A review of research literature on decentralized intelligence in freight transport serves as the foundation of the analysis. The analysis reveals a scarcity of scientific evidence to suggest a successful introduction of decentralized freight intelligence. Among numerous conceptual findings, the analysis reveals a dearth of research on the clear and present challenges of introducing and adopting decentralized freight concepts in contemporary multi organizational open freight systems. For practitioners this paper provides useful input on future ICT development in the transport field. In particular, due to the lack of guidance on adoption of decentralized freight, a focus on non-networked benefits of information technology is to be recommended. Given the large number of projects, papers and various initiatives related to decentralized freight intelligence, this paper, to the authors’ best knowledge, provides a novel technology adoption perspective on decentralized freight intelligence research.}

We show that the solution of the throughput maximization problem depends only on the hard safety constraints imposed on CAVs and its structure enables a decentralized optimal control problem formulation for energy minimization. We present a complete analytical solution of these decentralized problems and derive conditions under which feasible solutions satisfying all safety constraints always exist. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is illustrated through simulation which shows substantial dual benefits of the proposed decentralized framework by allowing CAVs to conserve momentum and fuel while also improving travel time.}

These improvements emphasize the nature of decentralized property rights, linking the outputs of decentralization with its outcomes and the inclusion of contextual factors. Applying MAPAF to analyze outputs and outcomes from two major decentralized forest policies in Ethiopia, i.e., delegation and devolution, has demonstrated the following strengths of the framework. First, by incorporating vital bundles of property rights into APAF, MAPAF creates a common ground for exploring and comparing the extent of democratization achieved by different decentralizing reforms. Second, the inclusion of social and environmental outcomes in MAPAF makes it possible to link the output of decentralization with local level outcomes. Finally, the addition of contextual factors enhances MAPAF's explanatory power by providing room for investigating exogenous factors other than democratization that contribute to the outcomes of decentralization reforms.}

The paper aims to connect these three aspects of smart manufacturing and proposes that through the application of data-driven modeling, CPPS will aid in transforming manufacturing to become more intuitive and automated. In turn, automated manufacturing will pave the way for the decentralization of manufacturing. Layering blockchain technologies on top of CPPS will ensure the reliability and security of data sharing and integration across decentralized systems. Each of these claims is supported by relevant case studies recently published in the literature and from the industry; a brief on existing challenges and the way forward is also provided.}

abstract = {Health sector decentralization has been widely adopted to improve delivery of health services. While many argue that institutional capacities and mechanisms of accountability required to transform decentralized decision-making into improvements in local health systems are lacking, few empirical studies exist which measure or relate together these concepts. Based on research instruments administered to a sample of 91 health sector decision-makers in 17 districts of Pakistan, this study analyzes relationships between three dimensions of decentralization: decentralized authority (referred to as “decision space”), institutional capacities, and accountability to local officials. Composite quantitative indicators of these three dimensions were constructed within four broad health functions (strategic and operational planning, budgeting, human resources management, and service organization/delivery) and on an overall/cross-function basis. Three main findings emerged. First, district-level respondents report varying degrees of each dimension despite being under a single decentralization regime and facing similar rules across provinces. Second, within dimensions of decentralization—particularly decision space and capacities—synergies exist between levels reported by respondents in one function and those reported in other functions (statistically significant coefficients of correlation ranging from ρ=0.22 to ρ=0.43). Third, synergies exist across dimensions of decentralization, particularly in terms of an overall indicator of institutional capacities (significantly correlated with both overall decision space (ρ=0.39) and accountability (ρ=0.23)). This study demonstrates that decentralization is a varied experience—with some district-level officials making greater use of decision space than others and that those who do so also tend to have more capacity to make decisions and are held more accountable to elected local officials for such choices. These findings suggest that Pakistan’s decentralization policy should focus on synergies among dimensions of decentralization to encouraging more use of de jure decision space, work toward more uniform institutional capacity, and encourage greater accountability to local elected officials.}

This paper provides the first empirical evidence on DeFi audit services that check and verify the smart contracts underlying these protocols. Using data on 316 of the largest protocols, we find that those vetted by more smart contract auditors and by higher quality auditors have higher TVL and that these protocols have higher market capitalization (native token values). Using an event study approach, we document that TVL and token values significantly increase after a protocol's first audit, especially those involving a high-quality auditor. We also find that protocols with more auditors and higher audit quality exhibit a smaller drop in TVL and token values after the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which reduced aggregate DeFi TVL by almost 65%. Overall, our findings suggest that DeFi users and investors perceive audits as providing assurance regarding the safety of their deposits and investments.}
