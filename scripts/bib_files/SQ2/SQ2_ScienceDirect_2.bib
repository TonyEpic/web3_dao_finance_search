abstract = {This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the application of 4D flow CMR in MFS through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehensive search of databases from their inception to May 1, 2023. Eligibility criteria were established based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with studies scoring above five deemed high quality. Meta-analyses were performed using Stata 15.1 software. Nine studies were analyzed. Findings indicate MFS patients had increased vortex flow in the descending aorta (DAo), larger aortic root diameter (ARD) and Z-scores, lower inner wall shear stress (WSS) in the proximal descending aorta (pDAo), reduced in-plane rotational flow (IRF) in the aortic arch and proximal descending aorta (pDAo), and increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the ascending aorta (AAo) and DAo compared to healthy subjects. No significant difference in systolic flow reversal ratio was observed. Sensitivity analysis showed no heterogeneity and Egger's test revealed no publication bias. This meta-analysis underscores the effectiveness of 4D flow CMR in detecting MFS, particularly through indicators such as vortex flow, WSS, IRF, ARD, and PWV. The findings provide insights into diagnosing cardiovascular diseases and predicting cardiovascular events in MFS patients. Further case-control studies are needed to establish measurement standards and explore potential indicators for improved diagnosis and treatment of MFS.}

abstract = {Blockchain and other forms of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provide an opportunity to integrate digital information, management, and contracts to increase trust and collaboration within the construction industry. DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.}

abstract = {Despite substantial progress achieved with shrimp production during the last three and a half decades, growth of shrimp export remains minimal in Bangladesh. In the absence of effective traceability and transparency practices, a wide range of malpractice occurs both at the production and post-harvest stages. Traditional paper-based record-keeping methods for the shrimp supply chain are disparate and, therefore, cannot provide efficient traceability capacity and holistic view of the supply chain. These limit the identification of any issues in earlier juncture to proactively ensure food safety, best practice, and good governance. Addressing this multiplexed challenge, we present here ShrimpChain, a public-private hybrid blockchain-based conceptual framework. Focusing on the export market and utilizing existing technologies, the conceptual framework addresses the traceability, transparency, and certification challenges associated with shrimp export. In this framework, from the post-larva purchasing to the final packaging stage, relevant data for every stage will be entered by the associated actors via mobile/web app or Internet of Things devices to the blockchain network. Data authentication will be achieved by a novel approach of incorporating community consensus in conjunction with the machine-derived data entry timestamping method. Instead of the traditional central and endpoint certification approach, we propose a distributed and accumulative score-based certification approach that will grade packaged shrimps according to the completeness and accuracy of the authenticated data entered during different stages. Such distributed approach of certification will enhance not only food safety but also the quality and compliance to best practices. Most importantly, engaging shrimp farmers in the safety and quality assurance as well as to the certification process will empower them to have better control over the market and incentive to produce high-quality shrimp for high-value market.}

Both mediators are potent vasodilators, and they have been shown to reciprocally contribute to the release of each other in the trigeminovascular system, possibly driving migraine development. A high-histamine-content diet triggers migraine in patients who have histamine degradation deficiency owing to diaminooxidase (DAO) gene mutations. Therefore, studying functional links between exogenous histamine and CGRP seems promising for the understanding of diet-induced migraine generation. Notably, there is a lack of knowledge about the interplay of the enteric nervous system and the spinal/trigeminal somatosensory system with regard to CGRP and histamine. Based on background evidence, we propose that a functional interconnection between exogenous histamine and CGRP contributes to migraine development.}

abstract = {Kessler Syndrome is a well-known consequence of high-density constellations in Low Earth Orbits (LEO). The rate of satellites being placed in LEO is increasing drastically, whereas the rate of decay of orbital debris is still the same. The current system that predicts collisions is time consuming and complex. At Earth level, it is difficult to maintain everything by a single system, which makes us move towards decentralized systems. This paper explores a self-organizing decentralized network of ground stations and satellites. The current system for tracking satellites and debris, takes a lot of computing power, and does not provide an accurate result. One of those systems, SOCRATES, predicted a close approach of 584 m, between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 [1]. Those two satellites ended up colliding and creating debris. It is discussed how the new proposed system will aid towards the safety of the space tourism and satellite constellations. A collision could be better sensed locally, instead of being predicted by distant systems. Just like blockchains, any information about new objects will spread from the node that detected it. A few types of nodes will exist in the network based on their task priorities. Possibility of “Consensus” utilization between Alpha nodes in the network, is discussed along with crowd sourcing. The Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are based on blockchain consensus, have a delay of about 30 seconds, which includes sharing and processing of the information by almost the whole network. Unlike this, the satellite network will take much less time, as the information is not to be processed by all nodes and it can use broadcasting features over wireless network. Also, all the nodes in the network will not require the whole blockchain in their memory, which will reduce the complexity of the electronics required on the satellites. Potentially, all the new satellites are supposed to carry this small electronic system which can be part of the network if required. Several uses for adding this block, like giving up its location if the orbital debris removal comes into picture, are also discussed. The network will prioritize the information about the current positions of the orbital debris and satellites but will also share the predicted impacts or close pass-by. This data will improve the statistical analysis for the conjunction assessment by making it more accurate and less complex than the current situation.}

This study has several contributions. It is among the first to investigate blockchain adoption in online advertising, and from a communication perspective. It extends the application of the ICTAM to a whole ecosystem perspective and identifies which factors are essential for successful blockchain adoption in online advertising. The study concludes that while blockchain technology is a promising solution to challenges afflicting online advertising, more education about blockchain’s potential, favourable regulation, and ready-to-use applications are needed before wide-scale adoption can be realised.}

Unfortunately, the crime and security implications of emerging technologies are often overlooked. To anticipate crimes that the metaverse might facilitate, we report the findings of a nominal group technique (NGT) study, which involved a state-of-the-art scoping review of the existing literature and elicitation exercises with two groups of experts (one a diverse group from the UK and Europe, the other representing international law enforcement) with a wide range of expertise. A total of 30 crime threats were identified in the literature or by participants. The elicitation exercises also explored how harmful, frequent, achievable and defeatable participants anticipated that the crimes identified would be. Ratings for these aspects were largely consistent across the two samples, with crimes of a sexual nature (e.g., child sexual abuse material), and crimes against the person (e.g., hate crime) being rated as presenting the highest future risks (i.e. being high harm and high frequency) and being the most difficult to address. The findings illuminate understanding of the most (and least) harmful and likely crime threats the metaverse could facilitate and consequently help stakeholders to prioritise which offences to focus on. In discussing how the crime threats might be addressed, we consider roles and responsibilities and how theory about the management of physical places might inform crime prevention in the metaverse(s).}

This paper develops a taxonomy based on a comprehensive literature analysis to systematically structure this emerging field. The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.}

Open access eliminates the walled-garden approach; instead, it commoditizes communications network capacity while decentralizing access to a transparent wholesale market. It ensures that scarce capacity is put to its best use by providing a platform for efficient trade. The market operates without friction using flow trading. It allows participants to bid persistent piecewise-linear downward-sloping demand curves for portfolios of products, gradually adjusting positions toward targeted needs. Flow trading allows fine granularity of products in time and location, creating complete markets. Liquidity and computational feasibility are maintained despite trading millions of interrelated forward and real-time products. Participants manage risk and adverse price impact through trade-to-target strategies. The market operator clears the market every hour, finding unique prices and quantities that maximize as-bid social welfare. Prices, aggregate quantities, and the slope of the aggregate net demand are public. The market operator observes positions, enabling it to optimize collateral requirements to minimize default risk. Priority pricing is used to manage real-time imbalances. An application of the model is developed for intersatellite wholesale communications with optical (laser-beamed) mesh networks in space, showing several efficiency gains.}

Governance is crucial in achieving the success and sustainability of blockchain systems. However, blockchain governance is multi-faceted, complex, dynamic, and challenging due to its decentralized nature and automatically enforced rules and mechanisms.
Objectives
This study aims to advance the theory of blockchain governance and support practitioners to deepen the researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of blockchain governance.
Methods
The study is a systematic literature review of 75 articles that applies systems theory to conceptualize blockchain governance as a system and parsimoniously organize its interrelated elements into a conceptual model.
Results
The paper proposes a holistic definition and a conceptual model of blockchain governance. Blockchain governance encompasses technical and social means to make decisions on the different levels (e.g., individual, community, organizational, national, international) related to actors, roles, rights, incentives, responsibilities, rules, and the business, technological, legal, and regulatory aspects of a blockchain system during its whole lifecycle.
Conclusion
The system-based model of blockchain governance can serve as a reference framework and structured foundation for analyzing, discussing, and developing the governance of blockchain systems.}

Now, a series of challenges arise in Metaverse security, including massive data traffic breaches, large-scale user tracking, analysis activities, unreliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis results, and social engineering security for people. In this work, we concentrate on Decentraland and Sandbox, two well-known Metaverse applications in Web 3.0. Our experiments analyze, for the first time, the personal privacy data exposed by Metaverse applications and services from a combined perspective of network traffic and privacy policy. We develop a lightweight traffic processing approach suitable for the Web 3.0 environment, which doesn't rely on complex decryption or reverse engineering techniques. We propose a smart contract interaction traffic analysis method capable of retrieving user interactions with Metaverse applications and blockchain smart contracts. This method provides a new approach to de-anonymizing users' identities through Metaverse applications. Our system, METAseen, analyzes and compares network traffic with the privacy policies of Metaverse applications to identify controversial data collection practices. The consistency check experiment reveals that the data types exposed by Metaverse applications include Personal Identifiable Information (PII), device information, and Metaverse-related data. By comparing the data flows observed in the network traffic with assertions made in the privacy regulations of the Metaverse service provider, we discovered that far more than 49% of the Metaverse data flows needed to be disclosed appropriately.}

Here, to investigate the effects of endogenous PAs on the antioxidant system of alfalfa under drought stress and the underlying mechanisms, two alfalfa cultivars, Longzhong (drought resistant) and Gannong No. 3 (drought sensitive), were used as test materials, and their seedlings were treated with polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) for 8 days at −1.2 MPa to simulate drought stress. The levels of free PAs [putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm)], hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), key PA metabolism enzyme [arginine decarboxylase (ADC), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), polyamine oxidase (PAO), and diamine oxidase (DAO)] activities, and antioxidant enzyme [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD)] activities were measured. These physiological indicators were used for correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between PA metabolism and the antioxidant enzyme system. The results showed that PA synthesis in alfalfa under drought stress was dominated by the ADC pathway. Spd and Spm played an important role in improving drought tolerance. The high levels of ADC and SAMDC activities were facilitated by the conversion of Put to Spd and Spm. H2O2 generation by oxidative decomposition of PAs was mainly dependent on the oxidative decomposition of DAO but not PAO. Low DAO activity favored low H2O2 production. Spd, Spm, ADC, ODC and SAMDC were positively correlated with the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and POD in both cultivars under drought. Therefore, we concluded that high ADC and SAMDC activities in alfalfa promoted the conversion of Put to Spd and Spm, leading to high accumulation of Spd and Spm and low Put accumulation. Low Put levels led to low H2O2 production through low DAO activity, and low H2O2 levels induced the expression of antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes to improve antioxidant enzyme activity and reduce MDA accumulation and thereby enhanced drought resistance in alfalfa.}

This is because of the merging of platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp under the “Meta” umbrella, intending to encompass all forms of digital communication and virtual environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this trend, as the need for virtual social interaction has grown due to the cancellation of in-person events. However, creating a metaverse environment parallel to the real world necessitates an examination of its sustainability dimensions, including those from economic, environmental, social, and technological viewpoints. A sustainable metaverse must possess certain characteristics, such as being able to meet high computational demands, being interoperable and scalable, and having appropriate norms and regulations in place. This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of a sustainable metaverse in detail. The Fuzzy Cognitive Map is used to handle negative causal relationships and address the lack of crisp data. Additionally, scenario analysis is conducted to examine the impact of changes in specific characteristics on other characteristics. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the understanding of the metaverse and can serve as a valuable resource for those working to create a sustainable virtual world.}

Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.}

Mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) has promised to integrate multiple service providers to deliver a multimodal mobility service to commuters through a seamless digital platform. An efficient digital network architecture is imperative to achieve secure and reliable interactions among the involved parties. From the service provider’s perspective, by defining the mobility ownership for customers, MaaScan bring a personalized transport system to complement or even fully replace the concept of private vehicle ownership. This paper paves the initial steps to develop a distributed architecture to realize a MaaS digital network using blockchain technology. Therefore, a comprehensive blockchain-enabled MaaS platform with related industries is illustrated in this paper. To do so, first, we define crypto-tickets as means of ownership of the service and devise a straightforward smart contract to be executed in the blockchain network, which allows the customers to exchange the service ownership in a privacy-preserved manner. Then, we evaluate our blockchain-based ownership scheme’s efficacy against the traditional membership plans using a simplified simulation instance in MATLAB. Finally, we discuss the blockchain potentials in personalizing the ownership of the service, congestion management, and data trading between various stakeholder of a comprehensive MaaS platform.}

The mechanism of inter-firm cooperation is increasingly being altered by radical developments in blockchains and artificial intelligence among other technologies. To capture and address this shift, this review takes a problematisation approach and focuses wholly on the pertinence of agency theory. First, it begins by acknowledging the established corpus in the area before, second, appraising the seven long-held assumptions in the principal-agent relationship encompassing (1) self-interest, (2) conflicting goals, (3) bounded rationality, (4) information asymmetry, (5) pre-eminence of efficiency, (6) risk aversion and (7) information as a commodity. Third, to add a fresh perspective, the review proceeds to proffer seven assumptions to advance a novel ‘Blockchain Agency Theory’ that would better describe new attributes and relaxed agency behaviour in blockchain alliances. These counter assumptions are (1) common interests, (2) congruent goals, (3) unbounded rationality, (4) information symmetry, (5) smart contracts, (6) mean risk and (7) information availability. In the fourth part, the prior audience of principals and agents is appraised and this culminates into, fifth, a consideration of a new audience of blockchain agency in algocratic environments. Altogether, the seven new assumptions extend and provoke new agency thinking among scholars and blockchain practitioners alike.}

The performance of these AI systems increases exponentially, which requires exponentially increasing resources as well, including data, computational power, and energy. This development is not sustainable and there is a need for new AI approaches, which give careful consideration to limited resources. In this chapter, we discuss how new AI could benefit from lessons learnt from human brains, human intelligence, and human constraints. We describe various aspects of biological and artificial intelligence. We introduce a balanced approach based on the concepts of complementarity and multistability as manifested in human brain operation and cognitive processing.

Thus, in contrast to earlier iterations of the web, Web3 users are asked to trust the technology itself rather than the human intermediaries. On its face, this shift to a trustless web calls into question the traditional conceptions of and requirements for trust. However, in this article, we caution against claims that advocate distrusting Web3 on the basis that, despite how quickly Web3 technology is advancing, the psychological processes through which people perceive and make sense of the social world remain fundamentally unchanged. Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research. Overall, this article provides critical guidance to brand managers, policy advisors, and academics seeking to understand, build, and trust Web3 technology.}

We have characterized two novel mutations R38H and Q201R found in ALS patients and report certain novel findings related to the R199W mutation. We report the first instance of crystal structure analysis of a patient-derived mutant of DAO, R38H, solved at 2.10 Å. The structure revealed significant perturbations and altered binding with the cofactor (FAD) and the inhibitor benzoate, supported by biochemical assays. Q201R-DAO also exhibited significantly lower ligand binding efficiency. Furthermore, kinetic analysis across all variants revealed reduced oxidase activity and substrate binding. Notably, R38H-DAO exhibited near-WT activity only at high substrate concentrations, while R199W-DAO and Q201R-DAO displayed drastic activity reduction. Additionally, structural perturbations were inferred for R199W-DAO and Q201R-DAO, evident by the higher oligomeric state in the holoenzyme form. We also observed thermal instability in case of R199W-DAO mutant. We hypothesize that the mutant enzymes may be rendered non-functional in a cellular context, potentially leading to NMDAR-associated excitotoxicity.

In juxtaposition, wallet software can also be issued without the involvement of a liable third-party. As no KYC is performed and users have full ‘freedom to act’, such ‘non-custodial’ wallet software is popular in criminal undertakings. They are required to interact with peer-to-peer applications and organisations running on blockchains whose benefits are not the subject of this paper. To date, financial regulation fails to adequately address such wallet software because it presumes the existence of a registered, liable entity offering said software. As illustrated in the case of Tornado Cash, financial regulation fails to trace chains of secondary liability. Alas, the considered solution is a systematic surveillance of all transactions. Against this backdrop, this paper sets forth an alternative approach rooted in copyright law. Concepts that pertain to secondary liability prove of value to develop a flexible, principles-based approach to the regulation of non-custodial wallet software that accounts for both, infringing and non-infringing uses.}

Accumulation of endogenous polyamines and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the peel and the pulp of ‘Langra’ fruit treated with melatonin was a possible reason for its chilling tolerance. Accumulation of endogenous polyamines was associated with higher arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), and lower diamine oxidase (DAO) and polyamine oxidase (PAO) activities in the peel and pulp. Additionally, higher GABA shunt (Glutamate decarboxylase and GABA-transaminase) activity was associated with elevated GABA content in ‘Langra’ mangoes. The limited effectiveness of melatonin treatment for chilling injury alleviation in ‘Chaunsa’ was probably due to higher polyamines accumulation accompanied with lower PAO and DAO activity in the peel and pulp of the fruit, in addition to higher ADC and ODC in the peel.}

For supporting this hypothesis, striking analogies between the concepts underlying blockchain technology with research are identified, and applied to the generation of verified knowledge in science and technology development. It is then elaborated how a blockchain-enabled token economy can efficiently and transparently incentivize and coordinate an integrative and community-inclusive participatory approach to fuel crowdsourcing of collective intelligence for contributing ideas, work, infrastructure, funding, data, validation, management, assessment, governance, arbitration and exploitation of projects. Quality, credibility and direction of projects are optimized by demanding collateral “skin-in-the-game” from contributors based on blockchain-enabled staking, reputation systems and prediction markets. This way research progress emerges as a chain of community generated and independently vetted blocks of scientific knowledge; these new blocks are concatenated with the state-of-the-art according to transparent consensus mechanisms.}

Their application is rapidly expanding in the financial sector, public sector, supply chain management, and the automobile, real estate, insurance, and health care industries. With the growing use of smart contracts and an increasing variety of smart contracts applications, the debate over the legal implications of this phenomenon has intensified and many legal issues related to smart contracts are being examined. Legal scholars have highlighted potential legal pitfalls, controversies and incompatibilities with existing legal frameworks. Blockchain technology and smart contracts have also been fuelling an interest of legislators, who have begun to recognise regulatory uncertainties and are making the first attempts to introduce legislative solutions to address them. This paper aims to highlight the fervour of the scholarly debate surrounding smart contracts and contrast it with a rather modest response from the legislators thus far. The paper reiterates that smart contracts represent the future. Even though they challenge practitioners, scholars, and legislators, current legislative initiatives indicate that under most legal systems there are no major obstacles for smart contracts and to accommodate smart contracts within the existing legal frameworks we should expect legal evolution rather than revolution.}

We then conclude with guidelines for other organizations looking to implement similar blockchain governance solutions while maintaining integrity in their operations.}

Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article reviews blockchain’s computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain.}

We start by describing three public cases when the above happened. For each case, we elaborate on the adopted solution, which we refer to as the “rollback,” the “do nothing,” and the “overturn” solution. Drawing from these previous cases, discussions with experts, and from our own experience with blockchain research and development, we provide suggestions concerning managerial, technical, and information security policies and practices organizations should follow when contemplating enterprise-level applications of the blockchain technology.}

Subsequently, Blockchains evolved from decentralized cryptocurrency ledgers to platforms for developing decentralized applications. A decentralized application needs a variety of data from the real world that cannot be directly provided by smart contracts. Oracles provide a mechanism to input data to the smart contracts for decentralized applications in a trusted manner. Oracles are the entities that collect data from data sources, verify it and then transmit it to the Blockchain. The introduction of Oracles has brought back the issues of centralization, single point of failure and reliance on a trusted third party in the Blockchain ecosystem. Oracles have adopted different means to reduce centralization and achieve some trustless operating mechanisms involving decentralized algorithms based on voting or reputation. In this paper, we analyse the concept of the Blockchain Oracle problem, its effects on various Blockchain applications, various Oracle types and trust mechanisms. We also analyse some of the significant Oracles (like chainlink, provable), and their underlying mechanisms and compare them. In the end, we carry out a gap analysis and discuss some open research issues that must be addressed to achieve robust and secure decentralization.}

Many degrowth scholars wholly reject technical fixes for politically induced environmental crises, seeing blockchain projects as wasteful and counter to convivial social relations. Others highlight the technology's potential for facilitating redistributive and regenerative economies, but without much detail. This paper argues that if blockchain is ever to prove useful for the degrowth movement it would need to overcome challenges in three important areas: 1) building democratic and (re)distributive economies, 2) regenerating the environment without commodifying it, and 3) facilitating international alliances without imposing a particular set of values. What is certain is that technology on its own will not transcend the political struggles tackled by degrowth activists. However, under certain conditions, blockchain might make those struggles more effective.}

However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platform’s potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.}

In this paper, we present a PoS simulator written in the Julia language that allows one to test several variants of PoS-based consensus algorithms, tweaking their parameters, and observe how the distribution of cryptocurrency coins among the users evolves over time. Such a tool can be used to investigate which combinations of parameters values allow to obtain a “fair” and stable consensus algorithm, in which, over the long term, no one gets richer or poorer by the mere act of validating blocks. Based on this investigation, we also introduce a new PoS-based consensus mechanism that allows the system to keep the wealth distribution stable even after a large number of epochs.}

However, the need for high-level quantum programming abstractions and targeted use cases paired with vertical applications, which can directly benefit from quantum computing, remains an open challenge. This paper presents our vision for a decentralized architecture for swarm based IoT systems that leverages a high-level continuous development and integration quantum programming suite to support edge processing capabilities for different use cases across the edge-fog-cloud continuum. The planned Quantum DevKit provides the necessary abstractions and low-level backend interfaces for quantum computing infrastructure, enabling edge computation using quantum processing, with extensions to efficient management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The paper focuses on the presentation of the development kit and its coupling swarm-based architecture that automates the orchestration of the cloud-to-edge continuum, showcasing the potential of quantum technology in edge processing.}

abstract = {The climate of the South China Sea (SCS) is dominated by the East Asian monsoon (EAM) and can be related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) owing to the interaction between ENSO and the EAM. An annually-banded coral (Porites sp.) collected from Con Dao Island in the southern SCS was measured for Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios at near-monthly resolution through the annual bands of AD 1948–1999. This island is only ~90 km from the Mekong Delta coast and thus significantly influenced by riverine discharge, suggesting relatively severe environmental stress on corals. The Sr/Ca time series shows a clear annual cyclicity chiefly modulated by sea-surface temperature (SST), whereas the Mg/Ca time series exhibits an indistinct annual cyclicity, indicating that the previously-proposed coral Mg/Ca thermometry is greatly disturbed. An instrumental SST record in Con Dao Island (since 1980) has been compared with the Sr/Ca time series to calibrate a Sr/Ca thermometer. The Sr/Ca vs. SST comparison shows that the Sr/Ca thermometer is sometimes disturbed by some factor and that almost all of the disturbances occur around the annual-maximum SST in the warm/wet season. The Sr/Ca data around the annual-minimum SST in the cool/dry season is almost free from the disturbance and thus useful as a SST proxy. The disturbances of the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca thermometers may be ascribed to the Mekong River discharge and its accompanying phenomena (i.e., large freshwater input, suspended-sediment loads, intense phytoplankton blooms, etc.), which are likely to disturb coral physiological processes. Applying the Sr/Ca thermometer to the whole Sr/Ca time series provides a SST reconstruction from 1948 through 1999. Reconstructed annual-minimum SSTs show a clear quasi-biennial oscillation significantly correlated with ENSO, indicating that the annual-minimum SST in the southern SCS tends to be higher (lower) in El Niño (La Niña) phases. This is compatible with previous observations that the East Asian winter monsoon is weakened (strengthened) in El Niño (La Niña) phases. The reconstructed SST record suggests a warming of 1.0 °C for the latter half of the 20th century. The Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca time series exhibit similar decadal-to-bidecadal variations, which do not seem to be primarily due to SST variability but rather due to some other factor possibly related to disturbance or fluctuation of coral physiological processes. Although both of our Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca data are affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by some non-temperature factor, a part of the Sr/Ca data provides a useful SST proxy and suggests that coral-based SST reconstruction in the southern SCS may be an effective means for monitoring the EAM and ENSO.}

After the advancement of electromechanical technologies, today's modern vehicles have been developed. Those who used these vehicles thought of transferring control from the human to autonomous driving systems to solve their safety and comfort problems. Today, instead of fully autonomous systems targeted for the future, autonomous driving support systems have been developed. Although these systems aim to increase the safety and comfort of passengers, they can become an easy target for malicious people due to network technologies and remote connection features. The most effective method of protection from these attackers is to conduct vulnerability analysis against newly emerging threats for the systems we use and to rectify identified vulnerabilities. In this research paper, the weaknesses of wireless communication towards remote connection usage of the mini electric autonomous vehicle were investigated, which we developed and produced its mechanics, electronics, and software. In this context, a test environment was created, and the problems and threats in autonomous driving technology were revealed through attacks (Deauth Attack, DoS, DDoS and MitM) made on the test environment. Following the exposed vulnerabilities, studies were conducted for the detection of these attacks using Artificial Intelligence. In the study, different algorithms were used to detect the attacks, and random forest algorithm successfully detected 96.1% of attacks.

Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms. To effectively leverage decentralized trust as a novel aspect of competitive actions, business leaders must pursue Web3 technologies that are reliable, high-growth market segments that are credible, and ventures that are investable.}

Building on studies on the embeddedness of urban digital platforms with a local character, this article studies how the app under consideration is shaped by, and adapted to, the needs and resources of local socio-economic contexts. Two pilot experimentations on the app are considered, concerning systems for rewarding civic participation and urban sharing economies. The empirical analysis concerns the methodology for introducing the app into local socio-economic contexts, the way in which local actors interpret its properties, and the resulting iterative co-design of its functionalities. The article defines and discusses the extent to which the civic blockchain is rendered context-based by this methodology, and highlights similarities and differences with other urban digital platforms. The empirical evidence drawn from this research contributes to the debate on how community members, researchers and digital experts together can realise alternative forms of urban digitalization.}

The cultivation yielded 2343 ± 98 nkat/Lculture with a specific DAO activity of 1301 ± 54.2 nkat/gprotein, which was a 93-fold increase of specific DAO activity compared to the native Y. lipolytica PO1f DAO-1 production. The DAO-1 showed a broad substrate selectivity with tyramine, histamine, putrescine and cadaverine being the most favored substrates. It was most active at 40 °C, pH 7.2 in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM) (with histamine as substrate), which is comparable to human and porcine DAOs. The affinity of DAO-1 towards histamine was lower compared to mammalian DAOs (Km = 2.3 ± 0.2 mM). Nevertheless, DAO-1 degraded around 75% of the histamine used in a bioconversion experiment with a food-relevant concentration of 150 mg/L. With its broad selectivity for the most relevant biogenic amines in foods, DAO-1 from Y. lipolytica PO1f is an interesting enzyme for application in the food industry for the degradation of biogenic amines.}

abstract = {Background
D-serine and the D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) enzyme, which breaks down d-amino acids, may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia by affecting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The exact role of D-serine and DAO, as well as the consequences of increased DAO activity in patients with schizophrenia, remain unclear. We aimed to investigate D-serine and DAO levels in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders before treatment and after six months of treatment.
Method
Comparisons for the serum levels of D-serine and DAO were made between 81 healthy controls and 89 patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders without a history of treatment. Further comparisons were made after 6 months for changes in these levels in the 41 patients in follow-up. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS), Calgary Scale for Depression in Schizophrenia (CDSS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), Global Assessment Scale (GAS), and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were used to evaluate the symptom severity and functionality. Secondary results included comparisons related to antipsychotic equivalent doses.
Results
Before treatment, patients had significantly lower levels of D-serine, DAO, and D-serine/DAO ratio compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.001; p < 0.001; p = 0.004). DAO and D-serine levels of the patients were higher after six months of treatment (p = 0.025; p = 0.001). There was correlation of DAO levels with antipsychotic dosage and with PANSS negative and total subscale scores (rho = 0.421, p = 0.01; rho = 0.280, p = 0.008; rho = 0.371, p = 0.000). No correlation was found between serum D-serine level, DAO level, and the D-serine/DAO ratio with cognitive function.
Conclusions
The results suggest that D-serine and DAO may play a role that is sensitive to treatment effects in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact antipsychotic drugs have on NMDA receptor dysfunction, there is a requirement for studies that directly evaluates the activity of the DAO enzyme.}

Unlike existing state-of-the-art, this system can be deployed in a fully decentralized manner, meaning it does not rely on any single actor to function correctly. Using a Smart Contract-driven workflow coupled with a commitment scheme and a differential privacy-based solution, we ensure training integrity, prevent plagiarism, and protect against leakage of sensitive data while performing effective federated training. We demonstrate the system’s effectiveness by performing simulation and implementation of an end-to-end proof of concept. Our practical implementation showcases the system’s efficiency on a single computer with multiple trainers, revealing low memory demands and manageable network and block I/O, which suggest scalability to larger, more complex networks. The paper concludes by exploring future enhancements, including advanced cryptographic methods for enhanced privacy and potential applications extending the system’s utility to broader domains within FL. Our work lays the groundwork for a new generation of decentralized learning systems, promising increased adoption in real-world scenarios where data privacy and security are of paramount concern.}

Findings from comprehensive literature reviews and specific case studies, including “HydroChain” and “H2-Share,” are synthesized to evaluate blockchain's ability to improve transparency, efficiency, and compliance within hydrogen production, storage, and distribution systems. The results indicate that blockchain technology could significantly enhance hydrogen traceability and certification, facilitate robust peer-to-peer energy trading platforms, and strengthen market dynamics through improved logistical operations. However, notable challenges such as scalability, interoperability among diverse blockchain systems, and the need for adaptive regulatory frameworks are identified as major barriers to its full adoption. Addressing these challenges will require a multidisciplinary approach and proactive collaboration among stakeholders to develop scalable blockchain solutions that can effectively integrate with existing technologies.

abstract = {Since the last few years there has been a massive spurt of Research on Blockchain Technologies and several attempts at incorporating them for a myriad of Business Applications. Blockchain Technologies promised to bring about decentralized trust having the potential to disrupt digital ecosystems by providing alternatives to centralized storage and management of data. This has the potential to radically transform industries and services through new models of data storage, transparency, tracking, payment systems amongst other advantages. However, Blockchain Technology is designed to provide other Value Propositions beyond decentralized storage, such as innovative crypto economic and investment models and radical new forms of decentralized participative governance models that could lead to the evolution of new generation of Digital Platforms and multi stakeholder business interactions. In this paper, through a systematic literature review, we present a set of key Blockchain Value Propositions and a discussion on how it can complement to the evolution of Digital Platforms and the Collaborative Economy. We also argue that while some of the value propositions are easier to integrate with existing Digital Platforms, more disruptive value propositions such as Business Automation, Economic and Governance Models present greater challenges but could lead to not just innovation at the technological level, but also metamorphosis of the existing social, economic and governance models.}

These are places where non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) are bought and sold—as avatars, “land” and places to go on the land, artwork, and other digital objects. This economy straddles both the physical and digital worlds—the items within it are bought and sold via digital currencies that can be exchanged for other digital currencies recognized in the physical world. Decentralized worlds are both places for users to “own” what they have in the environment in a new and more complete way and act as exchanges for the buying and selling of unique digital goods. While the user may “own” a digital object (unlike the environments explored in Chapter 6), there are still codes of conduct and the administrator of the environment retains an ability to terminate access. This termination takes on additional meaning in light of the economic structure.}

abstract = {Integrating blockchain into the Internet of Things (IoT) for security is a new development in computational communication systems. While security threats are changing their strategies and constructing new threats on blockchain-based IoT systems. Also, in combining blockchain with IoT networks, malicious transactions and active attacks deliver more vulnerabilities, privacy issues, and security threats. The concept of blockchain-based IoT attacks is a hot topic in both IoT and blockchain disciplines. Network attacks are a type of security and privacy threat and cover the exact scope of threats related to the combination of IoT and blockchain. Even though blockchain has potential security benefits, new cyberattacks have emerged that make blockchain alone insufficient to deal with threats and attacks in IoT networks since vagueness and ambiguity issues are unavoidable in IoT data. The heterogeneous nature of IoT sources has made uncertainty a critical issue in IoT networks. Deep Learning (DL) models have difficulty dealing with uncertainty issues and cannot manage them efficiently as an essential tool in security techniques. Thus, we need better security, privacy, and practical approaches, such as efficient threat detection against network attacks in blockchain-based IoT environments. Also helpful to consider fuzzy logic to tackle deterministic issues when DL models face uncertainty. This paper designs and implements a secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework. This framework utilizes a novel fuzzy DL model, optimized adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)-based attack detection, fuzzy matching (FM), and fuzzy control system (FCS) for detection of network attacks. The proposed fuzzy DL applies the fuzzy Choquet integral to have a powerful nonlinear aggregation function in the detection. We use metaheuristic algorithms to optimize the attack detection error function in ANFIS. We also validate transactions via FM to tackle fraud detection and efficiency in the blockchain layer. This framework is the first secure, intelligent fuzzy blockchain framework that identifies and detects security threats while considering uncertainty issues in IoT networks and having more flexibility in decision-making and accepting transactions in the blockchain layer. Evaluation results verify the efficiency of the blockchain layer in throughput and latency metrics and the intelligent fuzzy layer in performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score) in threat detection on both blockchain and IoT network sides. Additionally, FCS demonstrates that we obtain an effective system (stable model) for threat detection in blockchain-based IoT networks.}

abstract = {Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a ‘block’, the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.}

At the same time, scientists and developers are searching for innovative methods to better understand how the fundamental shifts caused by digital change will affect the future of humanity over the coming decades. Interdisciplinary governance research at the intersection of technological and environmental foresight is urgently needed to minimize the risks of technological change and explore how digitalization may support, hinder or re-shape sustainability transformations. In this article, we focus on the case of ‘blockchain’ or distributed-ledger technology (DLT) to investigate how recent digital technologies may support the implementation of sustainable development initiatives. Our investigation is centered on areas of public administration and governance which will most likely see an adoption of DLT over the next two decades, such as digital identity, social service provision, and innovative climate finance. To allow for a meaningful comparison of various use cases, we propose four guiding questions that can help researchers, decision-makers and practitioners to determine whether DLT might be an appropriate choice for the sustainability-related task at hand. Moreover, we illustrate how the initial design and subsequent implementation of DLTs may support more centralized or networked modes of governance.}

Societies 5.0 is committed to optimizing the use of natural, artificial, and social resources by enhancing democratic participation and ensuring that decision-making processes are more transparent, reliable, and aligned with the needs of the populace in sustainable ways. Moreover, our discussion extends to how Society 5.0’s principles correlate with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), providing a framework that supports health, education, and poverty reduction, among other targets. This approach also aligns with the Human Development Index (HDI), reinforcing the notion that technological progress in Society 5.0 does not overshadow but rather complements and enhances human values, paving a synergistic path towards sustainable development that is both advanced and fundamentally human-centric.}

Investor attention, sentiment, heuristics and biases, and network effects interact to form a highly volatile and dynamic market.

abstract = {The aim of this systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how ontologies address current Smart Contract challenges, identify application scenarios, and present tools and technologies associated with their use. This systematic literature review (SLR), following Kitchenham's methodology, analyses peer-reviewed articles from 2015 to August 2022 from databases such as Scopus, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer Link and ACM. Of the 501 publications identified, 21 are selected for in-depth review based on inclusion, exclusion and quality assessment criteria. The results of this SLR show that ontologies provide solutions to the challenges faced by Smart Contracts mainly at the creation stage. They allow the terms of the contract and the roles of the parties to be defined. Ontologies also enable the development of Smart Contract templates. This facilitates their use by people without technical programming expertise. Despite these potential solutions to the challenges that Smart Contracts face throughout their lifecycle, they lack verification. This increases the vulnerabilities to which Smart Contracts are exposed. Developing validation and verification tools could facilitate using ontologies to create Smart Contracts for different real-world cases.}

keywords = {Cybercrime, Cyberattacks, Cryptocurrencies, Stock market, Gold},
abstract = {We investigate the impact of cryptocurrency-related cyberattacks on the cryptocurrency market and traditional financial markets. The dataset consists of historical cyberattack data and trading data for twenty cryptocurrencies, three cryptocurrency uncertainty indices, five payment companies, four stock indices, a commodity index, and gold. We find that cyberattacks are associated with negative returns, increased volatility, and increased trading volume not only for the cryptocurrencies but also for the payment companies, the financial and technology sectors, and the general stock market. However, the impact of cyberattacks on cryptocurrencies has been decreasing over time, while the impact on payment companies and the financial sector has been increasing. Moreover, gold prices have shown a positive response to these cyberattacks. These results underscore the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures in the fintech sector and may inform both policymakers and market participants.}
