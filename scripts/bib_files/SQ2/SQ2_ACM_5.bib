abstract = {During a disaster, emergency response operations can benefit from the establishment of a wireless ad hoc network. We propose the use of autonomous robots that move inside a disaster area and establish a network for two-way communication between trapped civilians with uncertain locations and an operation centre. Our aim is to maximise the number of civilians connected to the network. We present a distributed algorithm which involves clustering possible locations of civilians according to their expected shortfall; clustering facilitates both connectivity within groups of civilians and exploration that is based on the uncertainty of these locations. To achieve efficient allocation in terms of time and energy, we also develop a modified algorithm according to which the robots consider the graph that the cluster centres form and follow its minimum spanning tree. We conduct simulations and discuss the efficiency and appropriateness of the two algorithms in different situations.},

Mobile manipulators (MMs) have been suggested for various applications such as tasks involving hazardous environments, explosive handling, waste management, outdoor exploration and space operations. This paper describes a novel control algorithm for human-MM cooperation executing tasks in rough outdoor terrains. The proposed approach uses inexpensive common MM sensors such as wrist force/torque, IMU and joint/wheel encoders to achieve minimal human effort. The paper describes a control mechanism that enables ground mobile manipulators to execute complex tasks in cooperation with humans or other autonomous robots when working in unknown, dynamic heterogeneous outdoor rough terrains/environments. Simulation tests using a detailed SIMMECHANICS/ SIMULINK model of the employed MM are presented to illustrate and show the performance of the developed mechanisms.},

abstract = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are introduced to improve individuals’ quality of life by offering a wide range of services. They collect a huge amount of data and exchange them with each other and the infrastructure. The collected data usually includes sensitive information about the users and the surrounding environment. Therefore, data security and privacy are among the main challenges in this industry. Blockchain, an emerging distributed ledger, has been considered by the research community as a potential solution for enhancing data security, integrity, and transparency in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, despite the emphasis of governments on the transparency of personal data protection practices, CAV stakeholders have not been successful in communicating appropriate information with the end users regarding the procedure of collecting, storing, and processing their personal data, as well as the data ownership. This article provides a vision of the opportunities and challenges of adopting blockchain in ITS from the “data transparency” and “privacy” perspective. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1)&nbsp;Considering the amount of personal data collected by the CAVs, such as location, how would the integration of blockchain technology affect transparency, fairness, and lawfulness of personal data processing concerning the data subjects (as this is one of the main principles in the existing data protection regulations)? (2)&nbsp;How can the trade-off between transparency and privacy be addressed in blockchain-based ITS use cases?},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly becoming part of the emerging Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and they are positioned to advance smart mobility. To enable this, new on-board sensors collect and transmit growing types and quantities of data. This raises new and unique privacy considerations around what happens with this data. As the automotive industry becomes more data-driven, getting consumer privacy rights will become increasingly important for establishing trust and customer acceptance of this technology. At the same time, the algorithmic decision making in AVs raises several new ethical issues that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. In this paper we analyze what are the new privacy and data protection challenges that emerge in AVs and investigate the ethical and liability concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making, highlighting research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues by acting swiftly.},

abstract = {The proliferation of semiconductor-based nonlinear devices in power systems has caused serious concern over power quality issue. This paper proposes a decentralized control strategy for multiple active front-ends (AFEs) so that harmonic currents as well as reactive power generated by the nonlinear load can be compensated. Under the proposed control strategy, each active front-end autonomously decides its share in power quality improvement task, which is bounded by converter power rating and dynamically adjusted by the machine loading condition. The harmonic currents and reactive power uncompensated by an active front-end will be left for other units on its source side to compensate. In this way, the overall power quality improvement task can be automatically distributed to multiple active front-ends without communications. In order to verify the proposed control strategy, theoretical analysis is fully carried out and detailed simulation studies using switching-level converter models are performed.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of this decade, several incidents report that false data injection attacks targeting intelligent connected vehicles cause huge industrial damage and loss of lives. Data Theft, Flooding, Fuzzing, Hijacking, Malware Spoofing and Advanced Persistent Threats have been immensely growing attack that leads to end-user conflict by abolishing trust on autonomous vehicle. Looking after those sensitive data that contributes to measure the localisation factors of the vehicle, conventional centralised techniques can be misused to update the legitimate vehicular status maliciously. As investigated, the existing centralized false data detection approach based on state and likelihood estimation has a reprehensible trade-off in terms of accuracy, trust, cost, and efficiency. Blockchain with Fuzzy-logic Intelligence has shown its potential to solve localisation issues, trust and false data detection challenges encountered by today’s autonomous vehicular system. The proposed Blockchain-based fuzzy solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and reputation preservation technique. The illustrated proposed model filters false and anomalous data based on the vehicles’ rules and behaviours. Besides improving the detection accuracy and eliminating the single point of failure, the contributions include appropriating fuzzy AI functions within the Road-side Unit node before authorizing status data by a Blockchain network. Finally, thorough experimental evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract = {In the context of coordination and planning in collaborative multi-robot/agent systems, we consider a general reference problem that includes tasks that are spatially localized and have an associated service time, and accounts for the use of a heterogeneous team, in which different robots may have a different performance on the same task. A mixed integer linear formulation is introduced and used to solve the problem model in a centralized iterative manner: in closed-loop, team-level plans are adaptively computed and sent out. Unfortunately, a centralized scheme can suffer from computational and communication shortcomings. Therefore, we introduce a top-down recipe for decentralization, aiming to balance the tradeoff among implementation costs, computational requirements, and quality of coordination. The decentralized architecture depends on various aspects that we study through an empirical sensitivity analysis. Results show that the impact and the relationships among the different aspects are far from being obvious or intuitive. A number of practical lessons are learned, that could apply to other similar problems and/or decentralized architectures derived in the same top-down modality.},

abstract = {DevOps unifies software development and operations in cross-functional teams to improve software delivery and operations (SDO) performance. Ideally, cross-functional DevOps teams independently deploy their services, but the correct operation of a service often demands other services, requiring coordination to ensure the correct deployment order. This issue is currently solved either with a central deployment or manual out-of-band communication across teams, e.g., via phone, chat, or email. Unfortunately, both contradict the independence of teams, hindering SDO performance—the reason why DevOps is adopted in the first place. In this work, we conduct a study on 73 IT professionals, showing that, in practice, they resort to manual coordination for correct deployments even if they expect better SDO performance with fully automated approaches. To address this issue, we propose µs ([mju:z] “muse”), a novel IaC system automating deployment coordination in a fully decentralized fashion, still retaining compatibility with DevOps practice—in contrast to today’s solutions. We implement µs, demonstrate that it effectively enables automated coordination, introduces negligible definition overhead, has no performance overhead, and is broadly applicable, as shown by the migration of 64 third-party IaC projects.},

In this paper, we build upon an industry-strength, blockchain-based, Know Your Customer data sharing platform to facilitate a novel data marketplace by detailing a method of pricing data such that banks save money and are suitably incentivised to trade their data. The pricing model we detail enables banks to reduce the cost of document acquisition and verification by at least 45\%, and even profit by providing documents.

abstract = {Many different types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been developed to address a variety of applications ranging from searching and mapping to surveillance. However, for complex wide-area surveillance scenarios, where fleets of autonomous UAVs must be deployed to work collectively on a common goal, multiple types of UAVs should be incorporated forming a heterogeneous UAV system. Indeed, the interconnection of two levels of UAVs---one with high altitude fixed-wing UAVs and one with low altitude rotary-wing UAVs---can provide applicability for scenarios which cannot be addressed by either UAV type. This work considers a bi-level flying ad hoc networks (FANETs), in which each UAV is equipped with ad hoc communication capabilities, in which the higher level fixed-wing swarm serves mainly as a communication bridge for the lower level UAV fleets, which conduct precise information sensing. The interconnection of multiple UAV types poses a significant challenge, since each UAV level moves according to its own mobility pattern, which is constrained by the UAV physical properties. Another important challenge is to form network clusters at the lower level, whereby the intra-level links must provide a certain degree of stability to allow a reliable communication within the UAV system. This article proposes a novel mobility model for the low-level UAVs that combines a pheromone-based model with a multi-hop clustering algorithm. The pheromones permit to focus on the least explored areas with the goal to optimize the coverage while the multi-hop clustering algorithm aims at keeping a stable and connected network. The proposed model works online and is fully distributed. The connection stability is evaluated against different measurements such as stability coefficient and volatility. The performance of the proposed model is compared to other state-of-the-art contributions using simulations. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed mobility model to significantly improve the network stability while having a limited impact on the wide-area coverage.},

abstract = {Although a remarkably high degree of automation has been reached in production and intra-logistics nowadays, human labor is still used for transportation using handcarts and forklifts. High labor cost and risk of injury are the undesirable consequences. Alternative approaches in automated warehouses are fixed installed conveyors installed either overhead or floor-based. The drawback of such solutions is the lack of flexibility, which is necessary when the production lines of the company change. Then, such an installation has to be re-built.In this paper, we propose a novel approach of decentralized teams of autonomous robots performing intra-logistics tasks using distributed algorithms. Centralized solutions suffer from limited scalability and have a single point of failure. The task is to transport material between stations keeping the communication network structure intact and most importantly, to facilitate a fair distribution of robots among loading stations. Our approach is motivated by strategies from peer-to-peer-networks and mobile ad-hoc networks. In particular we use an adapted version of distributed heterogeneous hash tables (DHHT) for distributing the tasks and localized communication. Experimental results presented in this paper show that our method reaches a fair distribution of robots over loading stations.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.},

abstract = {Memory-bounded techniques have shown great promise in solving complex multi-agent planning problems modeled as DEC-POMDPs. Much of the performance gains can be attributed to pruning techniques that alleviate the complexity of the exhaustive backup step of the original MBDP algorithm. Despite these improvements, state-of-the-art algorithms can still handle a relative small pool of candidate policies, which limits the quality of the solution in some benchmark problems. We present a new algorithm, Point-Based Policy Generation, which avoids altogether searching the entire joint policy space. The key observation is that the best joint policy for each reachable belief state can be constructed directly, instead of producing first a large set of candidates. We also provide an efficient approximate implementation of this operation. The experimental results show that our solution technique improves the performance significantly in terms of both runtime and solution quality.},

To overcome this challenge, many Decentralised Web (DW) implementations rely on federation policies. Administrators use these policies to create rules that ban or modify content that matches specific rules. This, however, can have unintended consequences for many users. In this paper, we present the first study of federation policies on the DW, their in-the-wild usage, and their impact on users. We identify how these policies may negatively impact "innocent" users and outline possible solutions to avoid this problem in the future.},

abstract = {Self-optimization is the process in which a software system autonomously and continuously adapts itself based on environmental changes which negatively impact its overall performance. Most self-optimizing systems rely on an abstract model, with the majority relying on an abstract model representing the running software architecture to guide self-optimization decisions. However, existing approaches to self-optimization are centralized resulting in a single point of failure. This paper outlines a decentralized approach to self-optimization based on DARE, an architecture-based framework for providing component-based software systems with self-configuration, self-healing, and self-protection properties. We show how DARE services are extended to monitor and analyze the incoming message rate of components as well as how these services coordinate at runtime to self-optimize the controlled software system without losing any transactions. Experimental results demonstrate DARE's ability to achieve self-optimization at runtime and in a decentralized way.},

abstract = {Decentralized Markov Decision Processes (DEC-MDPs) are a popular model of agent-coordination problems in domains with uncertainty and time constraints but very difficult to solve. In this paper, we improve a state-of-the-art heuristic solution method for DEC-MDPs, called OC-DEC-MDP, that has recently been shown to scale up to larger DEC-MDPs. Our heuristic solution method, called Value Function Propagation (VFP), combines two orthogonal improvements of OC-DEC-MDP. First, it speeds up OC-DEC-MDP by an order of magnitude by maintaining and manipulating a value function for each state (as a function of time) rather than a separate value for each pair of sate and time interval. Furthermore, it achieves better solution qualities than OC-DEC-MDP because, as our analytical results show, it does not overestimate the expected total reward like OC-DEC- MDP. We test both improvements independently in a crisis-management domain as well as for other types of domains. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant speedup of VFP over OC-DEC-MDP as well as higher solution qualities in a variety of situations.},

Due to national shutdowns, reduced transport logistics, and containment measures on the federal and provincial levels, the authorities could not meet the rising demand from the health care system on the PPE equipment. Fortunately, the PPE production capacities in China have regained (and expanded) their available capacities through which Austria now can get the demand of PPE to protect its citizens.ADAPT develops an adaptive and autonomous decision-making network to support the involved stakeholders along the PPE supply chain to save and protect human lives. The ADAPT decentralized blockchain platform optimizes supply, demand, and transport capacities between China and Austria with transparent, real-time certification checks on equipment, production documentation, and intelligent decision-making capabilities at all levels of this multidimensional logistic problem.},

abstract = {In recent years, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become increasingly more robust through the use of advanced technologies and accurate AI/ML models. However, incidents of crash and other untoward events involving AVs still get reported from time to time. In such situations, it is imperative that the cause be established - whether there was a problem with the sensors, actuators, model parameters or any other factor impacting the driving decision of the AV that resulted in the crash. This requires multiple parties like the automaker, sensor manufacturers, model developers and actuator suppliers to access the data logged by the AV during driving till the time of the incident. Although collaborating entities, they do not necessarily trust each other, especially in sensitive situations like investigating a crash. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel blockchain based method called AVChain for verifiable logging of data for each AV that can be selectively shared with the relevant parties under appropriate access control mechanisms. Scalability is achieved through the use of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storing the actual data while its hash is maintained in an enterprise blockchain like HyperLedger Fabric (HLF). We show the effectiveness and versatility of AVChain by generating data from CARLA - a widely used simulator for AVs, and invoking appropriate HLF chaincodes developed for this purpose. A browser based interface has also been designed to demonstrate the working of the complete infrastructure.},

Existing approaches for FRL either (a) do not provide any fault-tolerance guarantees (against misbehaving agents), or (b) rely on a trusted central agent (a single point of failure) for aggregating updates. We provide the first decentralized Byzantine fault-tolerant FRL method. Towards this end, we first propose a new centralized Byzantine fault-tolerant policy gradient (PG) algorithm that improves over existing methods by relying only on assumptions standard for non-fault-tolerant PG. Then, as our main contribution, we show how a combination of robust aggregation and Byzantine-resilient agreement methods can be leveraged in order to eliminate the need for a trusted central entity. Since our results represent the first sample complexity analysis for Byzantine fault-tolerant decentralized federated non-convex optimization, our technical contributions may be of independent interest. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results experimentally for common RL environments, demonstrating the speed-up of decentralized federations w.r.t. the number of participating agents and resilience against various Byzantine attacks.},

This interaction-oriented resolution is based on distributed value functions (DVF) techniques that decouple the multi-agent problem into a set of individual agent problems and consider possible interactions among agents as a separate layer. This leads to a significant reduction of the computational complexity by solving Dec-MDPs as a collection of MDPs. Using this model in multi-robot exploration scenarios, we show that each robot computes locally a strategy that minimizes the interactions between the robots and maximizes the space coverage of the team. Our technique has been implemented and evaluated in simulation and in real-world scenarios during a robotic challenge for the exploration and mapping of an unknown environment by mobile robots. Experimental results from real-world scenarios and from the challenge are given where our system was vice-champion.},

abstract = {Autonomous control methods (ACMs) are a promising approach to cope with the increasing complexity and dynamics of the business environment. In this context, sequencing flexibility provides great potential to increase the logistic performance of these methods. To optimally utilize this potential in production management, a quantification is required. However, the existing approaches to quantify sequencing flexibility are not suitable for the use in ACMs. Therefore, this article introduces a key figure to map sequencing flexibility based on precedence graphs for use in ACMs. For this purpose, requirements for the key figure are derived from the properties of autonomous control and a framework is presented which integrates this key figure into the decision-making process. The results are evaluated based on the presented requirements.},

The use of the technology has evolved from the automation of structured processes to systems that are truly revolutionary in that they introduce change into fundamental business procedures. Indeed, it is believed that “More than being helped by computers, companies will live by them, shaping strategy and structure to fit new information technology [25].” While the importance of the relationship between information technology and organizational change is evidenced by the considerable literature on the subject,1 there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of these issues from the economic perspective. The aim of this article is to develop an economic understanding of how information systems affect some key measures of organization structure.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in artificial intelligence are driving applications of robotics and automation in transport and logistics, providing new solutions to highway systems, passenger transport, last-mile delivery, and automated warehouses. Because the environment is dynamic and not entirely knowable, human supervision will be needed for the foreseeable future to solve unexpected problems. Research in other domains suggests that human-robot teams may even offer the optimal solution, as the relative strengths of human and artificial intelligence can be combined. However, realizing human-robot complementarity is challenging because sophisticated AI techniques lead to increasingly opaque robot control programs, and operators’ cognitive capacities can be exceeded as the sizes of autonomous fleets grow. We present our vision and initial results for a framework for human supervisory control and human robot teamwork for automated multi-vehicle systems.},

abstract = {The growing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), typically referred to as drones, poses new challenges on how to manage their operations in various internet of things (IoT) use cases such as surveillance and monitoring, weather prediction, agriculture, etc. The latter includes a massive number of devices that sometimes produce invalid messages due to lack of energy or system shutdown and needs to be autonomously monitored with drones in rural areas. In this paper, we develop a blockchain-based platform for managing drone IoT operations while maintaining trust and security. The test-bed consists of IoT devices, a drone and blockchain-enabled gateways through which drones are controlled to replace malfunctioning devices. The latter are detected using Z-score observation algorithm which launches a smart contract and sends the drone with clear operation order. The results obtained in realistic agriculture use case highlight the utility of our proposition in decreasing signaling and operation time, improving the percentage of successful maintenance operations and providing trust and security when managing drones in an autonomous manner.},

abstract = {Information systems are nowadays developed and implemented in organizations flavored by changes in their environment and work practices. For information systems (IS) developers this is reflected in terms of changes in the information needs of users during the development phase, increased requests for adaptive maintenance and sometimes in abandonment of a systems as “useless for the current situation”. These issues are often not considered to be the responsibility of IS developers, or simply seen as unfortunate facts of life. This paper takes a different view. If the analyst is able to provoke discussion concerning changes in the user organization, s/he may not only be able to avoid the aforementioned difficulties, but may also be able to bring added value to the  organization by supporting desired changes through IS design. This type of thinking has already been adopted in many of the methods used in strategic IS planning. The method presented in this paper is meant to be used in the process of analyzing user requirements in an individual IS project. It also provides rough guidelines for choosing between alternative design options during systems development. The method is illustrated in use by descriptions of three action research projects. In each project the role of IS in relation to changes in the user organization was analyzed, and advice was given on the client's specific IS problems. The advice was both understood and accepted by decision makers in each client organization.},

abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks such as Gnutella and Bit Torrent have revolutionised Internet based applications. P2P approaches provide a number of benefits, however most cycle stealing projects, such as SETI@home, have concentrated on centralised methods which still require massive amounts of concentrated network bandwidth in order to scale. More recent P2P research has developed the concept of distributed hash table (DHT) P2P overlays. These overlays provide efficient and guaranteed message delivery unlike earlier P2P networks which relied on large scale replication to probabilistically find data. Our G2:P2P framework makes use of a DHT overlay to provide a fully decentralised P2P cycle stealing system. Its distributed object programming model allows direct communication between objects and it remains reliable even as the set of peer nodes changes.In this paper we describe extensions to G2:P2P which allow us to optimise object distribution for locality. The importance of optimising data locality is well understood and has received extensive research, however, in the context of cycle-stealing systems and more generally DHT based P2P networks it is completely unexplored. Whilst our work is motivated by parallel programming, it is generic in nature and may have applicability to other DHT applications.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems have reached a tipping point, with a myriad of self-driving cars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and robots being widely applied and revolutionizing new applications. The continuous deployment of autonomous systems reveals the need for designs that facilitate increased resiliency and safety. The ability of an autonomous system to tolerate, or mitigate against errors, such as environmental conditions, sensor, hardware and software faults, and adversarial attacks, is essential to ensure its functional safety. Application-aware resilience metrics, holistic fault analysis frameworks, and lightweight fault mitigation techniques are being proposed for accurate and effective resilience and robustness assessment and improvement. This paper explores the origination of fault sources across the computing stack of autonomous systems, discusses the various fault impacts and fault mitigation techniques of different scales of autonomous systems, and concludes with challenges and opportunities for assessing and building next-generation resilient and robust autonomous systems.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are revolutionizing critical industries. Their inexpensive and accessible nature makes them useful for a number of broad applications including agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and more. In response to this popularity, UAV manufacturers, hobbyists, and researchers have developed myriad software packages for UAV control to simplify and automate UAV flight. Recent advances have also led to autonomous UAV that complete complex missions without human pilots and swarms of UAV that work together to solve tasks. Recently, researchers have used autonomy and swarms to allow UAV to cover wide areas quickly and intelligently. Few software packages explicitly support either autonomy and swarming for UAV, and none to our knowledge combine these features. We present early work on SoftwarePilot 2.0, a UAV software package that supports swarms of autonomous UAV. SoftwarePilot 2.0 improves on prior work to expand microservice model designs which are easier to manage using cloud-native technologies. SoftwarePilot 2.0's edge-efficient design allows UAV swarms to easily scale across the edge and cloud, and supports cutting edge autonomy techniques.},

abstract = {Currently, on one hand, there exist much work about network formation and/or growth models, and on the other hand, cooperative strategy evolutions are extensively investigated in biological, economic, and social systems. Generally, overlay networks are heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed environments managed by multiple administrative authorities, shared by users with different and competing interests, or even autonomously provided by independent and rational users. Thus, the structure of a whole overlay network and the peers' rational strategies are ever coevolving. However, there are very few approaches that theoretically investigate the coevolution between network structure and individual rational behaviors. The main motivation of our article lies in that: Unlike existing work which empirically illustrates the interaction between rational strategies and network structure (through simulations), based on EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory), we not only infer a condition that could favor the cooperative strategy over defect strategy, but also theoretically characterizes the structural properties of the formed network. Specifically, our contributions are twofold. First, we strictly derive the critical benefit-to-cost ratio (b/c) that would facilitate the evolution of cooperation. The critical ratio depends on the network structure (the number of peers in system and the average degree of each peer), and the evolutionary rule (the strategy and linking mutation probabilities). Then, according to the evolutionary rules, we formally derive the structural properties of the formed network in full cooperative state. Especially, the degree distribution is compatible with the power-law, and the exponent is (4-3v)/(1-3v), where v is peer's linking mutation probability. Furthermore, we show that, without being harmful to cooperation evolution, a slight change of the evolutionary rule will evolve the network into a small-world structure (high global efficiency and average clustering coefficient), with the same power-law degree distribution as in the original evolution model.},

abstract = {Ensuring the efficient and robust operation of distributed computational infrastructures is critical, given that their scale and overall complexity is growing at an alarming rate and that their management is rapidly exceeding human capability. Clustering analysis can be used to find patterns and trends in system operational data, as well as highlight deviations from these patterns. Such analysis can be essential for verifying the correctness and efficiency of the operation of the system, as well as for discovering specific situations of interest, such as anomalies or faults, that require appropriate management actions.This work analyzes the automated application of clustering for online system management, from the point of view of the suitability of different clustering approaches for the online analysis of system data in a distributed environment, with minimal prior knowledge and within a timeframe that allows the timely interpretation of and response to clustering results. For this purpose, we evaluate DOC (Decentralized Online Clustering), a clustering algorithm designed to support data analysis for autonomic management, and compare it to existing and widely used clustering algorithms. The comparative evaluations will show that DOC achieves a good balance in the trade-offs inherent in the challenges for this type of online management.},
