abstract = {Soft skills in general and teamwork skills in particular are increasingly important for students learning at universities. Teamwork is gaining prominence in various courses with different methods of implementation and proportion of time. However, studies have shown that the effectiveness of applying teamwork at public universities is far from expectation due to the differences in teamwork skills of students in different majors. The authors, therefore, conducted this study to investigate the perceptions of students in different majors at three public universities in Vietnam of learning teamwork skills. Data was collected via a survey of 500 students of five majors ranging from year 3 to year 4. All the participants had exposure to teamwork before being asked to complete the questionnaire. The findings revealed that there were significant differences in the perceptions of learning teamwork skills among the respondents. Accordingly, several crucial implications were grasped. First, the teaching of soft skills in general and teamwork skills in particular requires adjustments based on the above differences. Second, it is recommended that the effectiveness of learning teamwork skills in different majors be seriously taken into account instead of the arbitrary decision to implement this activity in teaching and learning.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of users' data in SaaS (Software-as-a-service) platforms using micro-services, it becomes essential to detect duplicated entities for ensuring the integrity and consistency of data in many companies and businesses (primarily multinational corporations). Due to the large volume of databases today, the expected duplicate detection algorithms need to be not only accurate but also practical, which means that it can release the detection results as fast as possible for a given request. Among existing algorithms for the deduplicate detection problem, using Siamese neural networks with the triplet loss has become one of the robust ways to measure the similarity of two entities (texts, paragraphs, or documents) for identifying all possible duplicated items. In this paper, we first propose a practical framework for building a duplicate detection system in a SaaS platform. Second, we present a new active learning schema for training and updating duplicate detection algorithms. In this schema, we not only allow the crowd to provide more annotated data for enhancing the chosen learning model but also use the Siamese neural networks as well as the triplet loss to construct an efficient model for the problem. Finally, we design a user interface of our proposed deduplicate detection system, which can easily apply for empirical applications in different companies.},

Due to the proliferation of mobile devices and the associated app-stores, the volume of new applications growing extremely fast requires a better way to analyze all possible malicious behaviors. In this paper, we investigate the malware prediction problem using system log files that contain numbers of sequences of system calls recorded from IoT devices. We construct a suitable multi-class classification model by using the combination of hand-crafted features, (including Bag-of-Ngrams, TF-IDF, and the statistical metrics computed from the consecutive repeated system calls in each log file). Also, we consider different machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, and measure the performance of each method in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. The experimental results show that a combination of different features, as well as using the Extreme Gradient Boosting technique, can help us to achieve promising performance in the dataset provided by the organizers of the competition CMDC 2019.},

abstract = {The First International Workshop on "Intelligence Cross-Data Analytics and Retrieval" (ICDAR'20) welcomes any theoretical and practical works on intelligence cross-data analytics and retrieval to bring the smart-sustainable society to human beings. We have witnessed the era of big data where almost any event that happens is recorded and stored either distributedly or centrally. The utmost requirement here is that data came from different sources, and various domains must be harmonically analyzed to get their insights immediately towards giving the ability to be retrieved thoroughly. These emerging requirements lead to the need for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary contributions that address different aspects of the problem, such as data collection, storage, protection, processing, and transmission, as well as knowledge discovery, retrieval, and security and privacy. Hence, the goal of the workshop is to attract researchers and experts in the areas of multimedia information retrieval, machine learning, AI, data science, event-based processing and analysis, multimodal multimedia content analysis, lifelog data analysis, urban computing, environmental science, atmospheric science, and security and privacy to tackle the issues as mentioned earlier.},

abstract = {Existing caching schemes process content objects (COs) individually based on the exact matching without considering the semantic correlation among content objects. We argue that this approach is inefficient in the Internet of Things (IoT) due to the highly redundant nature of IoT device deployments and the data accuracy tolerance of IoT applications. Therefore, the cache of a different CO having a high semantic correlation with another requested one by an application can be reused if the CO meets the data accuracy requirement of the application. In this case, caching both COs is inefficient. This paper extends the concept of cache hit and proposes a caching scheme considering the semantic content correlation of nodes to evaluate, construct, and enable the re-usability of available cached items to serve more diverse requests based on information correlation. For demonstrating its benefits, we implement the proposed scheme on the top of LFU (Least Frequently Used) for IoT data caching at the edge. Obtained experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves a significant cache hit ratio improvement in comparison with LFU.},

However, most of the technology mapping algorithms aim to optimize combinational logic with basic standard cells or LUT components. It is desirable to investigate optimal technology mappers for complex universal gates in addition to basic standard cells and LUT components. This paper proposes a novel technology mapper for complex universal gates with a tight integration of the following techniques: Boolean network simulation with permutation classification, supergate library construction, dynamic programming based cut enumeration, Boolean matching with optimal universal cell covering. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art technology mapper in ABC, in terms of both area and delay.},

abstract = {The Semantic Web augments the current WWW by giving information a well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation. This is done by adding machine understandable content to Web resources. Such added content is called metadata, whose semantics is provided by referring to an ontology---a domain's conceptualization agreed upon by a community. The Semantic Web relies on the complex interaction of several technologies involving ontologies. Therefore, sophisticated Semantic Web applications typically comprise more than one software module. Instead of coming up with proprietary solutions, developers should be able to rely on a generic infrastructure for application development in this context. We call such an infrastructure Application Server for the Semantic Web whose design and development are based on existing Application Servers. However, we apply and augment their underlying concepts for use in the Semantic Web and integrate semantic technology within the server itself. The article discusses requirements and design issues of such a server, presents our implementation KAON SERVER and demonstrates its usefulness by a detailed scenario.},

abstract = {The rise of software-based system control in safety-critical systems has made software safety a critical part of a system safety program. The risk of catastrophic software system failure increases with the growth of safety-critical technologies in autonomous transportation systems, airplanes, traffic control systems, medical surgery equipment, nuclear power centers, power grids, human-assist robotics, and military weaponry. Developing software control in safety-critical systems is challenging because the control needs to be reliable and safe. High-profile system failures in recent years, such as the crashes of the 737 MAX airliners, are constant reminders of the risk of software failure in safety-critical systems. The software quality assurance approaches used in software development today are insufficient for created for assuring software reliability but not safety. Developing functionally safe software requires incorporating a risk-driven approach that focuses on hazard identification, hazard risk anticipation, and mitigation. Software safety methods adoption in practice and across mainstream computer science and software engineering curriculums is still limited. Heeding the call for more publications on the practice of software safety, we present an integrated approach to software safety requirements engineering (SSRE). Engineering safety requirements for software is one of the most important steps in building safe software. First, we provide an overview of SSRE. Then we describe three hazard analysis methods that can be incorporated into a software requirement engineering process. Finally, discuss how we combine these distinct methods into a single SSRE approach to support safety-critical systems development.},

Synchronous e-learning (S-EL) was then employed to ensure the teaching and learning activities to run as scheduled. The decision was made when most of the universities in Vietnam had insufficient preparation for this mode of learning. This paper attempted to provide an objective evaluation of S-EL implementation among public universities in Vietnam. Also, the factors affecting the learning effectiveness were revealed and the factors that students would like their institutions to consider were pointed out as well.},

abstract = {In recent years, designing new effective Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures and loss functions are two crucial trends in improving face recognition (FR) accuracy. However, building an optimal DCNN and ameliorating FR performance are still the main challenges for researchers. Thus, we first investigate and analyzes the effect of several novel effective loss functions based on softmax on DCNN with the ResNet architecture. We then propose an ensemble learning, namely EnsFace, by taking advantage of recent novel FR methods based on CosFace, ArcFace, and MagFace. EnsFace elaborates on the voting mechanism that utilizes non-optimal pre-trained models to obtain better discriminative ability for FR. To prove the performance of both the speed and accuracy of EnsFace, we carry out rigorous experiments using several popular benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP, and AgeDB-30, as well as two renovations of LFW: CALFW and CPLFW. The results of our experiments achieve state-of-the-art figures, which show the proposed method’s massive potential to improve FR performance. Ablation studies and overall benchmarks undeniably prove the effectiveness of our EnsFace.},

For verification, however, they raise difficulties, which have not yet received a generally accepted solution. The present work introduces a proof rule meant to address these issues and allow verification tools to benefit from invariants.It clarifies the notion of invariant and identifies the three associated problems: callbacks, furtive access, and reference leak. As an example, the 2016 Ethereum DAO bug, in which $50 million was stolen, resulted from a callback invalidating an invariant.The discussion starts with a simplified model of computation and an associated proof rule, demonstrating its soundness. It then removes one by one the three simplifying assumptions, each removal raising one of the three issues and leading to a corresponding adaptation to the proof rule. The final version of the rule can tackle tricky examples, including “challenge problems” listed in the literature.},

abstract = {Web security is a big concern in the current Internet; users may visit websites that automatically download malicious codes for leaking user's privacy information, or even mildly their web browser may help for someone's cryptomining.In this paper, we analyze abusive web resources (i.e. malicious resources and cryptomining) crawled from the Alexa Top 150,000 sites.We highlight the abusive web resources on Alexa ranking, TLD usage, website geolocation, and domain lifetime. Our results show that abusive resources are spread in the Alexa ranking, websites particularly generic Top Level Domain (TLD) and their recently registered domains. In addition, websites with malicious resources are mainly located in China while cryptomining is located in USA. We further evaluate possible counter-measures against abusive web resources. We observe that ad or privacy block lists are ineffective to block against malicious resources while coin-blocking lists are powerful enough to mitigate in-browser cryptomining. Our observations shed light on a little studied, yet important, aspect of abusive resources, and can help increase user awareness about the malicious resources and drive-by mining on web browsers.},

abstract = {The world of employment has changed enormously together with the rise of globalization causing employability to become one of the main goals for education systems. Today's employers require employees to have soft skills in addition to technical skills. Therefore, this study was conducted to gain clear perceptions of four populations including students, teachers, employees and employers of the importance of soft skills at work. The results revealed that most of the participants emphasized the necessity of good soft skills. According to the employers, it is advisable to possess advanced soft skills in order to work effectively and productively. However, some of them expressed their disappointment to the employees who owned great technical skills but lacking of basic soft skills to adapt to a new working environment and company culture as well as to solve the problems arising at work. This issue is supposed to be closely correlated with the lack of soft skills training at university. Consequently, an obvious implication to universities in general and public universities in particular was grasped. It is important for higher education institutions to be aware of the need for soft skills for today's workplace so that they can provide essential soft skills training courses for their students.},

Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each one with its own mechanism and sometimes with a different notion of community. In this article, we bring most common methods in the literature together in a comparative approach and reveal their performances in both real-world networks and synthetic networks. Surprisingly, many of those methods discovered better communities than the declared ground-truth communities in terms of some topological goodness features, even on benchmarking networks with built-in communities. We illustrate different structural characteristics that these methods could identify in order to support users to choose an appropriate method according to their specific requirements on different structural qualities.},

We evaluated TapeBlocks by interviewing makers, special educational needs teachers and support coaches. Analysis of these interviews informed the design of a series of maker workshops using TapeBlocks with young adults living with intellectual disabilities, led by support coaches with support from the research team. Participants were able to engage with TapeBlocks and making, eventually building their own TapeBlocks to make personal creations. Our evaluation reveals how TapeBlocks supports accessible making and playful discovery of electronics for people living with disabilities, and addresses a gap in existing toolkits by being tinkerable, affordable and having a low threshold for engagement.},

abstract = {Misuse of real photographs with conflicting image captions in news items is one case of out-of-context (OOC) misuse of media. To detect out-of-context given pair of news (i.e., captions) and attached image, people should determine the truthfulness of the statement and evaluate whether the triplet talks to the same event. This paper presents a new method to detect the OOC media challenge introduced in ACMMM'22 Grand Challenge on Detecting Cheapfakes. For $Task_1$ (i.e., detect conflicting image-caption triplets), our approach uses bottom-up attention with visual semantic reasoning to extract global features of the image to perform comprehensive image-text matching, multiple models of natural language processing to extract semantic relation of the caption and utilize boosting to improve the accuracy of the performance. Our method achieved an 85.5\% accuracy score on 80\% of the testing dataset and has 4.5\% higher accuracy than baseline. For Task2 (i.e., determine whether a given (Image, Caption) pair is real or fake), we detect the veracity of captioned image base semantic features and correlation between image/caption and achieve 76\% accuracy.

We found that those surveys are basically studying the blockchain-based applications, such as blockchain-assisted Internet of Things (IoT), business applications, security-enabled solutions, and many other applications in diverse fields. However, we think that a comprehensive survey toward the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized for future research directions. We hope this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.},

abstract = {Recently, a fuzzy logic technique - based control strategy has become one of the most efficient control schemes in dealing with complicated and nonlinear control systems. The working principle of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is based on experiences of experts, thereby it should be one of the artificial intelligence controllers which can efficiently replace with conventional regulators. This paper concentrates on the design of a typical PI-type FLC incorporation with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The PSO algorithm is used to successfully determine three scaling factors of the PI-type FLC, thereby the proposed control strategy will be able to obtain much better control performances in comparison with the conventional regulator and/or the FLCs applying the other optimization counterparts, i.e. genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE) algorithm. This study also investigates feasible solutions for the load-frequency control (LFC) problem of an interconnected hydroelectric power system. In fact, the LFC problem is one of the most important control issues of multi-area interconnected hydroelectric power systems. Comparative simulations with conventional PID regulators, PD-type FLC, GA- and DE-based PI-like FLCs will be implemented in this study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSO-based PI-type FLC. The control quality of the proposed control approach revealing through major control criteria obtained, such as overshoots, steady-state error and settling time, is much better than that of the other controllers for solving the LFC problem of a hydropower system.},

It has been used to the efficient exploration and querying of large and heterogeneous knowledge bases based on semantic networks in the Information and Document Retrieval domains. ONTOSPREAD implements the double process of activation and spreading of concepts in ontologies applying different restrictions of the original model like weight degradation according to the distance or others coming from the extension of this technique like the converging paths reward. It is considered to be relevant to support the recommendation of concepts for tagging clinical records and to provide a tool for decision-support in clinical diagnosis. Finally an evaluation methodology and two examples using the well-known ontologies Galen and SNOMED CT are presented to validate the goodness, the improvement and the capabilities of this technique applied to medical systems.},

abstract = {Hacks on blockchains are prevalent nowadays because a wide range of vulnerabilities exists in smart contracts. To deal with the vulnerabilities, security auditing has been emerging and widely adopted for manual code inspection. However, little is known about how manual security auditing impacts the blockchain community. In this work, we investigated security audits on blockchain by answering three research questions covering the type, severity, and resolve status of issues in the audit reports. We in total collected 2,421 security audit reports consisting of the details of 28,782 security issues. We found that manual security auditing has superior merit over static analysis tools in identifying logic-related issues, considering 27.65\% of all findings are logical issues. We also found that 87.28\% of 2,421 projects have at least one centralization issue that breaks the decentralization primitive of blockchain. Moreover, while 21.17\% of issues are of major or critical severity, we surprisingly found that 61.83\% of all issues were unresolved or partially resolved. We concluded that while manual security auditing can help identify security vulnerabilities uniquely, project developers need to take serious actions to address and secure their smart contracts.},

Supporting this trend, customizable embedded FPGAs are an ingredient in ASIC architectures to provide the advantages of reconfigurable hardware exactly where and how it is most beneficial. To enable this, we are introducing the FABulous embedded open-source FPGA framework. FABulous is designed to fulfill the objectives of ease of use, maximum portability to different process nodes, good control for customization, and delivering good area, power, and performance characteristics of the generated FPGA fabrics. The framework provides templates for logic, arithmetic, memory, and I/O blocks that can be easily stitched together, whilst enabling users to add their own fully customized blocks and primitives. The FABulous ecosystem generates the embedded FPGA fabric for chip fabrication, integrates Yosys, ABC, VPR and nextpnr as FPGA CAD tools, deals with the bitstream generation and after fabrication tests. Additionally, we provide an emulation path for system development. FABulous was demonstrated for an ASIC integrating a RISC-V core with an embedded FPGA fabric for custom instruction set extensions using a TSMC 180nm process and an open-source 45nm process node.},

abstract = {When developing peer-to-peer applications on distributed ledger technology (DLT), a crucial decision is the selection of a suitable DLT design (e.g., Ethereum), because it is hard to change the underlying DLT design post hoc. To facilitate the selection of suitable DLT designs, we review DLT characteristics and identify trade-offs between them. Furthermore, we assess how DLT designs account for these trade-offs and we develop archetypes for DLT designs that cater to specific requirements of applications on DLT. The main purpose of our article is to introduce scientific and practical audiences to the intricacies of DLT designs and to support development of viable applications on DLT.},

abstract = {Mobile applications - or apps - are one of the main reasons for the unprecedented success smart phones and tablets have experienced over the last decade. Apps are the main interfaces that users deal with when engaging in online banking, checking travel itineraries, or browsing their social network profiles while on the go. Previous research has studied various aspects of mobile application security including data leakage and privilege escalation through confused deputy attacks. However, the vast majority of mobile application research targets Google's Android platform. Few research papers analyze iOS applications and those that focus on the Apple environment perform their analysis on comparatively small datasets (i.e., thousands in iOS vs. hundreds of thousands in Android). As these smaller datasets call into question how representative the gained results are, we propose, implement, and evaluate CRiOS, a fully-automated system that allows us to amass comprehensive datasets of iOS applications which we subject to large-scale analysis. To advance academic research into the iOS platform and its apps, we plan on releasing CRiOS as an open source project.We also use CRiOS to aggregate a dataset of 43,404 iOS applications. Equipped with this dataset we analyze the collected apps to identify third-party libraries that are common among many applications. We also investigate the network communication endpoints referenced by the applications with respect to the endpoints' correct use of TLS/SSL certificates. In summary, we find that the average iOS application consists of 60.2\% library classes and only 39.8\% developer-authored content. Furthermore, we find that 9.32\% of referenced network connection endpoints either entirely omit to cryptographically protect network communications or present untrustworthy SSL certificates.},

Even though GasTokens had a period of significant activity on Ethereum (regularly surpassing half of the overall weekly smart contract creation and destruction activities), few systematic studies have been conducted on GasToken usage and its effect on the blockchain network. This paper focuses on understanding the adoption of GasTokens on Ethereum since May of 2020. We first analyze the usage patterns, including the creation, destruction, and holding of GasTokens, then report several price findings related to GasTokens, and compare the fees paid by users submitting transactions that create and destroy GasTokens to the fees paid by all the transactions in the network over different time periods. We characterize the benefits obtained by GasToken transaction senders and report the impact of GasToken creations and destructions on the major mining pools.},

However, effectively embedding employee voice systems in organisations requires designers to engage with the social processes, power relations and contextual factors of individual workplaces. We explore this process within a university workplace through a research project responding to a crisis in educational service delivery arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Within a successful three-month staff-led engagement, we examined the intricacies of embedding employee voice, exploring how the interactions between existing actors impacted the effectiveness of the process. We sought to identify specific actions to promote employee voice and overcome barriers to its successful establishment in organisational decision-making. We highlight design considerations for an effective employee voice system that facilitates embedding employee voice, including assurance, bounded accountability and bias reflexivity.},

abstract = {Internet of Things, is an innovative technology which allows the connection of physical things with the digital world through the use of heterogeneous networks and communication technologies. The Routing Protocol for low power and Lossy networks (RPL) is standardized as a routing protocol for LLNs. However, more and more of experimental results demonstrate that RPL performs poorly in throughput and adaptability to network dynamics. In this study, we applied properties of arrangement graphs to design a newly structured routing protocol, extension of RPL, named as Arrangement Graph based Adaptive routing protocol ARG-RPL that enhances the supports of high throughput, adaptivity and mobility for RPL without any modification or assumption on the OFs. In such protocol, the IDs between the two adjacent nodes differ only one digit and thus, self configuration and self optimization in LLNs networks are easy while keeping the low maintenance cost. Distributed algorithms have been developed, consisting of two stages: initialization stage and reactive routing discovery stage. We implement ARG-RPL on the Contiki operating system, and construct extensive evaluation using a large-scale simulations on Cooja. Analysis of experimental results show that the establishment of the system and the routing processing could achieve better performance than those obtained in the RPL and ER-RPL.},

abstract = {There has been an increasing focus on teaching youth about design ethics as part of technical literacy. Biowearables are an emerging technology in which devices worn on children's bodies are used to track, monitor and provide feedback about their biological processes. In this paper we describe an online critical making workshop designed to enable students in middle school years to develop technical literacy skills that include reflection on issues related to design ethics. We investigated if and how our workshop enabled eleven youth, aged 12-14, to reflect through processes of making their own biowearable, on potential negative impacts of biowearables on their developing senses of identity, agency, autonomy and authenticity. The workshop elements included facilitated activities using custom created biowearable-tangible kit and ethics cards. Through qualitative coding and thematic analysis of moments of reflection captured with video, chat, and design journals we gathered evidence of the feasibility of promoting critical making as a means to cultivate technical literacy in youth. Our findings suggest the potential of teaching design ethics through critical making workshops and reveal a range of ways that reflection on ethical issues can be supported during making. We interpret our empirical evidence to further explore how workshop elements supported, or failed to support, learning outcomes and generalize our interpretations to propose preliminary guidance about workshop mechanisms that might be used to support ethical reflection during making.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an interactive multimodal lifelog retrieval system with the search engine built by utilizing the attention mechanism. The algorithm upon which the system relies is constructed by applying two observations: (1) most of the images belonged to one event probably contain cues (e.g., objects) that relate to the content of queries. These cues contribute to the representative of the event, and (2) instances of one event can be associated with the content and context of such an event. Hence, when we can determine the seed (by leveraging the first observation), we can find all relevant instances (by utilizing the second observation). We also take a benefit of querying by samples (e.g., images) by converting text query to images using the attention-based mechanism. Thus, we can enrich and add more semantic meaning into the simple text query of users towards having more accurate results, as well as discovering hidden results that cannot reach by using only text queries. The system is designed for both novice and expert users with several filters to help users express their queries from general to particular descriptions and to polish their results.},

abstract = {Smart contracts (SC) are one of the most appealing features of blockchain technologies facilitating, executing, and enforcing predefined terms of coded contracts without intermediaries. The steady adoption of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain has led to tens of thousands of contracts holding millions of dollars in digital currencies and small mistakes during the development of SC on immutable blockchains have already caused substantial losses and involve the danger for future incidents. Hence, today the secure development of smart contracts is an important topic and several attacks and incidents related to vulnerable smart contracts could have been avoided. To foster a secure development process of SC this paper summarizes known vulnerabilities in smart contracts found by literature research and analysis. It compares currently available code analysis tools for their capabilities to identify and detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts based on a taxonomy for vulnerabilities. Finally, based on the TheDOA attack the paper shows an example for the adoption of best practices to avoid severe vulnerabilities in smart contracts.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a QoT and spectrum-fragmentation-aware dynamic control scheme to enable dynamic lightpath provisioning in distributed multi-domain elastic optical networks. The developed scheme employs a spectrum-fragmentation-aware routing algorithm in combination with a QoT-aware route selection method. It is capable of routing and assigning modulation formats to lightpaths adaptively to effectively deal with the spectrum fragmentation problem and the restriction on the optical transparent reach in multi-domain elastic optical networks. In order to exploit the advantages of distributed control architecture and enhance network performance, our proposed dynamic QoT-aware lightpath provisioning scheme also applies a flexible double resource reservation mechanism for reserving necessary resources and establishing the lightpaths. Performance of the proposed solution is evaluated by using numerical experiments and is compared to that of the traditional approach with a simple shortest-path-based algorithm. The simulation results prove that our proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional one and offers a significant performance improvement, says more than 40\% blocking probability reduction.},

abstract = {In the information age, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of data use and ensure the security and stability of data. This paper constructs an identity-based proxy re-encryption scheme based on the Learning with Rounding (LWR) problem on the lattice. The scheme uses the pre-image sampling technique to obtain the private key. When the message is encrypted, it is encrypted with a deterministic encryption algorithm. The algorithm encrypts each plaintext to generate a unique ciphertext, thereby improving the efficiency of encryption and decryption. In the proxy re-encryption scheme, the proxy is often semi-honest, so the homomorphic signature technology is introduced to detect whether the proxy calculates honestly and realize the verifiability of re-encryption. Finally, Honest Re-Encryption Attack (HRA) security, as an enhanced Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA) security, can better capture the target of proxy re-encryption, enabling the constructed scheme to provide more robust security in practical applications.},

Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Lifelogging is known as the new trend of writing diary digitally where both the surrounding environment and personal physiological data and cognition are collected at the same time under the first perspective. Exploring and exploiting these lifelog (i.e., data created by lifelogging) can provide useful insights for human beings, including healthcare, work, entertainment, and family, to name a few. Unfortunately, having a valuable tool working on lifelog to discover these insights is still a tough challenge. To meet this requirement, we introduce an interactive multimodal retrieval system that aims to provide people with two functions, memory assistant and life organized support, with a friendly and easy-to-use web UI. The output of the former function is a video with footages expressing all instances of events people want to recall. The latter function generates a statistical report of each event so that people can have more information to balance their lifestyle. The system relies on two major algorithms that try to match keywords/phrases to images and to run a cluster-based query using a watershed-based approach.},
