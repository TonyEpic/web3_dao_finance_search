  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) offer transparency and integrity in decision-making, but their decentralized structure presents challenges during times of crisis. Our paper implements and demonstrates a solution to this issue by introducing a quasi DAO (qDAO) that allows for centralized decision-making when necessary. By modifying smart contracts and introducing new rules, we strike a balance between decentralization and centralized management, offering potential opportunities for improved crisis management in DAOs. We present a demo of our qDAO implementation on the local Ethereum testnet, along with a web application for user input. Our approach expands the possibilities of DAO administrator control while maintaining the integrity and auditability of DAO operations.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of the transportation industry, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) tries to adapt to industry changes through constructing new organizational forms, management methods, and incentive mechanisms. However, many new governance issues have arisen due to the transportation system’s complexity, diversity, and uncertainty. DAO(Decentralized autonomous organization) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts are regarded as effective methods to solve the organizational governance problems for complex systems. Therefore, this article analyzes the main issues currently faced by ITS. Then, this paper proposed a 6-layer DAO structure framework for ITS and discussed its key research issues. Finally, a case study for the Macau transportation system is carried out, and further research directions are proposed. The DAO-based transportation system will represent the future trend of ITS development. This paper aims to motivate more discussion for this new direction and provide helpful guidance and reference for future research work.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={2},
  pages={2853-2862},
  abstract={The governance technology of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provides an effective solution for solving existing organizational management issues. Governance mechanisms of DAOs are usually encoded in smart contracts in the form of rule sets and executed automatically. However, the mechanism’s logical flaws and code errors expose DAOs to unpredictable risks. Complex adaptive dynamics computer-aided design (CadCAD) can test the effectiveness of the mechanisms through simulation. Nonetheless, as DAOs are typical complex systems with social and engineering complexity, managing, controlling, and supervising their operation through traditional methods are difficult. The parallel intelligence theory based on artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method provides an effective research framework and practical method for solving DAOs’ governance issues. Therefore, in this article, we propose a parallel mechanism verification method and execution system, namely, complex adaptive systems for computer-aided dynamic design (casCAD2) as an extension of cadCAD. Leveraging parallel intelligence and cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS), casCAD2 is capable of probing into the laws that govern system evolution within a simulated environment. It serves as a robust tool for verifying the efficacy of DAOs’ mechanisms and predicting their potential risks. We also build a parallel market-based anchoring mechanism (MAM) system to demonstrate how it can be used for DAOs’ mechanism verification. This study can provide a new research method and application system for DAOs’ effective governance.},

  abstract={Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) is one kind of advanced air traffic control radars that provide aircraft position and identification to air traffic controllers. However, with the rapid growth in air traffic, it brings two problems that hinder the continuous aircraft surveillance to current separated SSR systems. To solve these problems, Autonomous Continuous Target Tracking Technology (ACTTT) with a decentralized network structure has been proposed. In the system, SSRs are connected to a network, and autonomously coordinate for continuous tracking by sharing target information. In this paper, the Autonomous Decentralized Surveillance System architecture is proposed and clarified. Then, based on this architecture the validity of proposed technology is proved by computer simulations in multi-node environments. Moreover, the practical experiments are implemented based on the real system which consists of two networked SSRs with ACTTT functions. The results of simulations and experiments show the effectiveness of proposed system architecture and technology for achieving continuous aircraft surveillance.},

  abstract={The potential of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to reduce on-board system costs in autonomous vehicles through shared intelligence is considerable. However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.},

  abstract={Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their promise of realizing the decentralized Web 3.0. However, most DAOs rely heavily on token-centric value systems as well as allocate decision-making authority and yield-sharing rights according to the held tokens, which often lead to monopolization of power and rights. To address this issue, this paper contributes to propose a truly democratic organization model, named True Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), that does not count upon tokens and is guided by principles of contribution-based and on-demand allocation. We first discuss the design of TAOs, including their infrastructures, power structures, and value systems, and then provide a technical roadmap for implementing TAOs in the DeSci context. This research can provide a valuable guidance for the construction and application of TAOs.},

  abstract={Research related to digital assets & ownership is currently rising along with the escalation utilization of Blockchain through various use cases and its derevatives, for example in facilitating Digital Assets in the form of virtual property (virtual houses / buildings and virtual land) in the Metaverse. These digital assets often have utilities, features, and even limited copies of quantities so that these digital objects have more value for specific users on a platform and even general people who are interested in and value them. To be able to preserve the value of digital assets in the Metaverse such as virtual property previously mentioned especially for transactions, a set of regulations/governance, as well as sustainable development in the future in the Metaverse is really needed so that the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in the metaverse is one way to maintain the sustainability of the ecosystem & market and its potential of virtual property. After conducting research for DAO development for virtual property transactions, starting with determining goals & purposes, breaking down the DAO focus object (virtual property), clustering relevant attributes, matching socio-economic impacts, and finally designing smart contracts & governance consensus, we obtained 4 main layers namely Consensus Governance, Smart Contract, Virtual Property & Socio-Economic.},

  abstract={Decentralized science (DeSci) is a hot topic emerging with the development of Web3 or Web3.0 and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and operations. DeSci fundamentally differs from the centralized science (CeSci) and Open Science (OS) movement built in the centralized way with centralized protocols. It changes the basic structure and legacy norms of current scientific systems via reshaping the cooperation mode, value system, and incentive mechanism. As such, it can provide a viable path for solving bottleneck problems in the development of science, such as oligarchy, silos, and so on, and make science more fair, free, responsible, and sensitive. However, DeSci itself still faces many challenges, including scaling, balancing the quality of participants, system suboptimal loops, lack of accountability mechanism, and so on. Taking these into consideration, this article presents a systematic introduction of DeSci, proposes a novel reference model with a six-layer architecture, addresses the potential applications, and also outlines the key research directions in this emerging field.

  pages={118-125},
  abstract={Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends.

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.},

Therefore, in air traffic, the situation is dynamically changing from moment to moment, from position to position. Under this dynamic changing situation, air traffic control radar systems are required to monitor aircraft with high safety. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) has been accomplishing this difficult work for a long time. As the number of aircraft with new capability increases, SSR is suffering from data traffic congestions between aircraft and SSR Ground Station (GS).

  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have emerged as an interesting new category of software application. Initial applications are disrupting the finance industry, but the technology is not restricted to fintech applications or assets. While other devices or software applications also claim to be autonomous, in many cases there have been levels proposed to scale or categorize the degree of autonomy afforded those applications. This notion of a level of autonomy is particularly important for consumer awareness as these autonomous devices and applications scale out to mass-market services. The societal impact from the operationalization of these technologies can be significant in terms of safety, security, privacy, and the consequences of failures. This article develops a proposed measure of autonomy for DAOs based on the existing legal/financial concept of liabilities.},

This overview helps to understand the current adoption of this technology and also deduces factors that are inhibiting its use in the modern organization. This study provides a systematic review of previous studies comprising of frameworks, methods, working prototypes and simulations that demonstrate the application of smart contracts in organizations. Understanding the current state and usage of smart-contract technology in an organization is a focal point of this paper. Much progress occurs in developing technologies that support smart contracts, while little understanding exists pertaining to their usage in organizations. In this study, we identify properties of smart-contract applications in different domains of modern organizations. We further analyze and categorize challenges and problems mitigating the adoption of smart-contract applications.},

  abstract={Services Oriented Architectures (SOA) represents a new model in the traditional way of designing systems because it is constructed around individual processes of different areas in an organization. In recent years, the necessity to integrate critical applications in a SOA has increased, that is the case of the Financial Applications. These applications require high reliability, information consistency and timeliness that are not satisfied by conventional SOA infrastructures. In this article we present a novel approach of combining SOA with Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADS) in order to provide an infrastructure that can satisfy those requirements. We have named this infrastructure Autonomous Decentralized Service Oriented Architecture (ADSOA). We present the concept and architecture of ADSOA, as well as the basic technologies for its realization. Moreover, a real implementation in a mission critical banking transaction processing system is shown in order to prove its effectiveness.},

  abstract={The present research utilizes Topic Modelling as a methodology to acquire a deeper understanding of the goals and operations of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs). This is achieved by examining textual data derived from the proposals put forth by these organizations. The issue at hand pertains to comprehending the multitude of ideas inside Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) and their alignment with the respective objectives of these entities. Through the application of Topic Modelling, we aim to investigate textual patterns, identify topics, and discern significant themes within the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) ecosystem. This research endeavor seeks to address the existing research gaps pertaining to the alignment of proposals with organizational objectives. This research aims to fill these knowledge gaps by examining the unique thematic priorities of various decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), providing insights into their functions, and elucidating their involvement in investment, community, technological, and monetary issues. Through the utilization of experimental research, this research provides DAO stakeholders with the ability to make wellinformed judgements, prioritize ideas, and customize methods in order to more effectively match with their distinct missions and objectives.

  abstract={This paper presents Management-Oriented Operating Systems (M2OS) that leverages the power of parallel intelligence theory, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and foundation models to revolutionize the manner of management in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). The parallel architecture on M2OS is proposed, including the parallel interactive actual M2OS and artificial M2OS. Among them, the artificial M2OSs provide digital infrastructures for organizations to operate, collaborate, and make decisions in the virtual space, and conduct computational experiments to evaluate management decisions and predict future states of the actual M2OS. Through parallel execution and closed-loop feedback between the artificial and actual M2OSs, the management and control, experimentation and evaluation, as well as learning and training of the actual M2OS can be realized. Moreover, the functional layers of M2OS, including the infrastructure layer, data layer, scenario layer, modeling layer, decision layer, and application layer, are discussed. These layers work together to support the intelligent, autonomous, collaborative, and adaptive nature of the M2OS, and facilitate data-driven decision-making, optimize business operations, and empower managers with real-time actionable insights. The proposed M2OS paradigm has great potential to transform the management paradigm and opens up new possibilities for intelligent and collaborative decision-making.},

  abstract={Student non-profit organizations are a specific type of small associations that congregate students from diverse backgrounds around a common purpose. These organizations are non-profit driven, autonomous, and typically have largely similar statutes and regulations. In the context of software engineering, information systems that support their business processes have similar software requirements specifications. DESPRO is a web-based platform that fully supports principal use cases of students' non-profit organizations. The platform has three uses: accounting, voting, and fundraising management. DESPRO allows such organizations to begin with their principal operations practically immediately without unnecessary overhead. Unique features that distinguish DESPRO from other similar systems are: 1) lightweight and streamlined deployment process, 2) minimal required remote maintenance, 3) pre-defined functionalities specifically suited for student non-profit organizations, 4) user anonymity customized to specific functional requirements, 5) voting without prior user registration. The platform was developed with open-source technologies Node.js, Vue.js, Vuetify, Bootstrap, Sequalize, Axios, Web3, MariaDB, and smart contracts for Ethereum.

  abstract={Blockchain is an emerging technology that finds applications across various industries by providing secure transaction records that cannot be tampered with. It operates as a decentralized and open ledger, offering additional benefits such as traceability and immutability, which greatly contribute to its desirability. Two important blockchain applications include Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) Marketplaces and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). NFTs are unique digital assets like artwork or music that can be bought and sold using cryptocurrency, ensuring both security and efficiency. On the other hand, DAOs are transparent organizations that make decentralized decisions. In our work, we have developed an integrated NFT marketplace and DAO that leverages NFT ownership to determine the weights of choices. The implementation is based on Ethereum ERC-721 tokens. However, the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm used in Ethereum 2.0 lacks fairness. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Delegated Reputation-based Proof of Elapsed Time consensus algorithm (DRPoET). Evaluations conducted on an Ethereum testbed demonstrate that our integrated DAO benefits from fair weights and improved transaction latency and fairness compared to the POS algorithm.},

  abstract={The new generation of digital intelligence technology enables knowledge creation, dissemination, and application to undergoing parallel changes. Scientific systems face an increasingly uncertain, diverse, and complex environment, making adopting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches to research issues inevitable. Existing scientific systems follow linear value streams, leading to problems, such as inefficiency, unfairness, and knowledge monopoly. Decentralized science (DeSci) is a new scientific development paradigm based on Web3, Metaverses, and decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs) technologies, that can solve organizational and management problems in scientific systems through organizing, coordinating, and executing techniques. However, new economic theories and methods are still needed to effectively solve the problem of linear value flow in scientific systems. Metaeconomics based on the parallel intelligence theory, also known as decentralized economics (DeEco), provides a new approach and idea for redesigning the economic system of scientific markets. Thus, this article proposes a research framework and core mechanisms of DeSci MetaMarkets based on parallel economic theory to provide effective and practical methodologies for scientific system governance.},

  abstract={With the development of intelligent transportation technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces challenges such as data silos, security and privacy concerns, data quality issues, and collaboration barriers. To address the various challenges, this paper proposes an innovative integration scheme called the IoV Data Management System (IDMS). This system is built upon blockchain and parallel intelligence technologies, aiming to solve the challenges presented in the IoV domain. The proposed system uses the decentralized, immutable and traceable characteristics of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanism and collaboration model of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), to build a secure and trusted data sharing platform to solve data problems in IoV. This research combines parallel intelligence, blockchain and DAO technologies to provide an innovative framework for IoV information management. The proposed framework enables parallel management of connected vehicle systems, thereby improving safety, reliability and efficiency. Furthermore, it would promote the development and application of vehicle networking technology, and provide more intelligent, convenient and safe services for people's travel experience. Finally, a parking data sharing case study validates the effectiveness of the designed system and demonstrates its potential to solve IoV data management challenges.},

  abstract={Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology relies on wireless communication and coordination, aiming to improve road safety and traffic efficiency by orchestrating the interaction among the vehicles, infrastructures, and various entities. However, existing organizational and operational forms of V2X infrastructures encounter significant challenges, such as the capability to guarantee communication security, privacy, and efficiency especially when a centralized management system is used. The emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations (DAOs) present a solution to these challenges. DAOs embed managerial and operational protocols within a blockchain via smart contracts, facilitating smooth and efficient management of organizations without the necessity for centralized oversight. This letter introduces DAOs into the coordination of V2X infrastructures. Through a tripartite functional architecture including organization, coordination, and execution, we can achieve intelligent collaborative management among road infrastructures and vehicles. The DAO-secured V2X infrastructures are anticipated to augment the safety and efficiency of vehicular management in complex road scenarios, holding applicable potential for developing the intelligent roadways of tomorrow.},

Consequently, management strategies are not tailored to human needs and are inadequate in providing transportation intelligence. This article investigates a management architecture based on decentralized/distributed autonomous operations/organizations (DAOs) that considers both the technical and societal aspects in our transportation metaverse, TransVerse. This design maps people’s transportation needs in physical space to their digital counterparts in cyberspace, utilizing blockchain technology to guarantee the secure exchange of information and ultimately bring about the Internet of Minds (IoM). With the federated intelligence that emerged in IoM, we can devise reliable and prompt traffic decisions by incorporating consensus, community voting, and smart contracts into the organizational, coordination, and execution structure. Details on operational procedures and key technologies are also covered. To demonstrate the efficacy of DAOs-based management, a case study of world model-driven cooperative signal control is provided, indicating its promising application in future transportation management.},

  abstract={The advent of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous innovations in online governance, with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) emerging as a prominent development, often referred to as “digital jurisdictions.” Despite experiencing remarkable growth, currently boasting nearly 7M users and   ${\$}$  18 billion in assets, DAOs remain relatively underexplored in the existing literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

  abstract={Intelligent Vehicles (IVs), integrating sensing, communication, and computing technologies, have immense potential to elevate efficiency, reduce traffic accidents, and diminish emissions. However, since faulty decisions made by IVs may endanger the safety of people's lives and property, improper trust in these automated systems could potentially lead to significant risks and problems. The trust issues in IVs stems not only from technological immaturity but also from the inability of automation systems to handle complex social relationships. TRUE Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), underpinned by blockchain and smart contracts, propose a code-governed, trustworthy human-machine collaboration model, offering a promising approach to tackle those challenges. This paper introduces TAOs into IVs to propose an innovative human-machine collaboration system namely IV-TAOs, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness between humans and IVs. The architecture of IV-TAOs is formulated, with an exploration of both their characteristics and associated risk issues. This work provides a new perspective on addressing the trust issues encompassing but not confined solely within the context of intelligent vehicles.},

  volume={32},

  pages={5654-5663},
  abstract={In this article, a decentralized optimal tracking control problem has been studied for a large-scale autonomous vehicle system with heterogeneous system dynamics. Due to the ultralarge number of agents, the notorious “curse of dimension” problem as well as the unrealistic assumption of the existence of reliable very large-scale communication links in uncertain environments have challenged the traditional multiagent system (MAS) algorithms for decades. The emerging mean-field game (MFG) theory has recently been widely adopted to generate a decentralized control method that deals with those challenges by encoding the large scale MASs’ information into a novel time-varying probability density functions (PDF) which can be obtained locally. However, the traditional MFG methods assume all agents are homogeneous, which is unrealistic in practical industrial applications, e.g., Internet of Things (IoTs), and so on. Therefore, a novel mean-field Stackelberg game (MFSG) is formulated based on the Stackelberg game, where all the agents have been classified as two different categories where one major leader’s decision dominates the other minor agents. Moreover, a hierarchical structure that treats all minor agents as a mean-field group is developed to tackle the assumption of homogeneous agents. Then, the actor-actor–critic–critic-mass ( $A^{2}C^{2}M$ ) algorithm with five neural networks is designed to learn the optimal policies by solving the MFSG. The Lyapunov theory is utilized to prove the convergence of  $A^{2}C^{2}M$  neural networks and the closed-loop system’s stability. Finally, a series of numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

  abstract={Web service demand is heterogeneous and it is expanding day by day. Malicious web attacks particularly at application layer, are also increasing significantly. It is estimated eighty percent (80%) malicious attacks are web application layer attacks such as Cross Site Scripting and SQL injection. Such attacks have affected financial organizations, government institutes, hospitals and enterprise companies and so on. It is required to detect such attacks instantly to maintain the safe operations. Existing Web Application Firewalls (WAF) aim at protection of web application attacks using Black and White list based approach. Black list based WAFs operate at security operation center (SOC) to protect known attacks and it is easy to maintain same black list by other WAF nodes. However, white list independent signature from each Web service and it is generated by each web site policy. When the event of WAF fails, other WAF doesn't have same level of White list at that time. Black list is common type of signature and it can be keep the assurance by multiple WAF nodes or proxy node but White list is individual type of signature and can't maintain assurance by same policy of node. Therefore, to maintain high detection rate, dynamic adaptability of White list is required. It also requires online property and timeliness response. To solve these issues, an integrated Autonomous Decentralized Multi Layer Cache (ADMLC) system with Web Application Firewall is proposed. Evaluation shows that proposed architecture detection rate is much better than other traditional WAF based systems.},

  abstract={Smart cities have emerged as one of the most promising applications of cyber-physical systems (CPS), carrying the potential to serve the various interests of the public and private sectors at large. However, contemporary smart city infrastructure commonly uses heavily-centralized network architectures, reducing failure resilience and application flexibility. This centralization also imposes high barriers to entry for public access, limiting usage and oversight opportunities. To address these limitations, we describe Arbiter, a novel fog- and edge-based communication architecture based on the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Arbiter aims to improve the socioeconomic equity of the local citizenry by (1) acting as a management layer for citywide CPS assets, (2) providing a compliance layer for managing human capital, and (3) offering a data protection layer to ensure that citizens retain full control of their personal data. We then analyze in detail the technical, socioeconomic, and ethical implications of Arbiter, and contextualize its role in the modern smart city.},

  abstract={The rapid onboarding of renewable generation has led to many difficulties for both generators and the grid due to volatile output and market conditions. Battery energy storage systems have begun to alleviate these issues. However, such systems face many financial challenges in their deployment and operation. This paper demonstrates the use of advanced distributed ledger technology with smart contracts to design a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) to manage the investments in these systems and optimise their operations. In this paper, a series of smart contracts have been designed, deployed, and tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of such a DAO framework for battery management. The interconnected smart contracts can manage the financing, governing, and revenue-sharing mechanisms, allowing investors to coordinate investment and vote on the battery energy storage system's operation (charge/float/discharge) for a given period. This interconnected smart contract design implementation demonstrates a novel and effective strategy for managing battery energy storage systems, decreasing barriers to entry for investors, thus, allowing a greater adoption of such technology.},

  abstract={Energy management systems/supervisory control and data acquisition (EMS/SCADA) systems are usually geographically distributed and have operational organizations. They are changing in accordance with the various and varying environments, and they should be flexible enough to adapt to those changes quickly. The paper proposes a new architecture called SCOPE (System Configuration of Power Control System) to realize flexible and reliable EMS/SCADA systems. SCOPE makes application programs independent of the operational organization and system configuration of the EMS/SCADA system, i.e., application programs are not influenced by changes in them. These properties make EMS/SCADA systems flexible and reliable, and also the development of EMS/SCADA systems becomes efficient and economical. Through developing and evaluating a SCOPE prototype system, it has been confirmed that the flexibility and maintainability of EMS/SCADA systems based on the SCOPE architecture has been improved.},

Combining the latest VR/AR related virtual reality technology, the application scenarios are linked to the decentralized servers, which greatly increase the accessibility of Metaverse. By using the blockchain browser to access the dapp, the accessibility of the content is further improved. More virtual worlds can be developed in combination with the actual application scenarios.

In the application of the meta universe, smart contracts enable the economic development of virtual scenes with tokens. As the underlying network structure of the meta universe, the blockchain network is landing at an unprecedented speed. It is developing the meta universe in the network structure logic related to digital wallets, distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs), distributed storage, decentralized public transactions, and heterogeneous authentication (NFT). It has multiple advantages. First, it realizes participation in predictable scenarios and reduces labor consumption. Sec ond, the interaction process realized the alternation of reality and virtual, and increased diversified creation.

  abstract={Emerging healthcare systems are expected to leverage new Internet of Things (IoT) trends to enable preventive and personalized medicine. However, the success of such systems is entirely dependent on the ability to preserve patient privacy. This paper proposes a decentralized ontology based system architecture that caters to a healthcare organization's privacy needs as well as its enterprise security policy concerns considering futuristic IoT and Electronic Health Records (EHR) trends in healthcare. To identify privacy infringements and organizational policy violations across the institution, our proposed HealthCare Security and Privacy (HCSP) ontology is utilized in conjunction with three agent-level filters: the Exception Creation Agent (ECA), the Policy Mapping Agent (PMA), and the Privacy Assurance Filter (PAF). Preliminary evaluation has shown effectiveness of the HCSP ontology in terms of detection of policy compliance to HIPAA standards.},

  pages={517-521},
  abstract={A model of decentralized data storage system is presented to ensure the integrity and availability of information based on decentralized management algorithm. The proposed decentralized management algorithm solves the problem of a rapidly growing IP address table due to the increasing number of system users. We propose an approach focused on optimizing the direct links between the hosts of the storage network and dynamically calculating their ratings. Host ratings are calculated based on network latency, uptime, and processor performance. The rating calculation is a two-stage process, the second stage takes CPU performance into account. This model offers a tiered structure of masterhosts, where first-level masterhosts accumulate host IP addresses and provide access to their database, maintaining the current state of the decentralized storage network, second-level masterhosts aggregate the IP addresses of first-level masterhosts into groups, thus creating a hierarchical network structure. The paper evaluates the proposed approach by calculating the consumed service traffic required to maintain each host, and compares the decentralized storage scheme and the centralized scheme. The results show that the decentralized system is superior to the centralized one in terms of data availability and has a higher efficiency of disk space utilization due to savings on data duplication, which proves the possibility of effective existence of such a system, and thus its application to ensure the integrity and availability of stored data.},

  abstract={Autonomous control technology for multiple network-connected multi-rotors and simultaneous remote control by few operators has applications in disaster investigation. Challenges in constructing such a system include path-planning for multiple multi-rotors. Accurate position estimation methods such as GNSS already exist for outdoor self-positioning; however, no optimal method has been established for the path-planning problem involving multi-rotors in dynamic and complex environments. Herein, in addition to the conventional artificial potential field method, we propose an extended function that introduces a rotational force field, which enables autonomous navigation from a starting point to the target while avoiding obstacles and local minima. Additionally, we realized autonomous decentralized formation control and navigation with multiple multi-rotors. This was achieved by applying a virtual spring-damper model between the multi-rotors based on the relative distance information calculated from global positions obtained by inter multi-rotor communication. To confirm the practicality of our proposed method, we generated a two-dimensional map from the three-dimensional model data of a real urban area and conducted simulations for various multiple multi-rotor applications, successfully demonstrating formation control and navigation in complex environments.},

The core protocol components encompass lending and borrowing managers and a liquidation manager to ensure the timely initiation of liquidations under unfavorable conditions. We also discuss various interest rate models to optimize the protocol's performance. To further advance the project's decentralization and governance, we advocate for establishing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and exploring the potential integration of flash loans functionality.

  number={},
  pages={211-216},
  abstract={Sub-Tenancy Architecture (STA), is an extension of Multi-Tenancy Architecture (MTA), allows tenants to offer services for subtenant developers to customize their applications in the SaaS infrastructure [1]. In a STA system, tenants are autonomous decentralized entities who can create subtenants, and grant their resources (including private services and data) to their subtenants. The isolation and sharing relations between parent-child tenants, sibling tenants or non-related tenants are more complicated than those between tenants in MTA. It is important to keep resource private, and at the same time, allow them to be shared, and support application customizations for tenants. This paper provides a formal definition of a new tenant-based access control model based on Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC) for STA in SaaS. Autonomous Areas (AA) and AA-tree are proposed to describe the autonomy of tenants, including their isolation and sharing relationships. Different resource sharing methods are given out to create and deploy the access control scheme in STA models.},

  abstract={The quantity and diversity of stakeholders in space is increasing and centralised management of their assets is becoming more complex. New technologies in Web3 such as Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) can bridge the communication gap with neutral and automated systems, and distribute currently centralised processes that are inherently decentralised by nature. One of these processes is Satellite-based Emergency Mapping (SEM) for Disaster Response Management (DRM). With automated decision strategies and transparent ledgers, a fairer and more accessible system can be built to handle the increase in stakeholders as well as the increasing number of natural disasters occurring. A DAO also address' the key issue with the current SEM process, such as decreasing the current three days wait, required to produce the necessary processed and analysed data for end users, after the disaster occurs. Moreover, with fleets of satellites belonging to different governmental and private organisations, a specific central authority cannot be identified to manage the process in an efficient and equitable way. The paper discusses the need for a more decentralised and automated system for DRM by presenting evidence of current bottlenecks and lays the foundations of the first DAO for on-orbit assets management and demonstrates which Web3 technologies could further improve SEM in this first phase of charter activation.},

  abstract={High-performance sensors play a crucial role in IoV (Internet of Vehicles) to achieve advanced autonomous driving. Typically, IoV involves extensive data sharing and centralizes data storage, posing significant security challenges for sensors. Although blockchain offers a decentralized platform for data exchange, it can’t guarantee the reliability and trustworthiness of each sensor in IoV. Besides, blockchain primarily focuses on technical aspects and falls short of establishing a comprehensive organizational and operational framework for sensors. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization and Operation) into sensors and propose a new framework for reliable sensor operations in IoV, namely SensorDAO. It utilizes the collaboration of on-chain and off-chain layers to support various scenarios at the application layer. We also provide key technical elements to construct SensorDAO, including distributed storage, intelligent algorithms, governance, and incentive mechanisms.},

  abstract={Tailoring treatment and clinical decision making to a person's unique characteristics is the next milestone for healthcare informatics, but for it to be accomplished, big data analytics for identifying risk factors and other hidden patterns among patients become paramount. In future these analytics will take the form of multicenter observational research, for which data preparation is vital. Specifically, quality data must be obtained in a timely manner while protecting the privacy of patients in the health records shared among researchers. Furthermore, the coordination and cooperation of a fluctuating number of medical data sources containing these records for clinical data distribution is an additional requirement in multicenter studies. Thus, we propose an autonomous decentralized, privacy-enabled data preparation architecture and novel SEDTM algorithm to meet these requirements, censuring sensitive information via filtration, and extracting relevant clinical data with a fully automated approach. Our evaluation demonstrates a 40% - 60% increase in the retrieval of quality patient data, compared to traditional semantic similarity, for our proposed SEDTM algorithm.},

  abstract={The emergence of blockchain technologies, including smart contracts, enables the decentralization of applications that were previously controlled by a single entity. In many cases, however, smart contracts still need to distinguish between different user roles according to their assigned duties. To ensure security, smart contracts often apply a simple form of role-based access control (RBAC), where a dedicated administrator assigns users to roles that are authorized to invoke specific smart contract functions. As this solution contradicts the blockchain principles of decentralization and democratic decision making, smart contracts may also form decentralized autonomous organizations where governance decisions are based on voting by all participants. Many applications would benefit from a hybrid approach that involves roles with different permissions while still allowing for collaborative management. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism for RBAC administration in smart contracts based on hierarchical roles and configurable administration rules for each role. Any change in the user-role relation requires joint approval by members of selected roles according to the associated rule. This enables decentralized organizational charts with flexible administration constraints, where each role corresponds to specific permissions in the decentralized application and any change is transparently and securely recorded on the blockchain. The practical feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by means of a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum blockchain. Several benchmarks are performed to analyze the potential overhead of different solution variants.},

  abstract={Blockchain has become one of the hottest research areas in recent years. The technology could potentially lead to a new generation of decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous organizations. Unfortunately, there is simply too much misinformation regarding blockchain. Most notably, blockchain has been used as a buzzword synonymous with data immutability and trust. In fact, this is far from the truth. In this article, we provide a concise description of exactly what blockchain technology is, including its design principle, building blocks, core innovations, and benefits. This is followed by an analysis of data immutability. We show that to create an insurmountable barrier against attacks on data immutability, decentralization and system scale are both necessary. Based on this analysis, we further dissect what benefits private and consortium blockchain could actually offer when decentralization is removed. We show that private and consortium blockchain cannot offer data immutability and trust as many works in the literature have claimed or implied. Instead, the centralized version of blockchain technology provides an elegant solution to achieving fault tolerance and atomic contract execution, which could make private and consortium blockchain useful for enterprises that would like to provide high availability to their customers and for their internal operations.},

  abstract={The key component in enterprise information framework is the enterprise model that affects many aspects of implementing enterprise information system. In this paper, a new model named P-PROCE model is put forward especially for intranet enterprise. It consists of five sub models: process model, product model, resource model, organization model, cost and evaluation model (P-PROCE). The process model serves as the heart and center of the enterprise model, which decides efficiency, cost and final revenue. Its application is presented in detail after the model is introduced.},

  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Under the social manufacturing context, geographically distributed and decentralized micro-and-small-scale manufacturing enterprises (MSMEs) self-organize into manufacturing communities (MCs), a type of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In MCs, MSMEs share their manufacturing resources for order-driven cross-enterprise production cooperation, which is supported through blockchain-based order tracking. However, the application of blockchain also brings concerns about data security and privacy protection to MSMEs, which leads to disputes between MSMEs about which data should be stored in the blockchain. For this problem, a granular-computing-based data-sharing decision-making (GrC-DSDM) method is proposed. In the GrC-DSDM method, a fuzzy proximity relationship is used to describe the familiarity between MSMEs in the same MC, and MC familiarity is obtained based on the granular space derived from the fuzzy proximity relation. A fuzzy preference relation is used to representMSMEs’ preferences for all metadata related to the order, and a group decision-making method is applied to calculate the preference values for all metadata. Through constructing the mapping relationship between MC familiarity and preference values of all metadata, we can determine which metadata should be shared with the MC for blockchain-based order tracking. The GrC-DSDMmethod can support group decision-making on data sharing among MSMEs in the same MC. The implementation of the GrC-DSDM method is demonstrated through the example of a sheet metal parts processing MC. It is expected that the GrC-DSDMmethod will provide a basis for enabling blockchain-based order tracking inMCs.},

  abstract={Without a doubt the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has been gaining attention over the last years. With the deployment of low cost sensors, a plethora of information is made available, giving rise to intelligent systems that combine data from multiple sources. Multiple IoT platforms have been developed to support different application domains such as smart cities, health, industry 4.0, etc. However, the vertical focus and usually isolated development of such platforms pose difficulties in offering cross-domain smart applications to meet society's needs. To this end, interoperability frameworks have emerged to allow the interplay of different platforms as well as the formation of federations among the entities contributing IoT devices through such platforms. The decentralized nature of IoT data federations presents challenges when it comes to their management and governance, particularly in ensuring fairness, security, trustworthiness and transparency among its members. However, permissioned blockchain-based solutions hold significant potential in addressing these issues due to their inherent characteristics. In this work, we propose a blockchain solution based on the Hyperledger Fabric for the decentralized management of IoT federations and their gover-nance by utilizing voting-based configurable rules that abide to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The solution includes smart contracts for the secure creation and management of federations exposed through APIs, as well as a voting application for enabling the DAO dynamic. Our solution demonstrates a secure, trustworthy and transparent way for the formation and membership control of IoT federations, that holds potential for extension with smart contracts related to data marketplace, as well as reputation and tokenization mechanisms.},

  abstract={The deployment of Industrial IoT Applications are quickly spreading around companies and organizations, mainly involving the use of edge computing. At the same time these applications are improving the production process, they introduces new security concerns that can damage the whole system. Lack of knowledge about security aspects of IoT and designers’ current understanding that security techniques applied to cloud computing or embedded systems in general can be adapted to IoT, constitute the main points of failure. IoT security needs new methods and architectures designed specifically for IoT, not adaptations. In this paper, we propose a new edge security architecture for industrial IoT, that combines the concepts of Blockchain and Context-Aware Security. We present how such technologies can be integrated in order to mitigate the security issues related to IoT environments. The proposed architecture was deployed in an Additive Manufacturing Units use case.},

  abstract={Content moderation is a critical issue for media providers to protect viewers from harmful content and also to build a good reputation with the public. Due to the lack of a trustworthy and effective quality management mechanism for content moderation, the heavy workload of content moderation remains difficult for media providers. In this paper, we propose a decentralized management mechanism for content moderation, in which the permissioned blockchain provides credible, transparent and verifiable infrastructure and the smart contracts ensure the automatic execution of pre-set management rules. The proposed mechanism combines a quality evaluation and monetary incentive method based on authenticity historical data, aiming to achieve long-term sustainable quality improvement. Experimental results show that our mechanism can successfully execute the preset management rules automatically, which can simplify the management complexity and avoid human intervention.},

  abstract={Since the awareness of the availability of Big Data hit the business world in the early 2000s, more and more organizations have switched to data-driven approaches to everything from hiring to product development. Gartner has reported that up to 60 percent of big data projects won't make it into implementation. That means that understanding the need for analytics isn't enough; you need to be able to collect data and put it effectively to work. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) along with its subsets of machine learning and deep learning as powerful methodology and technology for big data projects is plagued by data bias and data quality conundrums. At the same time, there has been discussion over how blockchain could help in tackling these abandoned data projects as well as data reliability concerns, and it turned out that bringing blockchain technologies to big data analytics and creating so-called decentralized intelligence offers serious benefits by providing businesses with greater visibility, security, and efficiency in managing their big data, but also rendering some research questions that we aim to address in this study such as: can agents train a model without needing to disclose their data?, can the third parties contribute to an AI model in an influential way?, at the same time, we expect a reciprocal relationship between decentralized intelligence and Big data analytics which pose questions such as: how effectively decentralized intelligence impacts big data analytics? and how effectively big data analytics impacts decentralized intelligence?},

This paper proposes a unified design model for assurance networks and demonstrates the model, methodology and its application to mobile ad hoc networks. In the unified design model, in order to realize the assurance networks, an overall network is partitioned into sub networks and real-time self-organized control functions are incorporated into each sub network for resilience to dynamic change, faults possibly causing failure and attacks to security. In the application of the proposed unified design model to mobile ad hoc networks, a real-time self-organizing autonomous clustering is presented. The simulation experimental results show that the presented autonomous clustering is resilient to a diversity of node mobility and its variation.},

  abstract={The security problem within cryptocurrencies has high priority since it is published. The news of cryptocurrencies attack is keeping rising, and types of attacks are recorded as the classical security issues such as the most famous one decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) attack and which caused 3.6 million cryptocurrencies stolen. Thus, with the ripe fuzzing technique, using such testing skills on smart contracts to discover more bugs and leaks hidden in cryptocurrencies in a more automatic and intelligent approach could bring huge benefits. This paper is aimed to analyze the variation from the very first smart contract tools to the newest one, to discuss their pros and cons of them. This experiment mainly chose three fuzzing tools, several basic and classic smart contracts as tested material, and recorded the performance of fuzzing contracts of each tool. And the results are clear to show that even the newest fuzzer has a better performance than the other, but it is better to use it depending on the specific requirements while the rest of the two fuzzing tools has some advantages in some aspect. Therefore, this paper could make guidance for the later researcher to use exactly the type of fuzzer they need.},

  abstract={The flexibility and adaptability of smart production systems are achieved through the use of autonomous and collaborating production assets. However, these systems still heavily rely on a central control unit to supervise and coordinate assets, as well as adapt to new demands. Additionally, these systems require reliable wireless connectivity to function effectively. This paper summarizes three contributions to autonomous manufacturing systems. Firstly, a system architecture that co-designs communication control for collaborating production assets is proposed, enabling dynamic trade-off negotiations between the control application and the communication network. Secondly, a novel approach for the self-organization of assets that can adapt in real-time is introduced. Finally, we present a collaborating strategy that facilitates close collaboration between robots while considering the performance of the wireless communication system in use.},

  pages={170-177},
  abstract={Imagine a distributed mediation application consisting of hundreds of thousands of interconnected nodes, collecting data from millions of pervasive sensors, processing data and delivering it to a myriad of business services. This application takes the form of an acyclic, directed graph. Its shape must continually adapt in response to changes in sensor availability, network layout and business objectives. This involves dynamically adding, configuring, migrating and removing graph nodes. A centralised Observer/Controller, or Autonomic Manager (AM), that controls lifecycle operations for the entire graph would neither scale with the system's size and adaptation frequency, nor survive in unpredictable environments. This paper proposes a decentralised solution for enabling mediation applications to self-grow and to self-adapt their shapes and behaviours. In this approach, applications can autonomously grow into instances of a predefined, abstract architectural model and continually adapt to their execution conditions. A proof-of-concept prototype was developed using a Java-based, Service Oriented Component technology - iPOJO / OSGi. Experimental results from a Home Monitoring data-mediation scenario show the applicability and viability of our approach. We believe that the proposed framework will enable applications to autonomously grow and survive in volatile execution environments, over extended time periods.},

  abstract={Self-organization is a key strategy for improving the performance of an aerial swarm ad hoc network. The proliferation of low-cost VTOL drones has broadened the application domain of aerial swarms, and the need for synchronized communication among network entities has become crucial. However, existing ad hoc approaches struggle to maintain multi-hop connections in contested environments characterized by frequent topology changes and intermittent links. To overcome these limitations, we introduced STDMA protocol, which enables the self-configuration of drones without reliance on a ground controller. In continuation of the earlier work, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol. Comparative simulation experiments cover various scenarios with different network sizes, frame lengths, and traffic loads. The STDMA protocol achieves optimal access delay in highly contested environments and reduces delay by approximately 19.181%. Moreover, it exhibits improved channel utilization compared to the E-ASAP/SM protocol, with a 4.5 times increase.},

  abstract={Ride-hailing and ride-sharing applications have recently gained popularity as a convenient alternative to traditional modes of travel. Current research into autonomous vehicles is accelerating rapidly and will soon become a critical component of a ride-hailing platform’s architecture. Implementing an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing platform proves a difficult challenge due to the centralized nature of traditional ride-hailing architectures. In a traditional ride-hailing environment the drivers operate their own personal vehicles so it follows that a fleet of autonomous vehicles would be required for a centralized ride-hailing platform to succeed. Decentralization of the ride-hailing platform would remove a roadblock along the way to an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing platform by allowing owners of autonomous vehicles to add their vehicle to a community-driven fleet when not in use. Blockchain technology is an attractive choice for this decentralized architecture due to its immutability and fault tolerance. This thesis proposes a framework for developing a decentralized ride-hailing architecture that is verifiably secure. This framework is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. The evaluation of the implementation is done by applying known security models, utilizing a static analysis tool, and performing a performance analysis under heavy network load.},

  abstract={The rise of Artificial Intelligence for Science (AI4S) has highlighted the importance and urgency of ensuring open-ness, fairness, impartiality, diversity, and sustainability in scientific systems. Existing scientific systems, referred to as Centralized Science (CeSci), are built on centralized organizational structures and top-down institutional frameworks, which are lagging behind the development and practical requirements of AI4S. To address these limitations, AI4S needs to embrace a new scientific organizational and operational paradigm, namely Decentralized Science (DeSci). It can provide strong support to AI4S via effectively addressing issues such as information silos, biases, unfair distribution, and monopolies and promoting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans disciplinary cooperation in science. Based on these considerations, this paper presents the framework of AI4S based on DeSci and explores its potential application scenarios and research issues. The research can provide effective guidance for the development of scientific systems.},

  abstract={Crypto management is proposed to tackle the management decision-making challenges under data asymmetry and trust asymmetry that cannot be solved merely by technical means. It emphasizes the novel management model for the real-time generation of reliable, trustworthy, and usable management decisions based on blockchain and blockchain-driven technologies. First, the framework model of crypto management with detailed descriptions of each technique is introduced, where blockchain is the underlying technology, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is the management structure, federated data is the decision basis, smart contract is the decision method, and non-fungible token (NFT) is the main decision incentive. Then, its collaboration mechanisms of on-blockchain DAO and off-blockchain organization as well as intra-organization and extra-organization nodes are discussed. Moreover, the potential applications of crypto management are addressed, and a case of task-oriented performance management is given to state how crypto management works to generate the real-time management decisions. Toward the end, the future research directions are pointed out in this emerging new area.},

  abstract={Interoperability in today's healthcare world is big challenge. Although a number of standards have been developed in this domain yet the realization is still a key challenge. Health Level 7 (HL7) is an information exchange standard which formulates specifications for interoperable communication. HL7 V3 uses Messaging Infrastructure (MI) for the communication but it cannot provide flexible communication environment. It is required to have end-to-end sessions and business scenarios from real healthcare environment. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) provides a platform for system development and integration in order to achieve the main goal of interoperability along with flexibility. In HL7 V3, the communication between systems takes place using process artifacts (application roles, interactions, trigger events and information models). SOA based HL7 V3 infrastructure consists of application roles as services that are responsible for the interaction between communicating entities. Our system provides services that have business perspectives in terms of capturing healthcare business workflows. The work in this paper is based on the HL7 V3 specifications and also uses certain guidelines of Healthcare Service Specification Project (HSSP).},

  abstract={Autonomous connected vehicles are revolutionizing the automotive industry vision and impacting their business model. This trend will likely impact other related industries and their business model such as automotive insurance companies, tier-II automotive manufactures, and automotive maintenance service companies. The growing number of connected vehicles will require new policy formulation by the government about privacy and security issues in the era of massive digitalization and automation. Organizations such as 3GPP and IEEE are evolving standards that address security issues for connected vehicles. However, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will play a significant role in 5G networks and beyond, we address the privacy and security issues with a blockchain-based intelligent digital forensics system for autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) in a connected smart world incorporating artificial intelligence. The proposed system includes a novel algorithm for the autonomous connected vehicles and the users' security and privacy. We utilize short randomizable signatures to anonymously authenticate witness's identities and to protect the witnesses' privacy. Then, we leverage fine-grained access control based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for evidence access and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system by simulating the proposed model, its computational costs and communication overhead by implementing a prototype on a local Ethereum blockchain network platform. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed system. We envision the application of the proposed system to ensure security and privacy of ACVs and their security applications for use with 5G-V2X and future XG-V2X networks.},

Today's Air Traffic Management (ATM) system is comprised of a wide variety of application developed for specific purposes, such systems use various custom communication protocols and each system has its own self-contained information system. For this reason, ICAO has proposed the concept of SWIM for effective exchange of information between providers and users, currently the lively research of SWIM is being in progress around United States and Europe. For keeping step with ICAO, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea established the master plan and they have begun the research and the development of SWIM to integrate all aviation information systems by building navigation-based platform and to provide user-oriented navigation and aviation information services. In addition, Korea Airports Corporation was chosen as main research institution, and the development of SWIM test bed will be conducted until 2018 and a system for external services will be established by 2020. In this paper, we will briefly describe the structure of SWIM test bed sysem in progress at KAC, the data logger system of flight information, interface plans of AIXM-based system and WXXM-based system.},

Almost every country in the world have different approaches to that subject. As an example; United States of America and the Europe Union have acclaimed regulations about animal rights. However, the situation in many countries is not that bright for the stray animals. Stray animals face considerable ratios of violence, assault and death. The shelters have conspicuous problems, such as overpopulation, hunger, lack of space, forced mating, illegal euthanasia and death ratio. Those circumstances have put adopting and fostering mechanisms on a much more troublesome way. Our proposal includes a promising, trackable and transparent system solution based on blockchain technology for the animal shelters. Design of the system, requirements and possible usage scenarios have been proposed. The prototype is implemented on Ethereum. Smart contracts are implemented for autonomous work of the system.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={24-32},
  abstract={This research introduces the design and implementation of a universal systematic 2-dimensional terrain marking and coverage solution. Real world applications such as lawn mowing, mine detection, chemical spill clean-up, and humanitarian search and rescue missions can be automated by employing swarms of autonomous mobile robots to complete the task. In most of these real world applications, efficiency is of utmost importance especially when human lives are involved. The solution proposed builds up on two graph traversal algorithms; Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS), where the algorithms are adapted and modified to be utilized for coverage of 2-dimensional isometric grid-like representations of terrains. The solution is developed so that each robot in the swarm would be fully capable of covering and marking any terrain by itself. The efficiency of the solution is optimized by increasing the swarm size, as robots benefit from data sharing in their path planning and self organization within the terrain. Communication between robots enable them to perform on a higher level by benefiting from the collaborative distributed behavior of the swarm as a whole. The communication between particles is decentralized and is carried out at a local level with no need for a central guidance mechanism. Robot abilities in this research are limited, where a robot can see and move only to locations that are adjacent to its current location. A simulation based evaluation is conducted in this research to assess the robots' area coverage and marking performance. The results show that the simulated robot swarm systems are suited for efficient flat area coverage, allowing for redundancy in data collection, and tolerating individual robot errors and shortcomings as the number of robots becomes more abundant.},

The issue of intersection control for these future self-driving vehicles is one of the emerging research issues. Contrary to some of the previous research approaches, this paper is proposing a paradigm shift based upon cooperative self-organizing control framework with end-user responsibility. Distributed vehicle intelligence has been used to calculate each vehicle's approaching velocity. The control mechanism has been developed in an agent-based environment. Self-organizing agent's trajectory adjustment bases upon a proposed priority principle. Testing of the system has proved its safety, user comfort, and efficiency functional requirements. Several recommendations for further research are presented.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology is used often as a merger with other technologies to achieve a high level of security, privacy, and robustness and to handle issues, such as maliciousness of nodes, privacy leakage, the selfishness of nodes, communication delays, and high execution and transaction costs. There is currently a lack of a comprehensive system for automating and cost-effectively managing vehicle repairs, maintenance, and other associated services. To solve such issues, we proposed a novel futuristic comprehensive model that integrates a blockchain-based framework to safely record vehicle maintenance, validate repair services, and oversee parts inventory. It employs smart contracts and consensus protocols to secure communications and data storage, thus reducing data breaches and vulnerabilities from single-point failures. A reward system is embedded within the network to encourage positive behavior and deter detrimental actions. We also incorporated advanced privacy-ensuring methods, like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty computation, to safeguard sensitive data while preserving its utility. Our model features automatic detection and response mechanisms for node failure, improving network resilience by 25% thus also providing a 20% reduction in execution, operational costs, and scalability with an enhancement of 15%, underscoring the model’s efficiency in vehicular repair and maintenance activities. Results and simulations clearly depict the overall performance and efficiency in terms of security, privacy, node failure, and the management of vehicle repairs with respect to other closely related models.},

  abstract={Inspiration in nature has been widely explored, from macro to micro-scale. Natural phenomena mainly considers adaptability, optimization, robustness, organization, among other properties, to deal with complexity. When looking into chemical phenomena, stability and organization are two properties that emerge. Recently, artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN), a supervised learning method inspired in the inner structures and mechanisms of chemical compounds, have been proposed as a data-driven approach in artificial intelligence. AHN have been successfully applied in data-driven approaches, such as: regression and classification models, control systems, signal processing, and robotics. To do so, molecules -the basic units of information in AHN-play an important role in the stability, organization and interpretability of this method. Until now, building the architecture of AHN has been treated as a whole entity; but distributed computing mechanisms, as well as the exploitation of hierarchical organization of molecules, can enhance the performance of AHN. Thus, this paper aims to discuss challenges and trends of artificial hydrocarbon networks as a data-driven method, with emphasis on packaging, distributed computing and hierarchical properties. Throughout this work, it presents a description of the main insights of AHN and the proposed distributed and hierarchical mechanisms in molecules. Potential applications and future trends on AHN are also discussed.},

  pages={71-79},
  abstract={We propose an autonomous group-management model where each node autonomously judges whether to work with other nodes and dynamically forms a group to complete a requested job. This model was developed for mobile systems that consist of mobile terminals and base stations (BSs). The BSs are connected by a network and each BS judges if it should form a group with other BSs based on their physical locations and the type of job without relying on direction from the other BSs. Therefore, each BS is "autonomous". The BSs dynamically form local groups without any centralized manager share information, and complete a job, so this system is well suited to highly distributed systems where high performance is necessary. An intelligent transport system (ITS) is a typical application that matches this model. Various information is provided front BSs to moving cars in an ITS. Such a system will cover a wide area (all of Japan) and will include a huge number of BSs. High performance is required because many cars move at high-speed. We applied our proposed model to a smart gateway (SG) system - one of the ITSs promoted by the Telecommunication Advancement Organization of Japan. We developed a new type of BS according to this model and installed a series of such BSs along roads for our evaluation of the system.},

  abstract={In the past, Quality of Service (QoS) was taken into account to evaluate the performance of multimedia services (e.g., video streaming, file transfer, etc.). However, it cannot reflect the user's perception, which is considered a crucial consideration by these services nowadays. Therefore, the emergence of Quality of Experience (QoE) is a potential solution. QoE can be measured via many parameters provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP), Application Service Providers (ASP), or end-users. However, privacy concerns hinder data sharing between the parties involved. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a QoE estimation mechanism that leverages Federated Learning. This mechanism aims to guarantee data privacy when no party needs to disclose their data to others. Moreover, the proposed mechanism incorporates the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure in the centralized architecture of Federated Learning. It enables all participants to evaluate and select the model efficiently. The experimental results illustrate that the proposal surpasses the centralized solutions and guarantees data privacy.},
