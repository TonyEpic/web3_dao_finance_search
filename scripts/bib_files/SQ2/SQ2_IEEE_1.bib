  abstract={Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their promise of realizing the decentralized Web 3.0. However, most DAOs rely heavily on token-centric value systems as well as allocate decision-making authority and yield-sharing rights according to the held tokens, which often lead to monopolization of power and rights. To address this issue, this paper contributes to propose a truly democratic organization model, named True Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), that does not count upon tokens and is guided by principles of contribution-based and on-demand allocation. We first discuss the design of TAOs, including their infrastructures, power structures, and value systems, and then provide a technical roadmap for implementing TAOs in the DeSci context. This research can provide a valuable guidance for the construction and application of TAOs.},

  abstract={The governance technology of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provides an effective solution for solving existing organizational management issues. Governance mechanisms of DAOs are usually encoded in smart contracts in the form of rule sets and executed automatically. However, the mechanism’s logical flaws and code errors expose DAOs to unpredictable risks. Complex adaptive dynamics computer-aided design (CadCAD) can test the effectiveness of the mechanisms through simulation. Nonetheless, as DAOs are typical complex systems with social and engineering complexity, managing, controlling, and supervising their operation through traditional methods are difficult. The parallel intelligence theory based on artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method provides an effective research framework and practical method for solving DAOs’ governance issues. Therefore, in this article, we propose a parallel mechanism verification method and execution system, namely, complex adaptive systems for computer-aided dynamic design (casCAD2) as an extension of cadCAD. Leveraging parallel intelligence and cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS), casCAD2 is capable of probing into the laws that govern system evolution within a simulated environment. It serves as a robust tool for verifying the efficacy of DAOs’ mechanisms and predicting their potential risks. We also build a parallel market-based anchoring mechanism (MAM) system to demonstrate how it can be used for DAOs’ mechanism verification. This study can provide a new research method and application system for DAOs’ effective governance.},

  abstract={Decentralized autonomy is a long-standing research topic in information sciences and social sciences. The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

To address the gap, this work presents a primary investigation of DAOs (35+). We category, examine and evaluate existing DAOs regarding their operational features, (non-)functionalities and real-world performance. In addition, we provide a consolidated exploration of DAOs by conducting a literature review [1] and an empirical study on mainstream projects, particularly Snapshot [2].

DAO(Decentralized autonomous organization) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts are regarded as effective methods to solve the organizational governance problems for complex systems. Therefore, this article analyzes the main issues currently faced by ITS. Then, this paper proposed a 6-layer DAO structure framework for ITS and discussed its key research issues. Finally, a case study for the Macau transportation system is carried out, and further research directions are proposed. The DAO-based transportation system will represent the future trend of ITS development.

  abstract={Decentralized science (DeSci) is a hot topic emerging with the development of Web3 or Web3.0 and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and operations. DeSci fundamentally differs from the centralized science (CeSci) and Open Science (OS) movement built in the centralized way with centralized protocols. It changes the basic structure and legacy norms of current scientific systems via reshaping the cooperation mode, value system, and incentive mechanism. As such, it can provide a viable path for solving bottleneck problems in the development of science, such as oligarchy, silos, and so on, and make science more fair, free, responsible, and sensitive. However, DeSci itself still faces many challenges, including scaling, balancing the quality of participants, system suboptimal loops, lack of accountability mechanism, and so on. Taking these into consideration, this article presents a systematic introduction of DeSci, proposes a novel reference model with a six-layer architecture, addresses the potential applications, and also outlines the key research directions in this emerging field. This article is committed to providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts on DeSci.},

  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organizations(DAOs) enabled by blockchain and smart contracts is regarded as an effective tool to solve corporate governance problems. It can minimize the contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, and other issues in corporate governance. However, DAOs also face a variety of governance issues, such as internal governance issues and external governance issues caused by the technical attributes of blockchain and smart contracts. DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions. We consider that parallel governance represents the future trend of DAO research and practice. This paper is aimed at stimulating further effort and providing helpful guidance and reference for future research works.},

  abstract={The advent of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous innovations in online governance, with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) emerging as a prominent development, often referred to as “digital jurisdictions.” Despite experiencing remarkable growth, currently boasting nearly 7M users and   ${\$}$  18 billion in assets, DAOs remain relatively underexplored in the existing literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

  pages={1370-1380},
  abstract={The attention is a scarce resource in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), as their self-governance relies heavily on the attention-intensive decision-making process of “proposal and voting”. To prevent the negative effects of proposers' attention-capturing strategies that contribute to the “tragedy of the commons” and ensure an efficient distribution of attention among multiple proposals, it is necessary to establish a market-driven allocation scheme for DAOs' attention. First, the Harberger tax-based attention markets are designed to facilitate its allocation via continuous and automated trading, where the individualized Harberger tax rate (HTR) determined by the proposers' reputation is adopted. Then, the Stackelberg game model is formulated in these markets, casting attention to owners in the role of leaders and other competitive proposers as followers. Its equilibrium trading strategies are also discussed to unravel the intricate dynamics of attention pricing. Moreover, utilizing the single-round Stackelberg game as an illustrative example, the existence of Nash equilibrium trading strategies is demonstrated. Finally, the impact of individualized HTR on trading strategies is investigated, and results suggest that it has a negative correlation with leaders' self-accessed prices and ownership duration, but its effect on their revenues varies under different conditions. This study is expected to provide valuable insights into leveraging attention resources to improve DAOs' governance and decision-making process.},

The parallel architecture on M2OS is proposed, including the parallel interactive actual M2OS and artificial M2OS. Among them, the artificial M2OSs provide digital infrastructures for organizations to operate, collaborate, and make decisions in the virtual space, and conduct computational experiments to evaluate management decisions and predict future states of the actual M2OS. Through parallel execution and closed-loop feedback between the artificial and actual M2OSs, the management and control, experimentation and evaluation, as well as learning and training of the actual M2OS can be realized. Moreover, the functional layers of M2OS, including the infrastructure layer, data layer, scenario layer, modeling layer, decision layer, and application layer, are discussed. These layers work together to support the intelligent, autonomous, collaborative, and adaptive nature of the M2OS, and facilitate data-driven decision-making, optimize business operations, and empower managers with real-time actionable insights. The proposed M2OS paradigm has great potential to transform the management paradigm and opens up new possibilities for intelligent and collaborative decision-making.},

  abstract={The potential of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to reduce on-board system costs in autonomous vehicles through shared intelligence is considerable. However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.},

This research aims to fill these knowledge gaps by examining the unique thematic priorities of various decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), providing insights into their functions, and elucidating their involvement in investment, community, technological, and monetary issues. Through the utilization of experimental research, this research provides DAO stakeholders with the ability to make wellinformed judgements, prioritize ideas, and customize methods in order to more effectively match with their distinct missions and objectives.

  abstract={With the development of intelligent transportation technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) faces challenges such as data silos, security and privacy concerns, data quality issues, and collaboration barriers. To address the various challenges, this paper proposes an innovative integration scheme called the IoV Data Management System (IDMS). This system is built upon blockchain and parallel intelligence technologies, aiming to solve the challenges presented in the IoV domain. The proposed system uses the decentralized, immutable and traceable characteristics of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanism and collaboration model of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), to build a secure and trusted data sharing platform to solve data problems in IoV. This research combines parallel intelligence, blockchain and DAO technologies to provide an innovative framework for IoV information management. The proposed framework enables parallel management of connected vehicle systems, thereby improving safety, reliability and efficiency.

  abstract={Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is believed to play a significant role in our future society governed in a decentralized way. In this article, we first explain the definitions and preliminaries of DAO. Then, we conduct a literature review of the existing studies of DAO published in the recent few years. Through the literature review, we find out that a comprehensive survey towards the state-of-the-art studies of DAO is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform such an overview by identifying and classifying the most valuable proposals and perspectives closely related to the combination of DAO and blockchain technologies. We anticipate that this survey can help researchers, engineers, and educators acknowledge the cutting-edge development of blockchain-related DAO technologies.},

Our paper implements and demonstrates a solution to this issue by introducing a quasi DAO (qDAO) that allows for centralized decision-making when necessary. By modifying smart contracts and introducing new rules, we strike a balance between decentralization and centralized management, offering potential opportunities for improved crisis management in DAOs. We present a demo of our qDAO implementation on the local Ethereum testnet, along with a web application for user input.

  abstract={Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have emerged as an interesting new category of software application. Initial applications are disrupting the finance industry, but the technology is not restricted to fintech applications or assets. While other devices or software applications also claim to be autonomous, in many cases there have been levels proposed to scale or categorize the degree of autonomy afforded those applications. This notion of a level of autonomy is particularly important for consumer awareness as these autonomous devices and applications scale out to mass-market services. The societal impact from the operationalization of these technologies can be significant in terms of safety, security, privacy, and the consequences of failures. This article develops a proposed measure of autonomy for DAOs based on the existing legal/financial concept of liabilities.},

  abstract={Blockchain is a new type of decentralized technology, causing more and more attention because of the huge number of implicit revolutionary applications in many fields, especially in the finance field. The DAO was a crowdfunding project based on blockchain. It was one of the most widely-known blockchain applications in 2016, not only because of the most amount of crowdfunded money (i.e., ETH tokens) so far, in a very short period, but also due to the attack event. In this paper, a brief introduction of The DAO attack event is presented. We also present an acute analysis of the result that “the hacker stole large quantity of money from The DAO”, as well as the analysis of the suggested solution that “the wallet address of the hacker should be frozen” to the event given by The DAO community. Accordingly, two logical paradoxes are formulated on the event results and the proposed solution. Finally, The DAO paradoxes are formally described, analyzed, and proved in propositional logic.},

  abstract={Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.},

  abstract={In this paper, we analyze the current management status of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and propose a protocol for managing a DAO. For the management of this form of organization, decentralization and autonomy are particularly critical. This basic premise avoids the potential abuse of power by centralized authority because such a firm is governed by code. In centralized firms, company members have a stronger right to participate in decisions made by high-ranking administrators. Blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized form of indestructible data storage, has gained much attention in recent years. Smart contracts, executable code stored in a blockchain, are based on this concept. We propose an approach to building DAO using smart contracts based on blockchain technology, which provides the optimum conditions for the decentralization and autonomy of DAO. The results show that our proposal outperforms existing solutions in terms of team autonomy within the DAO, the ability of all company members to vote on proposals, and the members elected by the rest of the company for higher positions within the organization. The key benefit of our solution is the universal concept of DAO as a service for any firm with a team-based management approach. This platform may be used by many businesses and also provides extensive access rights control based on predefined rules.},

  abstract={Research related to digital assets & ownership is currently rising along with the escalation utilization of Blockchain through various use cases and its derevatives, for example in facilitating Digital Assets in the form of virtual property (virtual houses / buildings and virtual land) in the Metaverse. These digital assets often have utilities, features, and even limited copies of quantities so that these digital objects have more value for specific users on a platform and even general people who are interested in and value them. To be able to preserve the value of digital assets in the Metaverse such as virtual property previously mentioned especially for transactions, a set of regulations/governance, as well as sustainable development in the future in the Metaverse is really needed so that the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in the metaverse is one way to maintain the sustainability of the ecosystem & market and its potential of virtual property. After conducting research for DAO development for virtual property transactions, starting with determining goals & purposes, breaking down the DAO focus object (virtual property), clustering relevant attributes, matching socio-economic impacts, and finally designing smart contracts & governance consensus, we obtained 4 main layers namely Consensus Governance, Smart Contract, Virtual Property & Socio-Economic.},

  abstract={Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology relies on wireless communication and coordination, aiming to improve road safety and traffic efficiency by orchestrating the interaction among the vehicles, infrastructures, and various entities. However, existing organizational and operational forms of V2X infrastructures encounter significant challenges, such as the capability to guarantee communication security, privacy, and efficiency especially when a centralized management system is used. The emerging Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations (DAOs) present a solution to these challenges. DAOs embed managerial and operational protocols within a blockchain via smart contracts, facilitating smooth and efficient management of organizations without the necessity for centralized oversight. This letter introduces DAOs into the coordination of V2X infrastructures. Through a tripartite functional architecture including organization, coordination, and execution, we can achieve intelligent collaborative management among road infrastructures and vehicles. The DAO-secured V2X infrastructures are anticipated to augment the safety and efficiency of vehicular management in complex road scenarios, holding applicable potential for developing the intelligent roadways of tomorrow.},

  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Blockchain has facilitated the emergence of automation and decentralization concepts, leading to significant organizational and operational changes in businesses, e.g., decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In DAOs, management decisions are made collectively and automatically through smart contracts without a central authority, which results in increased cybersecurity requirements. While blockchain integration aims to eliminate single points of failure and enhance data integrity, DAOs remain susceptible to vulnerabilities in consensus mechanisms, key management, and software management, highlighting the need for intrusion detection. Collaborative intrusion detection has been identified as a potential solution to address emerging cyberattacks in a decentralized environment; however, it is not yet fully developed. This study proposes a federated adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (FANFIS) for collaborative intrusion detection in blockchain–Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. The FANFIS maintains a global intrusion detection model in a privacy-preserving manner over the network. Through computational experiments with datasets of KDDCUP99 and Bot-IoT, we found that using the FANFIS reduced the computational time for model training by an average of 49.42% while maintaining a high-performance level. The superior performance of the FANFIS, as demonstrated by its accuracy, precision, and F1-score, surpasses the conventional method involving data centralization, exhibiting mean percentage errors of 1.4092%, 2.6935%, and 1.3463%, respectively.},

  pages={118-125},
  abstract={Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

The discrete iterative mapping mathematical model of buck converter under pulse width modulation strategy is established. In order to suppress the strong random bifurcation phenomenon, the sliding film variable structure control strategy is introduced, and the traditional proportional integral vector control is replaced. In order to optimize the dynamic response of the system and improve the waveform quality of the system, an adaptive hysteresis channel is introduced to form an improved sliding-film variable structure control. Based on MATLAB / Simulink simulation platform, the physical topology simulation model of buck buck converter is built. The results show that the improved converter system under sliding-film variable structure control not only has the ability to suppress the disturbance rejection of bifurcation behavior, but also can make the system output high-quality electric energy with good waveform quality.},

  abstract={The association of machine learning into medical data and healthcare communities embraces substantial improvement in both health care and machine learning itself. Many companies are racing to integrate machine learning into medical diagnosis process that boosts the automatic medical decision, reducing the inferior effects of data overload and increasing the accurate prediction and time effectiveness. It is one of today's most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection between health care and computer science in general. Thus, there is an urgent need to optimize medical processes, guidelines and workflows to increase the workload capacity while reducing costs and improving efficiencies. Moreover, no medical doctor or experts can manually keep pace today due to increasingly large and complex datasets. In this paper, the authors aim at addressing the mentioned issue by proposing a workflow of medical diagnosis through the lens of the machine learning perspective.

  abstract={Reading and writing data to and from data storage has long been a bottleneck for high performance computing (HPC). The hardware used for data storage exhibits performance that is generally at least an order of magnitude lower than that of volatile memory or processing hardware. Applications often limit the amount of I/O undertaken on HPC systems to reduce this cost, but recently there has been a rise in application categories where ingestion or production of large amounts of data is common, machine learning being an obvious example. As HPC systems increase in size, reaching Exascale levels and beyond, and a subset of applications require ever larger amounts of I/O bandwidth or metadata performance, there is a significant challenge to improve the performance of the data storage technologies employed for I/O operations.},

  abstract={The new generation of digital intelligence technology enables knowledge creation, dissemination, and application to undergoing parallel changes. Scientific systems face an increasingly uncertain, diverse, and complex environment, making adopting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches to research issues inevitable. Existing scientific systems follow linear value streams, leading to problems, such as inefficiency, unfairness, and knowledge monopoly. Decentralized science (DeSci) is a new scientific development paradigm based on Web3, Metaverses, and decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs) technologies, that can solve organizational and management problems in scientific systems through organizing, coordinating, and executing techniques. However, new economic theories and methods are still needed to effectively solve the problem of linear value flow in scientific systems. Metaeconomics based on the parallel intelligence theory, also known as decentralized economics (DeEco), provides a new approach and idea for redesigning the economic system of scientific markets.

  abstract={Blockchain is an emerging technology that finds applications across various industries by providing secure transaction records that cannot be tampered with. It operates as a decentralized and open ledger, offering additional benefits such as traceability and immutability, which greatly contribute to its desirability. Two important blockchain applications include Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) Marketplaces and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). NFTs are unique digital assets like artwork or music that can be bought and sold using cryptocurrency, ensuring both security and efficiency. On the other hand, DAOs are transparent organizations that make decentralized decisions. In our work, we have developed an integrated NFT marketplace and DAO that leverages NFT ownership to determine the weights of choices. The implementation is based on Ethereum ERC-721 tokens. However, the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm used in Ethereum 2.0 lacks fairness. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Delegated Reputation-based Proof of Elapsed Time consensus algorithm (DRPoET). Evaluations conducted on an Ethereum testbed demonstrate that our integrated DAO benefits from fair weights and improved transaction latency and fairness compared to the POS algorithm.},

  abstract={Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) run on resource-constrained devices and play a key role in many Industrial Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems based applications. But, achieving an energy-efficient routing in LLNs is a major challenge nowadays. This challenge is addressed by Routing Protocol for Low-power Lossy Networks (RPL), which is specified in RFC 6550 as a “Proposed Standard” at present. In RPL, a client node uses Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) control messages to pass on the destination information towards the root node. An attacker may exploit the DAO sending mechanism of RPL to perform a DAO Insider attack in LLNs. In this paper, it is shown that an aggressive attacker can drastically degrade the network performance. To address DAO Insider attack, a lightweight defense solution is proposed. The proposed solution uses an early blacklisting strategy to significantly mitigate the attack and restore RPL performance. The proposed solution is implemented and tested on Cooja Simulator.},

  abstract={Construct a Knowledge Graph based on the characteristics of Dao Yin Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine to facilitate users in querying, learning, and disseminating the culture of health maintenance in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and to enhance their health literacy. Using the Bert-CRF model, with manual proofreading, we conducted named entity recognition on literature related to Dao Yin practice, established relationships between entities based on the characteristics of the subject and built a Knowledge Graph for Dao Yin Science using Neo4j. Incorporating 3152 relevant documents, the constructed knowledge graph contains 2262 entity nodes, 5108 relationship data, 7 types of entity attribute categories, and 7 types of relationships. The knowledge graph can be searched using the Cypher query language of Neo4j. This Knowledge Graph visualizes the knowledge of Dao Yin Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine and can be employed to build applications and web platforms for knowledge retrieval, intelligent question answering, and exercise recommendation. It holds practical value for developing related artificial intelligence devices and fostering innovation in the fields of computer science and automation. Moreover, it can be utilized for in-depth data mining and uncovering new research directions.},

  abstract={The open Source Software (OSS) became the backbone of the most heavily used technologies, including operating systems, cloud computing, AI, Blockchain, Bigdata Systems, IoT, and many more. Although the OSS individual contributors are the primary power for developing the OSS projects, they do not contribute to the OSS project's decisionmaking as much as their contributions in the OSS Projects development. This paper proposes a framework to democratize the OSS Project's decision-making using a blockchain-related technology called Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Using DAO, contributors get incentive tokens as a reward in return for contributions. The earned tokens can be used in the process of decision-making governance. This governance model tends to allow OSS individual contributors to have a public voice in the OSS project's development roadmap in particular, and the OSS decision making governance in general.},

  abstract={The development of smart cities has been a significant trend in recent years, aiming to improve the quality of life of citizens by leveraging technology and data. However, the current models of smart cities have limitations in terms of their centralized control and lack of citizen participation. City 5.0 proposes a new paradigm for smart cities that emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between humans and technology. This article presents the concept of Spatial Symbiotic Intelligence, which refers to the ability of a city to dynamically respond to the needs of its citizens and environment through the integration of data from various sources and the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and parallel systems. This letter also discusses the potential benefits and challenges of implementing City 5.0 and highlights some of the ongoing initiatives in this area.},

  abstract={In response to concerns over the centralization tendency in the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), TRUE autonomous organizations and operations (TAOs or TRUE DAOs) have been proposed recently. TAOs aim at spreading equitable value distribution and democratized decision-making, distinguishing them from their DAOs counterparts. This study focuses on the treasury within TAOs, which acts as a central fund pool and a crucial element in the decentralized economy (DeEco) system. First, against a backdrop of potential black swan events and other long-tail unforeseen challenges, a reference model for the intelligent treasury management of TAOs is proposed. Then, an evaluation system, namely VALID, is presented with metrics including verifiability, anti-volatility, legitimacy, inclusiveness, and decentralization. Furthermore, a novel parallel treasury management mechanism is proposed to demonstrate a virtual-real interactive closed-loop management and control paradigm of the treasury, thereby fostering the formulation and development of DeEco. This research provides a comprehensive perspective on intelligent treasury management of TAOs and their role in sustainable advancement of DeEco.},

  pages={1-14},
  abstract={The aim of this study is to examine the efficiency of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) derived from differences in corporate governance structures and transaction costs compared to traditional organizations. Core assumptions on these differences from academic and grey literature are integrated into a model of the governance layers of the innovative socio-technical arrangement that is a DAO. We test this model against the case of “The DAO”, an early experiment in decentralized autonomous organization, which was forced to be stopped after a hacker stole around 50 Million USD in ETH tokens in 2016. The case history and its effects on actors in and outside “The DAO” highlight important aspects to be considered in judging the efficiency of governance structures of DAOs and related transaction costs. Results indicate that especially in situations of crisis, transaction costs rise again and that people are not as far at the margins of the corporate governance as the concept of a DAO proposes.},

  abstract={In order to study the vibration characteristics of transformer core fault on the environment of the offshore atmosphere, a three-dimensional transient model is established by taking SC9-100/10 dry-type transformer as the object and using COMSOL. Conduct electric-magnetic-solid multi-physical field coupling. The influence of core loosening and multi-point grounding on the vibration of transformer core is explored. The results show that: 1) The vibration intensity of the transformer is negatively correlated with the compaction of the iron core. Vibration signal fundamental frequency amplitude increases The amplitude of the fundamental frequency of the vibration signal, that is, the frequency component of 100 Hz increases, and the content of higher harmonics (greater than 100 Hz) increases. 2) When a multi-point ground fault occurs, The acceleration amplitude of transformer core decreases. The simulation of transformer core faults by COMSOL is reasonable and accurate. The vibration characteristics of transformer core are related to its state. Different types of transformer core faults can be differentiated by analyzing vibration characteristics. The calculation methods used in the process of transformer core vibration characteristics and the relevant conclusions obtained from simulation have further guiding significance for predicting transformer core vibration and improving transformer core structure design.},

  abstract={With the rise of Internet of Things, end-users expect to obtain data from well-connected smart sensors and stations. Wearables are lightweight devices that rely on such a data-driven communication to keep people connected for specific purposes (e.g., fire-fighting, health check-up). The state machine of the wearable as a whole is governed by business rules and application logic in the said enterprise context. At a finer level of granularity, the states represented for these wearables could be further refined into the data values of the Internet of Things objects involved. In this paper, we propose an approach to monitoring the states of these objects against the said enterprise rules and the algorithmic logic that are logically expressed in a lightweight, declarative language called Alloy. Our monitoring machinery would detect any abnormal situation where the application logic of the said wearable is violated, allowing an external entity (e.g., a supervising robot, a software agent, a smart device) to step in to take action in due course. We illustrate our techniques using a case-study that describes an Internet of Things solution given to a fast-food restaurant.},

This facilitates a decentralized DAO framework where intelligent agents, guided by parallel triplets data, make real-time production decisions and optimize resource allocation, leading to dynamic, collaborative, and autonomous manufacturing. Our empirical research demonstrates the success of this approach, achieving enhanced production efficiency, reduced defect rates, and empowered worker autonomy.

By using the blockchain browser to access the dapp, the accessibility of the content is further improved. More virtual worlds can be developed in combination with the actual application scenarios. Users can closely participate in the re development of the scenarios to achieve user centered essential services. In the application of the meta universe, smart contracts enable the economic development of virtual scenes with tokens. As the underlying network structure of the meta universe, the blockchain network is landing at an unprecedented speed. It is developing the meta universe in the network structure logic related to digital wallets, distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs), distributed storage, decentralized public transactions, and heterogeneous authentication (NFT). It has multiple advantages. First, it realizes participation in predictable scenarios and reduces labor consumption. Sec ond, the interaction process realized the alternation of reality and virtual, and increased diversified creation. Third, use device terminals and mobile terminals to access applications, accelerate point-to-point interaction, and achieve decentralized services.},

  abstract={A test structure methodology for digital CMOS ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that can be used to evaluate the hardness of various ASIC libraries and processes is described. The method identifies categories of ASIC cells and uses a select set of worst-case test structures to obtain the parameters necessary to evaluate a library and process, and make a tractable, bounded estimate of the expected chip hardness. In addition, if the error rates prove to be excessive, this method helps identify the cells in which hardening efforts will be most productive. This approach minimizes the number of test structures required by categorizing ASIC library cells according to their SEU (single event upset) response and designing a structure to characterize each response for each category. These methods are being applied in the development of ASIC options for hardened chip design and have already been used to design an SEU hardened ASIC controller.<>},

  year={2021},
  volume={15},
  number={4},
  pages={5098-5106},
  abstract={The mobile users offload the application to nearby cloudlet servers instead of the remote cloud for better end-user experience. Each cloudlet is able to process real-time applications with the help of virtual machines (VM). While multiple applications running on the cloudlet, the possibility of overprovisioning issue is unavoidable due to massive task-offloading requests from mobile devices. In this regard, balancing the load, among the cloudlets in a high-interactive applications scenario, is a promising issue. In order to balance the cloudlet load, migration of VMs from an overloaded cloudlet to an underloaded cloudlet is a favored solution. During this process, a well-designed migration mechanism must be outlined that can perform two steps such as VM selection and cloudlet adaption. In this article, an application-aware cloudlet adaption and VM selection framework has been devised for balancing the load in a multicloudlet environment. The candidate-cloudlet adaption is based on a migration efficiency indicator that reduces the response time and enhances load-balancing rate. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework has been evaluated by comparing with other state-of-the-art cloudlet-selection strategies.},

  pages={23687-23699},
  abstract={A smart contract is known to be useful for automating business processes triggered by specific events caused by IoT sensors, data feeds, or other applications. A blockchain-based smart contract management system is an innovative technology that is foreseen to automate future business-to-business (B2B) processes. Blockchain is well-known to play a central role in business process re-engineering by optimizing business workflow operations, especially in multi-party arrangements. This paper presents a multi-organizational smart contract management system in which a user can create, deploy, and execute smart contracts. This paper consists of two parts; in the first part, we have compared existing smart contract management systems based on different characteristics that can play a vital role in selecting a particular system for a specific business need. In the second part, while utilizing and building upon the state-of-the-art techniques, we have built a framework for a blockchain-based smart contract and transaction management system. It is a unified architecture supporting DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and organizational level blockchain-based smart contract execution. There are two types of separate blockchains utilized in the proposed framework, i.e., SBlockchain and TBlockchain. SBlockchain is used to store smart contracts, whereas all the data generated by the smart contracts is stored inside the TBlockchain. In addition, each smart contract has some terms and clauses necessary for some event execution. Various components of the framework and their implementation have been described in detail with the help of relevant use-cases.},

Riding on its tailcoats, we want to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) headed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). In a world where human error is majorly becoming the sole reason for mistakes, as small as a missed medication to huge ones like Chernobyl, it is becoming increasingly important to automate as many actions as possible. Creating automated organizations is only but a first step towards the goal. We decided to make an art organization which sells art to make money. The standard way of doing that would be to create a web platform like Amazon (controlled by humans) that sells art and let human artists upload their artwork. But in the interest of keeping this as automated as possible; we have decided to make a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which generates art. Our organization will sell this art created by the GAN and use the revenues to pay for its resources. An AI will be heading it. Hence the DAO will be an entirely human less organization capable of sustaining itself.},

  abstract={Structured data analysis has historically achieved remarkable success. However, the analysis of massive amounts of unstructured video data is still a challenging problem. Over one billion people use YouTube, a Google corporation, which generates billions of views. YouTube data is being created in extremely large quantities, and with a massive demand to store, analyze, and carefully study large amounts of data to make it usable for big data analytics. For the analysis of these YouTube data, the absence of YouTube Shorts which has become a current trend is the limitation. To address this limitation, YouTube Shorts along with traditional duration videos have been considered for analysis in this work. For analyzing these data, various Machine Learning (ML) techniques like clustering and classification have been considered to categorize the content creators into three different categories such as highly rated, moderately rated and lowly rated. These ratings for recommendation assist content creators in enhancing the value of their brand and the users are benefited by consuming, exchanging shares and promoting the content. The results observed show that the accuracy of the Random Forrest and Gradient Boosting classifiers have equivalent performance i.e., around 98% which are suitable for the above recommendation system. Hence, the objective to encourage investors and fans to become active stakeholders and owners of the creator’s micro-economy is addressed in this paper.},

  abstract={E-government system has greatly improved the efficiency and transparency of daily operations of a government. However, most of existing e-government services are provided in a centralized manner and heavily rely on human individuals to control. The highly centralized IT infrastructure is more vulnerable to outside attacks. Also, it is relatively easy to compromise the data integrity by inside rogue users. Furthermore, relying on individuals to monitor and control some of the working flows makes the system error-prone and leaves room for corruption. To address these challenges, we propose to use the blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to improve the e-government system. The blockchain-based DAO system works in a fully decentralized way and is immune to both outside and inside attacks. At the same time, operations of such system is only controlled by pre-defined rules; thus, the uncertainty and errors caused by human processes are greatly reduced. We provide a concrete use case to demonstrate the usage of DAO e-government and evaluate its effectiveness.},

  abstract={One of the distinguishing features of blockchain-based Distributed Autonomous Organizations(DAO) is lack of a central authority. Changes to blockchain data is achieved through consensus amongst blockchain network participants, rather than through a central node's authoritative decision. Similarly, governance, i.e., changes to features and underlying source code, is achieved through a decentralized mechanism. As adoption of blockchain has increased, the need to evolve and adopt new features has grown. These changes highlight the mechanism by which the network, rather than a central node, makes decisions. One change in particular, proposed increases to the block size to address scalability limitations, has been particularly demonstrative of the governance mechanisms employed by disparate blockchains. For example, two digital currency projects, Bitcoin and Dash, employ significantly different governance mechanisms: the Dash Decentralized Governance By Blockchain (DGBB) process, and the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) process, to decide what changes to make to their blockchains. Dash governance was able to decide to alter the block size in a matter of hours, while Bitcoin governance took several years to make the same decision. This paper evaluates the governance mechanisms of blockchain projects using the change in block size as an exemplar. Two prominent governance mechanisms are described, compared, and assessed based upon how effective they came to consensus and made the decision to change to support the disparate needs of stakeholders.},

The prototype with dimensions of 0.97λmin × 0.97λmin × 0.078λmin (λmin is the free-space wavelength referring to the lowest operational frequency) achieves a 10 dB return loss bandwidth of 28.4% (2.93-3.90 GHz) and an interport isolation of >43 dB. The far-field measurements indicate that the antenna exhibits broadside radiation with a realized gain of >8.0 dBi and low cross-polarization level of <; -30 dB within the wide operational bandwidth.},

  abstract={The study discusses challenges in deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and introduces a solution called Adaptive Offloading Point (AOP) for Federated Learning (FL) in Edge AI. AOP accelerates local training on resource-constrained devices and uses reinforcement learning-based clustering (RL) to determine which deep neural network (DNN) layers to offload to the server. Test results show that, in the VIT transformer model, AOP significantly reduces training time compared to classical FL and the baseline method called FedAdapt, making it a promising solution for Edge AI applications.},

  abstract={SMS is widely used as a daily communication service among people around the world. As such, SMS is a suitable means that can be readily exploited for transferring secret messages between individuals in a less conspicuous way. In this paper, we present an investigation on the suitability of hiding secret message in SMS. The hidden data are represented as lingoes and emoticons which are frequently used by users in SMS and chat. As a result, a pre-shared list, which is common between the sender and receiver is used to embed, and later extract the secret message in SMS in a natural form. The proposed method is implemented and tested on Android based mobile device, and showed some desirable outcomes.},

  abstract={A new smooth switching control method is proposed for the four-tank coupled liquid level system, which solves the problems of serious chattering in sliding mode and slow transient response in backstepping control. Firstly, based on the four-tank system, the non-singular terminal sliding mode controller and backstepping controller are designed respectively. Secondly, the smooth switching function is designed and the two controllers are combined to realize the smooth switching control strategy. Finally, Matlab/Simulink is used to verify the designed smooth switching control strategy. The simulation results show that the smooth switching control strategy effectively combines the advantages of the non-singular terminal sliding mode control method and the backstepping control method, which have the advantages of fast dynamic response and stable and accurate steady-state response. Therefore, the control method has good control performance and practical application prospect.},

This new architecture is aimed to build a kind of low-cost intrusion-free network computer and reduce vulnerability of Neumann model. It is comprised of one CPU and two physically isolated system buses, secure and non-secure. Only non-secure bus has Internet interfaces. Devices, storing private data, can only be accessed through secure bus. Internet related applications, only running on the non-secure bus, have no opportunity to access resources on the secure bus. Besides, only one CPU can efficiently control the cost. To control the connection between CPU and two system buses, and ensure only one bus can be connected to CPU at the same time, a Bus Bridge (BB) is designed.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a compact circularly-polarized (CP) Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) cavity antenna for 5G application operating in 28 GHz band. The antenna consists of a patch with perpendicular-arrows-shaped on a SIW structure. Longitudinal slot etched on the SIW top metallic surface are also used to excite the radiator. The CP radiation is obtained by using a three-quarters-circle-shape loop structure, which make a 90° phase difference between two perpendicular arrows of the radiator. The low profile, light weight antenna offers both left and right hand circular polarization. The final design, with an overall size of 11 mm × 11 mm × 2.16 mm (λo × λo × 0.2λo at the 28 GHz frequency) yields a |S11| < −10 dB bandwidth of 25.200–28.375 GHz (3.175 GHz) and 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 27.466–29.200 GHz (1.734 GHz).

Despite being the first project in this ecosystem, The DAO encountered a significant exploit due to inadequate implementation; nevertheless, it still paved the way for future projects. While decentralized autonomous organizations continue to thrive, there is a shortage of academic papers analyzing the associated risks. Therefore, this paper aims to comprehensively examine the current vulnerabilities in these organizations by systematically analyzing past attack incidents. 54 real-world events spanning from 2016 to July 2023 have been collected for identifying and summarizing major attack vectors. The results showcase that flash loan attacks, oracle manipulation, governance takeovers, and reentrancy issues are the critical vulnerabilities within this field. For further protection, this research also provides both general and specific countermeasures against each vulnerability, serving as an evaluation framework for both existing and future projects.},

  abstract={This paper presents the design and simulation of MEMS based piezoresistive pressure sensor for microfluidic applications. Geometrical parameters are very much considerable when designing microstructure of the pressure sensor. Hence, an analysis is carried out by changing the dimensional parameters of three different diaphragm geometries namely square shaped diaphragm, circular shaped diaphragm and cross sectional beam shaped diaphragm respectively. This is performed in three dimensional mesh plots using Matlab. The Finite Element Method (FEM) analyses are performed in COMSOL and by comparing the results, the square type diaphragm is chosen as best diaphragm geometry for the microfluidic applications. In addition, modal analysis is carried out by using Ansys to identify the natural frequency of the best diaphragm geometry. Also Piezoresistive sensing elements are designed and simulated by performing coupled field analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics. Simulation results reveal that piezo resistive square type pressure sensors have high sensitivity in a wide range of pressures.},

In many scenarios, it is very common that nodes have the capability of mobility. For example, the nodes in body area networks move together with the movement of users. The MAC protocol in such applications should take the group mobility into account. We introduce a simple MAC protocol which combines TDMA and FDMA to deal with the mobile clusters in wireless sensor networks. Our solution is that the nodes are classified into two different sub-networks according to their mobility. The two sub-networks utilize different frequencies to communicate and then, through the cooperation between the two networks, the uploading of packets sensed is achieved. It is an efficient way to avoid collision and interference brought by a mobile cluster.},

The antenna consists of a double differential-feed $45^\circ$-rotated square patch with four capacitively coupled $\Gamma$-probes. The proposed design utilizes the TM10 resonant mode of the patch for the lower resonance, whereas four trapezoidal slots are symmetrically etched on the patch to generate the upper resonance. By examining the feeding locations, the four slots can be excited simultaneously, yielding a high-gain radiation at the upper resonance.

The fabricated prototype with a profile of 0.06$\lambda _{\text{2.45-GHz}}$ yields a measured 10 dB return loss bandwidth of 2.40–2.52 GHz and 5.09–5.41 GHz, an isolation of $\ge$44 and 41 dB, a gain of 8.5 and 9.2 dBi, and a cross-polarization level of $\le$−32 and −22 dB for the lower and upper bands, respectively.},

  abstract={There are six deserts and sandy lands in the central and western part of Inner Mongolia, which is one of the main sources of sandstorms in China. In most areas, the surface is dry, the precipitation is low and the wind is strong in winter and spring. The analysis and study of sandstorms in this area is of great significance to the study and prediction of sandstorms in China. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the research status of sandstorms at home and abroad, the application of convolution neural network to classify satellite cloud images and establish prediction models of sandstorms are relatively few. The convolution neural network algorithm based on transfer learning is used to classify infrared satellite cloud images to establish Sand-dust Storm Prediction model, and the prediction accuracy of sand-dust storm prediction model established under different learning strategies is compared in the paper. The results show that the model training speed is fast and the accuracy and generalization ability of the model are improved by using the parameter migration initialization network in transfer learning. The Sand-dust Storm Prediction Model Based on the convolution neural network algorithm of transfer learning has a higher accuracy in predicting the occurrence of sand-dust storm and the change of learning strategies has an important influence on the prediction accuracy of sandstorm prediction model.},

The antenna has a high isolation level (below -15 dB), and a peak gain of around 2.3 dBi across the tuning frequency range. The agreement between measured and simulated results shows successful performance and characteristics satisfying various MIMO parameters requirements.},

  abstract={The article presents the method of radioelectronic devices diagnosing, based on mathematical modeling of electrical characteristics and circuit operation modes, as well as on application of the Kohonen network for data processing and clustering. The developed method allows to automatically diagnose the technical condition of an electronic device by analyzing the amplitude-frequency characteristics in the control points. TVhen implementing the method for circuit modeling and obtaining the family of amplitude-frequency characteristics, the computer-aided design system NI Multisim was used, and the high-level language Python was used for creating the program code of functional modules. On the basis of the experimental data the fault database of the electronic device was formed, the processing of the information arrays is carried out by the artificial neural network, based on the self-organizing Kohonen maps. Fault classification model allows to automate the process of diagnosis and to identify the technical state of an electronic device.},
