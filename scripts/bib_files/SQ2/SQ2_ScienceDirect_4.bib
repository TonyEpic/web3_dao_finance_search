abstract = {The last few years, research in wireless multi-hop networks or ad hoc networks is mainly driven by a search for efficient routing protocols. From an application point of view, it is obvious that nodes (users) will only setup connections with a specific goal, i.e., in order to use services and resources that are available in or reachable through the ad hoc network. Consequently, resource and service discovery protocols that allow nodes to learn about the available services in the network are indispensable. In this paper, we compare the performance of two basic decentralized resource and service discovery techniques, namely proactive and reactive discovery, through simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results show that the choice between them is not straightforward. It highly depends on the network and service characteristics and on the interaction with the underlying routing protocols. Therefore, our analysis provides protocol developers with some guidelines for developing new or extending existing resource and service discovery protocols for operation in mobile ad hoc networks. In addition, concrete suggestions for developing an integrated adaptive multi-mode solution for both resource and service discovery and routing in mobile ad hoc networks are presented.}

Small batch sizes down to a batch size of “1” lead to a high complexity in the design and economical manufacturing of these customized products. Intralogistics system are integrated into higher-level areas (segment level) as well as into upstream and downstream performance units (system-wide areas). This includes the logistic activities relevant for the system (organized according to storage, picking, transport) such as transportation or storage tasks of tools, semi-finished products, components, assemblies and containers, and waste. Today’s centralized material flow control systems, which work based on predefined processes, are not capable and more specifically not suitable to deal with the arising complexity of changeable intralogistics systems. Autonomous, decentralized material flow control systems distribute the required decision-making and control processes on intelligent logistic entities. A major step for the development of an autonomous control method for hybrid intralogistics systems (manual, semi-automated and automated) is the development of a generic archetype for intralogistics systems regarding the system boundaries, elements and relations resulting in a descriptive model taking into account amongst others the time of demand, availability of resources, economic efficiency and technical performance parameters. The ESB Logistics Learning Factory at ESB Business School (Reutlingen University) serves for this as a close-to-reality development and validation environment.}

The sample organizations were comprised of government ministries, central agencies, state development offices, and district offices. The results show that the central government has successfully delegated its authority to the state and district levels to the extent of operational and tactical planning as well as decision making. The efforts at decentralization have resulted in greater participation in developmental activities and more effective and efficient administration of development projects. To further enhance the development planning process, the government has introduced computerized information systems known as SETIA and SIAP which have increased the capacity for planning and implementation of the development projects. This demonstrates that the success of the projects depends heavily on careful planning, implementation, and optimal utilization of the resources allocated.}

The traditional policy decisions of increasing supply and reducing demand centrally, by building new power plants and/or load shedding, have been insufficient. Locally installed microgrids along with consumer demand response can be suitable decentralized options to augment the centralized grid based systems and plug the demand–supply gap. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) develop a framework to identify the appropriate decentralized energy options for demand–supply matching within a community, and, (2) determine which of these options can suitably plug the existing demand–supply gap at varying levels of grid unavailability. A scenario analysis framework is developed to identify and assess the impact of different decentralized energy options at a community level and demonstrated for a typical urban residential community – Vijayanagar, Bangalore in India. A combination of LPG based CHP microgrid and proactive demand response by the community is the appropriate option that enables the Vijayanagar community to meet its energy needs 24/7 in a reliable, cost-effective manner. The paper concludes with an enumeration of the barriers and feasible strategies for the implementation of community microgrids in India based on stakeholder inputs.}

As cities are the locus of the majority of global energy use, attention is increasingly being directed toward what can be done to improve the sustainability of urban energy systems. One solution receiving attention involves the increased use of decentralized energy supply resources, which reduce the distance between the point where usable energy is created and where it is ultimately consumed. This chapter examines these technologies in light of the limitations and challenges posed by the existing electric grid and the promise of the much-touted ‘smart grid’. The chapter presents a broader view of the urban energy system than is typically discussed, highlighting the role that shared thermal systems and electric ‘microgrids’ can play in providing a bridge toward a lower-carbon future.}

In this field, a particular challenge is the determination of an effective pricing scheme that is able to produce benefits for all participants. In this paper, a novel dynamic pricing methodology is presented, offering a market-oriented means to drive decentralized energy trading and to optimize financial benefits for owners of distributed energy resources. Firstly, a price-responsive model for each type of distributed energy resource is investigated. Particularly, the decoupled State of Charge function is proposed to calculate the value of a single charging/discharging action for energy storage systems. In addition, an adaptable three-tiered framework is designed, including micro-grid balancing, aggregator scheduling, and trading optimization. By launching Tier I, II, and III, the spot prices for participants are iteratively updated and optimized in inner-micro-grid, inner-aggregator, and inter-aggregators level. The framework is able to maximize the financial savings from renewable energy, and meanwhile, provide a dynamic price signal to assist stakeholders in determining response actions and trading strategies. A realistic case is simulated using Java Agent Development framework based multi-agent modeling. The results indicate that the presented methodology enables decentralized energy trading and permits easier marketization of micro-grids with a high share of distributed energy resources.}

Ethereum is a blockchain 2.0 platform that allows developers to build a decentralized application (DApp) without building a new blockchain from scratch. IoT is the technology to embed all physical devices with sensors and chips to provide automation via machine-to-machine communication. Blynk is a platform that provides iOS and Android applications for users and developers to collect data from microcontroller. Our goal in this chapter is to build a blockchain-based, DApp named Uranus for smart building system management with private Ethereum blockchain, Raspberry Pi (RPi), Blynk platform, and sensors (e.g., DHT11). The blockchain technology in Uranus provides three benefits: (1) it is tamper-resistant, (2) it has no single point of failure, and (3) it is trusted and auditable. The system is a proof-of-concept (PoC) system prototype to simulate smart building applications. It collects real-time building temperature and humidity through a DHT11 sensor via RPi. The sensor data is updated to the Blynk app and stored on the smart contract deployed on the private Ethereum blockchain. If the real-time temperature or humidity value exceeds the threshold value set by the users, red or green LEDs will be turned on as warnings and then an air conditioner or dehumidifier will be turned on. We build a PoC smart building system to verify its feasibility and demonstrate its performance based on a simulated testbed.}

Based on his analytical framework, we show that a decentralized system may at times be inferior in efficiency to a centralized system under a democratic decision rule (Proposition 2). An intuition for this result is that, under majority rule, a majority may choose an extreme policy in a local district that best matches its own preference but ignores the interests of minorities. In some cases, such disregard of minority taste may result in a considerable loss of efficiency. If instead some moderate policies are chosen through voting in an integrated constituency, then the interests of minorities could be better served to some extent. As a result, centralization would improve social welfare.}

To leverage the potential of such exchange platforms, this paper reports on a Design Science Research project aiming to derive and validate design principles for establishing trust in inter-organizational capacity exchange in two design iterations. Using blockchain technology, we instantiate six design principles into an artifact and perform experimental evaluations to investigate their effect on perceived trust. Our paper contributes to research and practice by identifying and applying prescriptive design knowledge and advancing our understanding of how to design trust-enabling inter-organizational systems.

Analyzing design principles and supply chain sustainability are critical for organizational success in today's competitive marketplace. The process of evaluating an organization's supply chain design principles and manufacturing sustainability entails incorporating various sources of information, which are typically uncertain, incomplete, and subjective in nature. Particularly when various organizations are confronted with significant principles such as a lack of interoperability, decentralization, virtualization, real-time and capabilities, service orientation, and so on. Using graph theory and a matrix approach (GTMA), this article attempts to analyze the interaction between design principles-related factors with a focus on operational excellence, growth and sustainability in supply chains by considering the business of Industry 4.0. We have considered electrical equipment manufacturing Industry 4.0 as test ground. Based on a literature review and expert opinions, we identified several key principles, and then explored the most significant one using graph theory and a matrix approach. The findings indicate that autonomy has been evaluated as the most significant challenge to manage design principles most effectively for sustainable manufacturing in the Industry 4.0 context. Therefore, organizations must enhance autonomous systems capable of operating and making decisions alone, without relying on external instructions or support, in order to achieve sustainability. This and the other identified principles to achieving corporate supply chain sustainability are ranked in this paper. These findings will be useful for managers and policymakers managing the interaction between people and processes, as well as corporate sustainability management in Industry 4.0-based supply chain organizations. The unique contributions of this paper can aid in the improvement of design principles and the sustainability of emerging economies' Industry 4.0 perspectives.}

This setup leads to an imbalance in the balance of payment, an increase of debt and budget asphyxia, whereas renewable resources are widely and abundantly available. The objective of this paper is to carry out a feasibility analysis of off-grid stand-alone renewable technology generation system for some remote rural areas in one Sahelian country. A survey conducted in 2006, within the framework of microgrids project, in rural areas located in three different regions in Senegal (Thies, Kaolack and Fatick) permits determination of demand estimations. Two reference technologies are chosen, namely a solar photovoltaic (PV) system of 130 Wc for solar endowment and a wind turbine of 150 W for wind speed. Taking into account the life-cycle-cost and the environmental externalities costs, our results show that the levelized electricity costs of PV technology are lower than the cost of energy from the grid extension for all these three regions. Thus, decentralized PV technologies are cost-competitive in comparison to a grid extension for these remote rural areas. For wind technology viabilities results are attained with a requirement demand lower than 7. 47 KWh/year for Thies and 7.884 KWh/year for the two remaining areas, namely Kaolack and Fatick. The additional advantage of the proposed methodology is that it allows the environmental valuation of energy generated from non-renewable resource.}

abstract = {Today's production planning and control systems are based on a centralized planning concept and architecture resulting in a limited ability to adapt to organizational structure and procedures. A twofold object-oriented approach is undertaken for the redesign of production planning and control. To increase the flexibility and adaptability of such systems, this paper first outlines a concept of decentralized production planning and control. This is based on a distribution of production and operations management tasks to interacting autonomous organizational units, structuring manufacturing in an object-oriented manner. The essential feature of each unit is the integration of planning, realization and control tasks, planning being based on time frames. Second, it is shown how the concept can be realized by means of an object-oriented information systems development. A generic information system is designed for the general properties of an organizational unit. Taking advantage of object-oriented technology (e.g. inheritance, reuseability), it serves as a reference and building block for the design of local information systems each supporting an individual organizational unit. The generic information system is customized to the required features of a specific organizational unit according to the level of planning and the organizational structure of the domain. The overall system is set up by a network of such customized local information systems.}

Gene drives also raise complex biosafety challenges and face scrutiny due to an allegedly-outsized involvement of certain philanthropic- and military funders. Against this background, this text is the first to develop a systematic account of the organizational structure that underpins global gene drive research. Applying social network analysis to data on co-authorship and research funding, I show that global gene drive research has limited organizational and geographical diversity and is firmly dominated by elite US-based organizations, with organizations from developing countries either playing marginal roles or being excluded altogether. Additionally, a preliminary analysis of financial transfers suggests that an overwhelming share of global research funding passes from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Imperial College London; and from the US National Institutes of Health to various first- and second-tier US research universities. Overall, the organizational structure implies a considerable legitimacy deficit in global scientific collaboration on a controversial novel biotechnology with significant biosafety risks yet potentially transformative impacts on key challenges of sustainable development.}

However, despite their prevalence, little is known about how SMPs organize to orchestrate collective efforts of social innovation. Taking stock of information systems and organizational literature on platforms, we identify four dimensions inherent in platform organizing (i.e., identity, boundary, governance, and technology). We then analyze three case studies to interrogate how these organizing dimensions manifest in SMPs. As a result, we offer a conceptual framework highlighting the trade-offs SMPs face, specifying the design choices they can make, and exposing the interdependences between dimensions. We further illustrate how these interdependences inform a configurational perspective of SMPs and suggest avenues to advance a configurational research agenda to deepen understanding of SMPs as effective vehicles to address Grand Challenges.}

Results of the study emphasize the need for proper problem-structuring prior to the formulation of actions; the challenges of moving from planning to action; the importance of user involvement in the development of tools; and how a good match of people, problem-structuring, proactiveness and participatory tools development is required for effective decision support provision.

The Action Research approach is shown to be useful in bridging the gap between theory and practice, aiding the development of decision support tools of immediate and practical benefit to organizations.}

This both violates the independence of the cells from the entire production system in terms of facilities and prevents the reduction of both materials and parts transportation. The structure with mini-storage facilities, which are located very close to the cells and serve in connection with the cells in a decentralized manner, has many benefits in comparison with the structure of the central storage. However, estimating the economic value of the decentralized approach is not easy because of the difficulties of measuring non-value adding activities. In order to provide decision support for conversion to the decentralized mini-storages, a methodology based on an activity-based costing (ABC) model was developed. The methodology was also evaluated with an example.}

We expect the technologies that comprise IoT to become smarter; to autonomously reason, act, and communicate with other entities in the environment; and to achieve shared goals. To realize the full potential of these systems, we must understand the mechanisms that allow multiple intelligent entities to effectively operate, collaborate, and learn in changing and uncertain environments. The future IoT devices must not only maintain enough intelligence to perceive and act locally, but also possess team-level collaboration and adaptation processes. We posit that such processes embody energy-minimizing mechanisms found in all biological and physical systems, and operate over the objectives and constraints that can be defined and analyzed locally by individual devices without the need for global centralized control. In this chapter, we represent multiple IoT devices as a team of intelligent agents, and postulate that multiagent systems achieve adaptive behaviors by minimizing a team’s free energy, which decomposes into distributed iterative perception (inference) and control (action) processes. First, we discuss instantiation of this mechanism for a joint distributed decision-making problem. Next, we present experimental evidence that energy-based teams outperform utility-based teams. Finally, we discuss different learning processes that support team-level adaptation.}

This paper presents a universal framework for a blockchain platform that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in the retail electricity market. Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading. Moreover, the authentic gas consumption and computational time to the smart contract indicate that this platform is able to achieve an efficient and effective transaction with multi-player participation.}

Based on a village study in Tanzania, the effects of decentralized forest management on forest conservation, rural livelihoods and good governance are evaluated. Tree growth is estimated to exceed harvest, and forest utilization appears effectively controlled. Forest revenues cover the costs of management and finance local public services, but the underlying taxes and regulations have made the poorest worse off. Governance outcomes are also ambiguous. Revenues are administered transparently, but village leaders are coercive toward forest dependent minorities. The case provides a rare example of how decentralized forest management works in Africa when meaningful powers are devolved to local communities.}

The data gather intelligent metering equipment from the Internet of Things, while self-enforcing smart contracts identify programmatically the anticipated energy flexibility at the level of each prosumer, the related benefits or penalties, and the regulations for balancing energy demand with grid-level energy production. Consensus-based validation will be used to validate demand response programs and to enable the flexibility providers’ suitable economic settlement. The method was validated using a prototype of several structures from literature information sets. The results demonstrate that the blockchain-based distributed demand-side management is capable to match energy demand and generation at smart grid level, the demand response indicator being tracked with high precision, while the amount of energy flexibility needed for merging is decreased.}

In this work, we propose a secure and autonomous big data sharing system (BBS) based on a permissioned blockchain. In our system, we refer to the data stored at a blockchain node but outside the ledger for sharing as “off-state”, such as the large amounts of data (called “big data”) that cannot be stored directly in a blockchain ledger in practice. To securely and autonomously share the off-state data, we further design an off-state sharing protocol. In the proposed protocol, a sender registers the big data with BBS for sharing. To acquire the big data, an authenticated and authorized receiver has to propose transactions and interact with BBS in five phases, including data transfer authorization, data transfer, two-time key request, and data decryption. The key advantage of BBS is its ability to defeat dishonest users and autonomously perform the aforementioned five phases. The corresponding transactions are recorded in the ledger, serving as chain of custody evidences that document the data trail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system, we have designed and implemented prototypes of BBS for sharing big files over two representative permissioned blockchains, i.e., Hyperledger Fabric and Enterprise Ethereum. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the feasibility and performance of our system.}

The framework separates three layers: an organization's core activities, its peripheral activities, and its external environment. We find that firms that have come far in their transformations are more embedded in platform ecosystems with unclear business boundaries. Relatedly, we identify a tension between decentralizing versus centralizing power across organizational layers during a firm's digital transformation and how this dynamic affects corporate strategies and firms' internal and external boundaries.}

This paper highlights an aspect which has not surfaced in the organization theory literature on centralization and decentralization — that the pendulous movement between the two is driven, as much as anything else, by an inherent “internal” dynamic between and within the nature of the written terms, and within the nature of human beings.}

Our system decentralizes critical information about the manufacturer and makes it available on a peer-to-peer network composed of fiduciary nodes to ensure transparency and data provenance through a verifiable audit trail. We present a testbed platform through a combination of manufacturing machines, system-on-chip platforms and computing nodes to demonstrate mechanisms through which a consortium of disparate organizations can communicate through a decentralized network. Our prototype testbed demonstrates the value of computer code residing on a decentralized network for verification of information on the blockchain and ways in which actions can be autonomously initiated in the physical world.

abstract = {Uncontrolled anthropogenic activities carried out for many years are behind the spillage into our water bodies of a high number of chemicals of environmental concern. Even though framework directives on water policies describing monitoring programs for controlling water contaminants have been released and amended during the last few decades, it appears not to have been fully materialized. There is an urgent need for searching for deployable analytical tools that initially help in the strict detection of priority pollutants and could perform as alert systems too. Electrochemical sensor approaches have been identified as suitable candidates in this scenario. With this short review, we aim to provide an overview on recent advances in the fabrication of compact electroanalytical tools with the potential for being readily applied in decentralized studies of water contamination events.}

We instantiate a local copy of the virtual structure state on each vehicle as well as the same coordination algorithm. Then we develop consensus strategies to guarantee that each instantiation of the virtual structure state comes into consensus when the virtual structure state is driven by a common input or inputs with bounded inconsistency under both fixed and switching interaction topologies. We show conditions under which consensus can be achieved for each instantiation of the virtual structure state and provide boundedness analyses for the inconsistency of different instantiations when inconsistent inputs exist. The decentralized framework is then applied in simulations to a multi-vehicle formation control scenario as a proof of concept.}

Increasingly, HROs have incorporated remote and virtual organizational structures, where members work in coordinated ways over long distances. These reliability-seeking virtual organizations (RSVOs) apply HRO principles in settings where members are virtual and work is challenging, whether due to geography or operational demands. Research suggests that organizational structuring, trust and knowledge sharing are essential in RVSOs. Yet, as virtualization extends into areas that stress or exceed human capacity, due to the nature of the area (e.g., polar regions or warzones) or speed (e.g., fully-automated contracts), we expect the increasing participation of machines and artificial intelligence in maintaining organizational reliability. This mixed human-AI operation raises questions about the traditional principles of high reliability. This research therefore explores the challenges of applying HRO principles to RSVOs that operate in resource-poor and extreme settings. We explore issues in organizational structure, trust, culture, and communication, in a case study of Arctic emergency response networks and other remote RSVOs at the margins.}

Oracles provide a mechanism to input data to the smart contracts for decentralized applications in a trusted manner. Oracles are the entities that collect data from data sources, verify it and then transmit it to the Blockchain. The introduction of Oracles has brought back the issues of centralization, single point of failure and reliance on a trusted third party in the Blockchain ecosystem. Oracles have adopted different means to reduce centralization and achieve some trustless operating mechanisms involving decentralized algorithms based on voting or reputation. In this paper, we analyse the concept of the Blockchain Oracle problem, its effects on various Blockchain applications, various Oracle types and trust mechanisms.

The aim of this chapter is to not only to provide electricity but also multiple services to wide rural areas. This method is especially adapted to developing countries in which the electrical system is still restricted to urban areas. Among the research performed, a specific R&D effort has been done to define planning software and also to enhance the performance of autonomous systems such as photovoltaic systems, wind energy systems, diesel or hydro micro-plants. A particular emphasis has been put on financial aspects and especially the determination of tariff structures compatible with the low revenues of rural populations.}

However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platform’s potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.}

Using concepts drawn from organizational theory and the economics of organizations, we examine the potential of centralized and decentralized planning and management structures to be efficient in light of the informational problems that must be overcome to allocate resources efficiently. We focus in particular on the need to integrate information regarding: (1) the effectiveness and efficiency of alternative clinical interventions and of alternative ways organize the delivery of health care; (2) the needs, values, and preferences in the population; and (3) local circumstances that affect delivery of care across regions. Informational concerns suggest that decentralized structures have greater potential to be efficient. We then briefly discuss some principles for the design of decentralized structures to aid in realizing these potential efficiency gains.}

However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet. The experimental results show that our scheme can more securely solve the problem of excessive privacy leakage of medical users within a feasible timeframe.}

Paramount importance is given to microgrids (MGs), while both of its modes (isolated and grid connected) are analyzed to examine the features of economic dispatch and system's net revenue in our prototypic. To deal with uncertainty in the demand curves, an innovative approach is adopted for the classification of electric load, according to their physical characteristics and user preferences. Furthermore, electricity generation is predominantly dependent on renewable energy sources (RESs), facilitated with the energy storage systems (ESSs); optimal scheduling methodology for power is introduced to tackle its intrinsically stochastic nature. Our problem minimizes the power system's aggregated cost with respect to power generation, consumption, and worst case transaction costs.

Community-led land tenure reform requires specification of “the community,” and this raises long-standing issues concerning the balance between civil and traditional local authorities in Africa. Recent experience with decentralization of authority over land suggests that the cost of creating new local land administration capacities is high. A less costly option is reliance at least in part upon traditional authorities, who de facto retain considerable popular legitimacy and still control land in much of rural Africa, and experience suggests opportunities for creative institutional amalgams of civil and traditional local authority. There are very considerable differences among traditional authority structures in Africa, and so the potential of this approach will vary from case to case. In developing such decentralized systems, the interests of transparency and accountability will best be served by creating checks and balances between the different levels of land administration.}

The resilience of physical infrastructure impacts the availability of emergency resources, while asymmetric resource dependence among emergency cooperation organizations influences the effectiveness of the coordinated emergency response. This study has formulated differential game encompassing three emergency response models: autonomous participation, government-led, and collaborative response. These models have been designed to account for scenarios involving infrastructure damage and asymmetric resource dependence scenarios to compute the optimal level of emergency response efforts by both government and social organizations, the government cost-sharing ratio, the optimal level of emergency resource availability, and disaster response performance. The results indicated that, under specific conditions, government cost-sharing can motivate social organizations to actively engage in disaster response, leading to improvement in disaster response performance. The collaborative emergency response model outperformed the other models regarding optimal emergency response strategy and disaster response performance. Notably, infrastructure damage and asymmetric resource dependence lead to a reduction in the optimal level of emergency response efforts and system disaster response performance for both parties. Furthermore, the impact of infrastructure damage on disaster response performance and the optimization of emergency resource availability levels are shown to be more substantial than the effects of asymmetric resource dependence.

It was found that the implementation of distributed leadership could exert a significant positive impact on teacher career satisfaction in the Chinese cultural context. In addition, distributed leadership could positively influence career satisfaction indirectly through the full mediation of teacher empowerment and organizational commitment, and teacher empowerment had a greater mediating effect than organizational commitment.}

Cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system (CVIS) is an important part of the intelligent transport system (ITS). Autonomous vehicles have the potential to improve safety, efficiency, and energy saving through CVIS. Although a few CVIS studies have been conducted in the transportation field recently, a comprehensive analysis of CVIS is necessary, especially about how CVIS is applied in autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we overview the relevant architectures and components of CVIS. After that, state-of-the-art research and applications of CVIS in autonomous vehicles are reviewed from the perspective of improving vehicle safety, efficiency, and energy saving, including scenarios such as straight road segments, intersections, ramps, etc. In addition, the datasets and simulators used in CVIS-related studies are summarized. Finally, challenges and future directions are discussed to promote the development of CVIS and provide inspiration and reference for researchers in the field of ITS.}

Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms. To effectively leverage decentralized trust as a novel aspect of competitive actions, business leaders must pursue Web3 technologies that are reliable, high-growth market segments that are credible, and ventures that are investable.}

To avoid an unavailable coordination center of the whole network, a DD-ARO model is firstly proposed based on the parallelizing-distributed (PD) framework, which allocates the task of tie-line power coordination in the virtual center to the neighboring stakeholders. According to the properties of nonlinear ARO, a modified analytical target cascading method is further developed to formulate the consistency constraints on shared tie-lines, thus guaranteeing the optimality and enhancing the solution quality of the DD-ARO model. Finally, an iterative solution algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the resulting multi-level non-convex DD-ARO model. Case studies and computational results illustrate the effectiveness of the DD-ARO approach for an AC/DC hybrid multi-microgrid system under normal and faulty communications.}

The next step in this trend is to decentralize ADSs to microgrids (MGs). This paper aims to present a review on the recent advancements in the development of ADSs and MGs. In this respect, the regulatory requirements and economic concepts, by which the traditional passive DNs are evolved into ADSs, are categorized and illustrated first. Then, the state-of-the-art of ADS formation is detailed based on the novel standpoint of grid operation factors which are involved in deregulated electricity markets at the distribution level. After presenting highlighted projects of MGs across the world, a similar review approach has been adopted to explain the formation of MGs which play a vital role in the decentralization of ADSs.

This paper focuses on the multi-autonomous-satellite coordination and scheduling problem which is formulated by a novel mathematical model based on the multi-agent system (MAS). To solve the problem, we firstly analyze general organizational structures for the MAS and propose a new dynamic-distributed organizational structure. For these different structures, an improved contract network protocol (ICNP) and a blackboard model (BM) negotiation mechanism are proposed to coordinate the satellites. Then, an online single-satellite scheduling algorithm is proposed to schedule the tasks. In the experiments, we build up a multi-satellite system to analyze the performance of different autonomous coordination mechanisms. Experimental results indicate that the ICNP mechanism can increase the total revenue and reduce the inter-satellite communication cost. In scenarios where satellites could break down randomly, the BM can reduce the revenue losses and the number of task failures efficiently, which proves the good performance of the proposed methods in terms of robustness. The proposed methods have important practicality in the real application of the multi-autonomous-satellite system.}

In response to the problems associated with centralized authorities (e.g. single point of failure, limited scalability, lack of user control), new identity management models have emerged, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which relies on verifiable data registers to validate Decentralized Identifier (DIDs) and can be achieved in many different ways, e.g. through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), distributed databases or other decentralized systems. The main goal of SSI is to enable users to take control of managing their data shared with different services. In this paper, we examine a possible application of the SSI concept to aerial base station (ABS)- integrated networks. The paper presents the effective use of DID implementation to provide a secure and decentralized way to create, associate and verify credentials and identities of ABSs, ensuring secure communication between Ground Base stations (GBSs) and other nodes in the network in a multi-operator scenario. In the numerical results, the average values of various metrics (namely, the average credential presentation time, the average credential offer time, the average DIDcomm connection creation time, the average DIDcomm signing time, and the average DIDcomm revoke credential time) related to credential operations in a DID management system are given for three different number of requests (50 K, 75 K, and 100 K). We have also provided the values of the different status codes that occurred in 100 K operations in the same DID management system. Towards the end of the paper, a comparison is made between SSI-based and Non-fungible token (NFT)-based blockchain solutions, also discussing the challenges and future directions of SSI solutions in the context of ABS-integrated networks.}

In general the solution method will require every agent to communicate to and have a model of every other agent in the team. To overcome this, a specific subset of systems, called Partially Separable, is defined. These systems only require each agent to have a combined summary of the rest of the team and allows each agent to communicate locally over an acyclic communication network, greatly increasing the scalability of the system.}

To improve school organisational performance and innovativeness, and meet diverse student needs, school leaders should be innovative, risk-takers and proactive, thus applying entrepreneurial practices/strategies and market mechanisms. This study aims to investigate, from a schoolteacher's perspective, the degree of entrepreneurial leadership behaviour (ELB) applied by school principals in European primary schools. Given that school autonomy is perceived as an important predictor of leaders' entrepreneurship, this study investigates the impact of educational macro (autonomy and accountability) and micro (demographics) contexts on ELB by comparing centralised and decentralised European school systems with the highly centralised Greek school system.
Design/methodology/approach
This comparative study was conducted in Greece (630 participants) and in 14 European countries (972 participants). Thornberry's Entrepreneurial Leadership Questionnaire was used, comprising general entrepreneurial leader (GEL), miner (MIN), accelerator (ACC), explorer (EXP) and integrator (INT) behaviours.
Findings
The results revealed that ELB is a multi-dimensional concept, and that all participating teachers perceived ELB application moderately, with more focus on the internal (than external) school environment. Furthermore, the dual-directional macro-contextual influence found in applying ELB indicates that high school autonomy and accountability activate ELB owing to the school's freedom to engage in entrepreneurial ventures, while low autonomy/accountability still activates ELB, but only for organisational survival within hierarchical-bureaucratic school environments. This feature differentiates “intrapreneur/intrepreneur” from “entrepreneur” school principals.
Originality/value
The theoretical basis of entrepreneurial leadership (EL) in education should include entrepreneurial multi-dimensional leadership aspects (competencies, behaviours, skills) and educational context (macro and micro). Implications for school leadership research and practice are also discussed.}

If the correlation structure is unknown to the fusion method, conservative strategies are typically pursued. As such, the parameterization introduced by the ellipsoidal intersection method has been a novel approach to describe unknown correlations, though suitable values for these parameters with proven consistency have not been identified yet. In this article, an extension of ellipsoidal intersection is proposed that guarantees consistent fusion results in the presence of unknown common information. The bound used by the novel approach corresponds to computing an outer ellipsoidal bound on the intersection of inverse covariance ellipsoids. As a major advantage of this inverse covariance intersection method, fusion results prove to be more accurate than those provided by the well-known covariance intersection method.}

The government’s aggressive approach to ecological construction, however, is incongruent with the ecology of the Inner Mongolian drylands. Consequently, although beneficial to short-term economic growth, “ecological construction” has led to unintended grassland degradation, thus undermining environmental sustainability.}

To address this, tailored carbon-zero feedback algorithms are proposed to complement human judgment in agile workflows. Specifically, prescriptive analytics, federated learning, and probabilistic programming are injected into Scrum, Kanban, and Lean respectively to restore clarity amidst ambiguity. The framework is grounded in cases from the textile industry to demonstrate applicability in practical settings. By targeting the roots of distortions with human-algorithm collaborations, it provides an actionable roadmap to implement carbon-zero agility.}

While facing an abnormal situation, many different possible solutions can be defined to mitigate the negative impacts of the disruption and recover the system to its normal operation. Basically, these solutions can be at the plant level or at the enterprise level. To study which solutions are more effective in coping with a disruption, appropriate quantitative models are necessary to evaluate the effect of local behaviors and policies on the overall system performance. In this paper, we will demonstrate how an agent-based model can be used to evaluate the dynamic behavior of a multi-plant enterprise particularly during abnormal situations. Using this model, different mechanisms for coping with abnormality - centralized and decentralized - are also modeled and compared.}

The paper explores the different challenges encountered by these stakeholder institutions in water management. The empowerment approach is used to examine the extent to which the formation of these new water institutions is enhancing the empowerment of different stakeholders in the management of water resources. The paper concludes that effective stakeholder participation is being hampered by lack proper representation of stakeholders on catchment and subcatchment councils; lack of stakeholder involvement in catchment planning; inadequate financial resources for catchment and subcatchment councils for use in water management and the government’s unwillingness to stop land invasions by the ruling party supporters. The data presented in this paper was collected through unstructured interviews, attendance of catchment and subcatchment councils meetings and reviewing of recorded minutes of the Save Catchment and Odzi Subcatchment Councils meetings.}

In addition, these regions have good renewable energy potential. Since the decentralized energy generation (DEG) covers a broad range of technologies, including many renewable energy technologies (RET) that provide small-scale power at sites close to the users, this concept could be of interest for these locations. This paper identifies the areas in Croatia where such systems could be applied. Consideration is given to geographical locations as well as possible applications. Wind, hydro, solar photovoltaic, geothermal, and biomass conversion systems were analyzed from a technological and economic point of view. Since the renewable energy sources (RES) data for Croatia are rather scarce, the intention was to give a survey of the present situation and an estimate of future potential for DEG based on RES. The energy potential (given as capacity and energy capability) and production costs were calculated on a regional basis and per type of RET. Finally, the RES cost–supply curves for 2006 and 2010 are given.}

abstract = {One of the foremost challenges confronting society today is the vulnerability of critical physical infrastructures in urban areas to extreme events. The major challenge in these scenarios despite the availability of the means of communication (e.g. ad-hoc networks, hand held devices) is the lack of trust among the first responders due to their having no prior experience of interactions amongst themselves. Also the spreading of inaccurate or misleading information can have disastrous consequences in the chaotic and hazardous environments which are prevalent in large-scale disasters. Therefore it is imperative that the responders possess the ability to assess and evaluate the trustworthiness as well as the information propagated by fellow responders in order to facilitate collaboration. This paper presents a decentralized trust model to enhance reliable information dissemination in large-scale disasters. The model proposed includes a distributed recommendation scheme, incorporated into an existing membership maintenance service for ad-hoc networks. In addition it has a nature-inspired activation spreading mechanism that allows trust-based information propagation. Search and Rescue exercises involving civil engineers and firefighters were conducted at the Illinois Fire Service Institute (IFSI) to test the software. The upshot of the simulation was immediate and robust establishment of trust and high resilience to the spread of the unreliable information.}

First, for a leaderless team of homogeneous space robots transporting a large object in orbit, a systematic control architecture that includes information flow is developed. Second, based on relative orbit dynamics, a rendezvous guidance law and a rigid formation control law are designed, and the necessary communication topology for the space robot team is discussed. Third, to guarantee the consensus of the motion of the large object with the robot team, both orbital maneuver control and attitude control for the large object are studied Emphasis is placed not on the attitude control law but on the force distribution problem, for which an algorithm exploiting a special property of trigonometric functions is proposed to transfer the necessary attitude control torque to the distributed forces. To support the above control method, an estimation of the motion of the formation center contributed by each robot in a decentralized manner is developed using a Kalman filter. Fourth, the robustness of the system to the failure of one robot is analyzed, and four effective typical fault response modes are proposed. Finally, numerical simulations validated the performance, robustness and practicability of the developed control scheme.}

Steemit is recognized as one of the earliest blockchain-based online communities, and a typical example of DAO. By endowing community members with new roles, the decentralization of blockchain-based communities brings changes to the design of user incentive mechanisms. However, few studies have paid attention to the user incentive mechanism when users play the dual roles of social participant and community owner. On the basis of social capital theory and psychological ownership theory, this study explores Steemit's incentive mechanism by evaluating the impact of these dual roles on user active participation behavior. The study adopts a two-way fixed effect negative binomial regression to test the research model. The results show that users’ social capital, share capital, social feedback, and economic feedback positively affect their active participation behavior. At the same time, social feedback and economic feedback play moderating roles on the effects of the dual capitals. Overall, this research provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for understanding, designing, and governing blockchain-based online communities.}

The coexistence of related notions (sociocracy, holacracy, spaghetti organization, management 3.0 and teal organization) accentuates the need for a theoretical framework. This research aims to fill this gap. Specifically, we conduct a systematic literature review and comparative analysis. We therefore demonstrate that the concept of the liberated firm integrates the five other notions (as modalities or different stages of liberation); that is, it presents the highest degree of humanist values and operates at the highest corporate level.}

We propose a connection-based extension of this framework that permits two autonomous organisations, each employing possibly quite different security lattices, to exchange information while maintaining security of information flow as well as their autonomy in formulating and maintaining security policies. Our prescriptive framework is based on the rigorous mathematical framework of Lagois connections proposed by Melton, together with a simple type system and operational model for transferring object data between the two domains. The merit of this formulation is that it is simple, minimal, adaptable and intuitive. We show that our framework is semantically sound, by proving that the connections proposed preserve standard correctness notions such as noninterference. We then illustrate via examples how Lagois theory also provides a robust framework and methodology for negotiating and maintaining secure agreements on information flow between autonomous organisations, even when either or both organisations change their security lattices. Composition and decomposition properties indicate support for a modular approach to secure flow frameworks in complex organisations. Finally, a natural and conservative extension of the Decentralised Labels Model of Myers et al. shows the applicability of the framework — a Lagois connection between the hierarchies of principals in two organisations naturally induces a Lagois connection between the corresponding security label lattices, thus extending the security guarantees ensured by the decentralised model to encompass bidirectional interorganisational flows.}

The algorithm ensures the resource agent’s ability to cooperate and coordinate on neighbour knowledge requisition for flexible problem solving. The developed algorithm is evaluated by investigating the relationship between the success probability of resource discovery and semantic similarity under different factors. The experiments show the algorithm could flexibly and dynamically discover resources and therefore provide a valuable addition to the field.}

This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.}

Linking the BM and corporate strategy literatures, we discuss important dimensions and consequences of complexity in a BM portfolio. The sharing of similar activities and partners and the redeployment of activities and partners across BMs are important dimensions of the complexity of an integrated BM portfolio. We also suggest that BM portfolio complexity should be aligned with organizational design in terms of the centralization or decentralization of the decision-making process, and identify the positive effect of BM portfolio complexity on building imitation barriers.}

Under general conditions concerning the agent resources and the network topology, conditions are derived for the convergence to zero of the estimation error mean and for the mean-square estimation error boundedness. A centralized strategy based on minimization of the steady-state mean-square estimation error is proposed for selection of the consensus gains; these gains can also be adjusted by local adaptation schemes. It is also demonstrated that there exists a connection between the network complexity and efficiency of denoising, i.e., of suppression of the measurement noise influence. Several numerical examples serve to illustrate characteristic properties of the proposed algorithm and to demonstrate its applicability to real problems.}

Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.}

The core element of the methodology is a linear optimization model with a “total cost” objective function, which includes financial, as well as external costs and benefits. Altitude proves to have decisive influence on energy optimization results, because it affects energy demand. The improvement of local energy systems provides greater socioeconomic benefits in mountainous settlements, due to the high shares of renewables and energy efficiency interventions in the optimal solutions. Energy poverty can be alleviated by redesigning local energy systems and the structure of the energy market. However, spatial and aesthetic restrictions, presented often in mountainous settlements, may affect the operational costs of energy systems, which is a crucial parameter for confronting energy poverty. Furthermore, the study indicates that it could be better to electrify remote areas, far from electricity grids, by decentralized systems than by grid expansion. The results of this study and the assumptions made about the way in which energy market should function, could be utilized for reconsidering energy policy measures, aiming at supporting sensitive societies to improve their development perspectives.}

abstract = {As a representative of a broad class of decentralized control problems, the heating of public buildings, trade centers and similar, is discussed. A system of two layers the layer of direct follow-up control grouping local regulators distributed over the building and the coordination layer in the form of a multi-agent system is proposed as a solution. Outlines of algorithms of agents and specification of information links between them are presented. The heating system together with necessary elements of the environment is modeled in the shape of a simulation program. Simulation studies aiming at evaluation of the solution and final choice (and tuning) of details of the multi-agent system are also reported.}

abstract = {Rapid printed circuit boards (PCB) prototyping refers to the pilot production of PCB before mass production for verifying the circuit design. The rapid PCB prototyping service providers are pursuing the mass individualization paradigm. Yet, these providers suffer from low efficiency and high cost in the large-scale small-batched mixed pilot production of rapid PCB prototyping. To improve the production efficiency in mass individualization of rapid PCB prototyping, this paper proposed a cloud-edge orchestration-based bi-level autonomous process control (CEO-BAPC) framework. A blockchained smart contracts-driven multi-agent system is established at the edge to realize efficient tasks coordination under disturbances. Based on the operation events data and control decisions collected at the edge, a customized deep learning-driven prediction model is established at the cloud for supporting the rescheduling decisions. The blockchained smart contracts (e.g., Stackelberg game solution) at the edge proactively decentralize short-term fine-grained individualized task execution among manufacturing units/machines and make the results available on upper-level deep learning model at the cloud for supporting holistic rescheduling decisions. The bi-level autonomous process control architecture avoids the inconsistency between holistic control and local execution under frequent random disturbances and thereby realizes efficient manufacturing of mass individualization. Through a simulated case based on data collected from a rapid PCB prototyping service provider in China, the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed CEO-BAPC framework are verified.}

abstract = {Decentralization is highly considered as an alternative to make better fisheries management. This is due to that decentralization appears as a means for increasing the efficiency and equity of development activities and services delivery, and also for promoting local participation and democracy. The evolution of decentralization of fisheries management policy in Indonesia showed that the decentralization was gradually developed from deconcentration and delegation to devolution form. After Reform Era, devolution form of decentralization has been implemented due to the enactment of UU 22/1999 (the Local Autonomy Law), where local government has gained the amount of new authorities concerning marine-fisheries management. By such devolution, however, the community based management system, which is rooted from traditional fishing communities, is recognized. The effectiveness of the community based management system for the marine resources sustainability is caused by the bottom up planning and participative approach that led to the increasing of the local fishers’ sense of stewardship over the resources. Even though this kind of decentralization practice has been dealing with several problems, this is still a better way rather than centralization. This paper identifies some agendas are being encountered both in the central and the local level. This is related to the need of improvement of the legal framework, the capacity building of the local government, and the revitalization of the local institution.}

abstract = {The persistent development towards decreasing batch sizes due to an ongoing product individualization, as well as increasingly dynamic market and competitive conditions lead to new changeability requirements in production environments. Since each of the individualized products might require different base materials or components and manufacturing resources, the paths of the products going through the factory as well as the required internal transport and material supply processes are going to differ for every product. Conventional planning and control systems, which rely on predefined processes and central decision-making, are not capable to deal with the arising system’s complexity along the dimensions of changing goods, layouts and throughput requirements. The concepts of “self-organization” in combination with “autonomous control” provide promising solutions to solve these new requirements by using among other things the potential of autonomous, decentralized and target-optimized decision-making. A major enabler for the development towards autonomous changeable intralogistics systems are intelligent logistical objects (e.g. smart products, bins and conveyor systems) which are able to communicate and interact with each other as well as with human workers. To investigate the potential of automation and human-robot collaboration for intralogistics, a research project for the development of a collaborative tugger train has been started at the ESB Logistics Learning Factory in line with various student projects in neighboring research areas. This collaborative tugger train system in combination with other manual (e.g. handcarts) and (semi-)automated conveyor systems (e.g. automated guided forklift) will be integrated into a dynamic, self-organized scenario with varying production batch sizes to develop a method for target-oriented self-organization and autonomous control of intralogistics systems. For a structured investigation of self-organized scenarios a generic intralogistics model as well as a criteria catalogue has been developed. The ESB Logistics Learning will serve as a practice-oriented research, validation and demonstration environment for these purposes.}

abstract = {In countries characterized by a high degree of decentralization, the limits between their main administrative units – that is, their ‘internal borders’ – with jurisdiction over protected natural areas prove critical for their management. This article analyses a national park split by just such an internal border, its objective being to determine the extent to which this border compromises the classic notion of a national park and how it impacts its management. The case study described is that of the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park, located in the centre of Spain, straddling the autonomous regions or communities of Castile and León and the Community of Madrid. The study exploits qualitative techniques, specifically semi-structured interviews with prominent actors in this territory, which allow us to analyse their perceptions of the national park and the implications of the border between the two autonomous communities in which it lies. Our research shows that the effects of internal borders can be similar to those of a border between two States, and that in decentralized countries the concept of transboundary protected areas is valid at the intra-state level. Additionally, the important political role played by national parks at different scales is verified as is the fact that cooperation between Spain’s autonomous communities remains weak.}

Nevertheless, intelligent workshops encounter hurdles related to scalability of nodes, efficiency in validation, configuration of process security, and management of online/offline operations, which pose challenges to the seamless application of blockchain in workshop manufacturing environments. This paper introduces an architecture based on BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) for integrating smart contracts and digital twins manufacturing systems. It explores effective strategies to address the challenges mentioned above, with the aim of enhancing integration and application approaches. (1) Utilizing a graphical model-driven solution for the visualization and configuration of manufacturing resources on the front end, creating a BPMN-driven orchestration diagram and an off-chain/on-chain interoperability model for manufacturing smart contracts, and investigating voting mechanisms and customization methods specific to smart contracts in workshop manufacturing; (2) The two-layer monitoring model based on blockchain 3.0 and Tangle-based verification backend is established by introducing Cached DTs to implement negotiation of smart contracts based on BPMN constraints at the upper level, and supporting device node expansion and verification mechanisms at the lower level, thereby realizing swift synchronization and comprehensive visualization across the entire manufacturing lifecycle; (3) Based on multiple open-source technologies, a decentralized intelligent workshop case that relies on distributed information management is constructed. The comprehensive experimental results underscore the technical superiority of the proposed system architecture.}

A decentralized estimation scheme is designed mainly based on the receding horizon estimation concept. Hereinto, the communication delay and packet loss are modeled in a uniform Markov process. Also, the approach through the reorganization of measurements is comprised to preprocess the delay-affect observations. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}
