abstract = {Blockchain has been recognised as a technological breakthrough with the ability to support new decentralised security-based solutions in sectors such as information technology and finance. Blockchain allows different communities to create Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), which are self-organised democratic organisations controlled by smart contracts. This paper presents a new DAO model for the procurement of services by public organisations, such as government agencies. To demonstrate the advantages of this solution, this work looks specifically at current public procurement systems that resort to third-party contractors that manage these negotiations. Third parties lack the transparency, security, and democratic representation that a DAO can provide. We present the implementation of a DAO as a set of smart contracts executed on Ethereum-compatible permissionless blockchains, supported by a consensus algorithm, replacing third-party contractors.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology enables a new form of online community: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), where members typically vote on proposals using tokens. Enthusiasts claim DAOs provide new opportunities for openness, horizontality, and democratization. However, this phenomenon is still under research, especially given the lack of quantitative studies. This paper presents the first census-like quantitative analysis of the whole ecosystem of DAOs, including 30K DAO communities on the main DAO platforms. This enables us to provide insights into the allegedly "democratic'' nature of DAOs, building metrics concerning their lifespan, participation, and power concentration. Most DAOs have a short lifespan and low participation. There is also a positive correlation between community size and voting power concentration. Like other online communities, DAOs seem to follow the iron law: becoming increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Still, a significant amount of DAOs of varying sizes defy this idea by being egalitarian by design.},

abstract = {The emergence of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) represents a paradigm shift in the organizational structure enabled by distributed digital ledger technologies such as blockchain. Exclusively digital web-based entities, DAOs function independently through blockchain-based smart contracts that rely on distributed governance, community coordination, and incentive mechanisms rather than top-down hierarchies. As DAOs continue to foster an environment conducive to a new class of digital participants, they are becoming increasingly prominent in the digital cryptocurrency economy, raising questions regarding their structure, sustainability, and adoption. Being collectively owned and managed by their members, DAOs exhibit characteristics of both non-zero and zero-sum dynamics, thereby posing a challenge to conventional centralized and hierarchical management models. This mixed-methods study examines DAOs within modern information ecosystems through a literature review, blockchain analysis, and comparative organizational analysis. The literature review synthesizes academic discourse on DAOs, highlighting key theories, such as decentralization, digital governance, and distributed decision-making. Blockchain analysis of 10 leading DAOs provides engagement and activity metrics. Comparative analysis considers the DAOs’ advantages and challenges in relation to traditional centralized organizations, focusing on aspects such as governance, efficiency, and adaptability. The findings reveal DAOs' innovative potential and adoption barriers, such as reliance on token incentives and difficulties with coordinated decision-making due to reasons like concentration of voting power and others. Although DAOs possess advantages in terms of decentralization, community alignment, and transparent algorithmic execution, traditional organizations currently maintain superiority in terms of stability and legal standing. This study provides an interdisciplinary academic perspective on the concept and implementation of the DAO by combining conceptual understanding, empirical blockchain evidence, and comparative analysis. It is concluded that realizing the transformative potential of DAOs requires synthesizing multidisciplinary insights and overcoming substantive adoption hurdles. The proposed framework serves as a foundation for further research on the evolution and integration of DAOs into organizations of the future.},

Concretely, we describe DAOs and their governance needs and highlight gaps between the state of the art of MAS research and the governance needs of DAOs.},

It is most popular for enabling Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. However, blockchain applications span beyond Finance, and recently it has been applied to decentralized governance. Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer. We will illustrate its potential with the case of the DAO Genesis Alpha, which is the main DAO of the DAOstack project.},

However, with increasing security breaches and compliance failures with data protection law, researchers have begun to explore the feasibility of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) as a way of reimagining traditional forms of top-down data governance. In this paper, we describe early findings from the development of a card-based approach for engaging the public in the design of DAOs for collectively governing health data. Following a public workshop, we reflect on how our methodological approach involved laypeople in practical discussions about DAO design elements, such as voting mechanisms. Through group conversations, we observed how values affected the kinds of decentralised organisational structures participants wished to engage in. In particular, our analysis has implications for the future directions of DAO design, by pointing towards flexibility and modularity for voting and proposal interfaces, scalability and balancing power in tokenised communities.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has enabled a thriving emergent ecosystem of tools and communities actively using decentralized systems. However, most blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum) requires users to pay some fees to execute their desired actions in these novel online services. To which extent an increase in the price of such fees negatively affects user activity? Would significant price surges deter users from using blockchain-enabled online services? In this work, we study the 2020 surge of transaction fee price in the Ethereum network, and analyze how that affected user activities. Our use cases are the blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from the platforms DAOstack and DAOhaus. Thus, we analyzed 5,580 transactions from 7,825 users grouped in 191 DAO communities, using a VAR model with a daily time series of the average fee value and the DAO operations. Our results show just a minor influence of the fee (gas) price and the activity of DAO users. The insensitivity of the activity to the fee price is an anomaly in a supposedly self-regulated market, and we consider this should be tackled in future implementations.},

One of the main applications of smart contracts are the so called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), which originated from an idea envisaged by Buterin, in his Ethereum white paper. Indeed, DAOs are decentralized organizations, where the members implement their decisions using smart contracts. In the article, we introduce a simple framework for a DAO, and then we discuss some governance issues. In particular, we focus on how DAO members could be induced to dedicate sufficient time to voting sessions, for a proper functioning of the organization. Indeed, recent empirical research suggests how the members’ participation rate, to voting activities, has a meaningful positive correlation with to a DAO's performance. More specifically, we formalize the notion of attention time and propose a simple model for the so-called Holographic Consensus, a protocol introduced by the DAOStack platform to solve the issue of limited time dedicated to governance, discussing under what conditions DAO members may choose the so-called boosting voting procedure.},

The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation and built cryptographically secure blockchain-based infrastructure to counter this threat. Now, not just on chain transactions are being tracked but every move of participants in blockchain communities. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism if mis-used for social control. This piece analyzes the ways in which decentralization efforts can be a threat to themselves by exploring the question, 'Are "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) the next panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in "autonomous" systems?'. By employing ethnographic methods and case study analysis, this piece provides an important qualitative contribution to the early dynamics of the aspirations and problems of decentralized, autonomous organizations.},

abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

In this research, we introduce Decentralized Autonomous Citizen Participation Organizations (DACPOs). In a DACPO, data and actions are recorded and autonomously executed in a decentralized way. DACPOs can be used for enabling participative budgeting and thereby provide transparency, decrease the risks of fraud and corruption, and increase citizens’ trust. The viability of DACPOs depends on a number of factors, including a minimum number of citizens who participate. In further research, factors influencing the use of DACPOs for participative budgeting can be further analyzed and tested.},

In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.  We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.},

Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

However, these technologies still have some unanswered issues, mostly related to data lookup and discovery. In this paper, first, we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system that efficiently manages decentralized keyword-based queries executed on data stored in DFS. Through a hypercube logical layout, queries are efficiently routed among the network, where each node is responsible for a specific keywords set and the related contents. Second, we provide a framework for the governance of the above network, based on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implementation. We show how the use of smart contracts enables organizational decision making and rewards for nodes that have actively contributed to the DHT. Finally, we provide experimental validation of an implementation of our proposal, where the execution of the same protocol for different logical nodes of the hypercube allows us to evaluate the efficiency of communication within the network.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are a key component of today’s blockchains. They are critical in controlling decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). However, smart contracts are not yet legally binding nor enforceable; this makes it difficult for businesses to adopt the DAO paradigm. Therefore, this study reviews existing Smart Contract Languages (SCL) and identifies properties that are critical to any future SCL for drafting legally binding contracts. This is achieved by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of white- and grey literature published between 2015 and 2019. Using the SLR methodology, 45 Selected and 28 Supporting Studies detailing 45 state-of-the-art SCLs are selected. Finally, 10 SCL properties that enable legally compliant DAOs are discovered, and specifications for developing SCLs are explored.},

abstract = {Remote voting has become more critical in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. Blockchain technology and its benefits such as decentralization, security, and transparency have given rise to proposals for blockchain-based voting systems. However, the traceability of blockchain transactions violates voter anonymity in existing proposals. Besides, transaction costs also need to be considered. Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89\% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at .},

abstract = {Offloading videos from end devices to edge or cloud servers is the key to enabling computation-intensive video analytics. To ensure the analytics accuracy at the server, the video quality for offloading must be configured based on the specific content and the available network bandwidth. While adaptive video streaming for user viewing has been widely studied, none of the existing works can guarantee the analytics accuracy at the server in bandwidth- and content-adaptive way. To fill in this gap, this paper presents DAO, a dynamic adaptive offloading framework for video analytics that jointly considers the dynamics of network bandwidth and video content. DAO is able to maximize the analytics accuracy at the server by adapting the video bitrate and resolution dynamically. In essence, we shift the context of adaptive video transport from traditional DASH systems to a new dynamic adaptive offloading framework tailored for video analytics. DAO is empowered by some new discoveries about the inherent relationship between analytics accuracy, video content, bitrate, and resolution, as well as by an optimization formulation to adapt the bitrate and resolution dynamically. Results from the real-world implementation of object detection tasks show that DAO's performance is close to the theoretical bound, achieving 20\% bandwidth saving and 59\% category-wise mAP improvement compared to conventional DASH schemes.},

abstract = {In the past, the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)” was used to refer to a loosely organized network of autonomous entities, such as a corporation, a cooperative, or a non-profit party. Since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs. The EVM can also run other applications such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a new type of blcokchain-based organization that uses smart contracts to perform tasks on a distributed scale. The smart contracts have organizational rules and operational logic embedded and automatically execute organizational decisions and proposals making it highly decentralized and more democratic. The DAOs are organizations that are not subject to legal, physical, or economic constraints, as well as the ability to operate outside the control of a single central authority or a single governing body. Because DAO is formed by many smart contract that operate together, which makes it highly decentralized and has a strong democratic system. This paper discusses the pros and cons of DAO, and the potential of DAO in community development, especially in non-profit organizations. It is hope to provide an overall picture of DAO, and the roadmap for future development of DAO on the right track.},

Soulbound tokens add an important piece to blockchain technology, as they could be the key to building Web3 and a trustworthy decentralized society. Issued and strictly linked to an account, representing the soul of a user, the soulbound token makes it possible to represent a property that only the user can have and that cannot be transferred, but only removed, which enhances security. To evaluate their impact on blockchain development, we first examine the concept of soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their effective adoption. The application sectors include the creation of digital identity certificates, ownership certificates, reputational certificates, governance, and the healthcare sector. We then report and describe relevant blockchain token standards, including soulbound token standards, provided in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Finally, to study the efficacy of the implementation of soulbound tokens, we propose a case study that includes the design and development of a decentralized vaccine certification prototype based on soulbound tokens. In our system, the vaccination data produced by the health authority is fully decentralized and implemented as the issuance of soulbound tokens for the benefit of a citizen's soul account. As a result, the citizen is the only owner of the vaccination data.},

abstract = {Many emerging sensor network applications operate in challenging environments wherein the base station is unavailable. Data generated from such intermittently connected sensor networks (ICSNs) must be stored inside the network for some unpredictable time before uploading opportunities become available. Consequently, sensory data could overflow the limited storage capacity available in the entire network, making discarding valuable data inevitable. To overcome such overall storage overflow in ICSNs, we propose and study a new algorithmic framework called &lt;underline&gt;d&lt;/underline&gt;ata &lt;underline&gt;a&lt;/underline&gt;ggregation for &lt;underline&gt;o&lt;/underline&gt;verall storage &lt;underline&gt;o&lt;/underline&gt;verflow (&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$text {DAO}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;). Utilizing spatial data correlation that commonly exists among sensory data, &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$text {DAO}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; employs data aggregation techniques to reduce the overflow data size while minimizing the total energy consumption in data aggregation. At the core of our framework are two new graph theoretical problems that have not been studied. We refer to them as &lt;underline&gt;t&lt;/underline&gt;raveling &lt;underline&gt;s&lt;/underline&gt;alesmen &lt;underline&gt;p&lt;/underline&gt;lacement &lt;underline&gt;p&lt;/underline&gt;roblem (&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$text {TSP}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;) and quota traveling salesmen placement problem (Q-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$text {TSP}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;). Different from the well-known multiple traveling salesman problem (mTSP) and its variants, which mainly focus on the routing of multiple salesmen initially located at fixed locations, &lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$text {TSP}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; and Q-&lt;inline-formula&gt; &lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$text {TSP}^{2}$ &lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; must decide the placement as well as the routing of the traveling salesmen. We prove that both problems are NP-hard and design approximation, heuristic, and distributed algorithms. Our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art data aggregation work with base stations by up to 71.8% in energy consumption.},

abstract = {The security and usability of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications depend on the secure management of cryptographic keys. However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work we first revisit the problem of threshold ECDSA by considering the commonly admissible 'server-aided' model, namely, the presence of a semi-honest and non-colluding service provider. Then, we leverage that model and consider cases where that 'server' is distributed, introducing the novel concept of unstoppable wallets; hence eliminating any single point of failure. Unstoppable wallets are programmable threshold ECDSA wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We construct highly efficient threshold ECDSA protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security in the server-aided model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority among the signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold ECDSA key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead.We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these protocols, written in a smart contract language, deployed on the Secret Network - a blockchain that plays the role of the server. Using that deployment, we showcase the protocols' applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.},

abstract = {Traditional Blockchain Sharding approaches can only tolerate up to n/3 of nodes being adversary because they rely on the hyper-geometric distribution to make a failure (an adversary does not have n/3 of nodes globally but can manipulate the consensus of a Shard) hard to happen. The system must maintain a large Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low failure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this paper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up to n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and every Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that this design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one class) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more Shards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The improved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation for decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.},

abstract = {Recent blockchain-technology related innovations enable the governance of collaborating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to engage in agile business-network collaborations that are based on the novel concept of smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely coupled collaboration lifecycle with the main steps of setup, enactment, possible rollbacks and finally, an orderly termination. This lifecycle supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs, smart contract negotiations, and behavior monitoring during enactment with the potential for breach management. Based on a sound understanding of the collaboration lifecycle in a Governance- as-a-Service (GaaS)-platform, a new type of conflict management must safeguard business-semantics induced consistency rules. This conflict management involves breach detection with recovery aspects. To fill the detected gap, we employ a formal design-notation that comprises the definition of structural and behavioral properties for exploring conflict-related exception- and compensation management during a decentralized collaboration. With the formal approach, we generate a highly dependable DAO-GaaS conflict model that does not collapse under left-behind clutter such as orphaned processes and exponentially growing database entries that require an unacceptable periodic GaaS reset.},

abstract = {The accessible ubiquity of mobile devices appeals to a variety of users, including people with disabilities. To adequately address this diversity of heterogeneous users, it would be necessary to design mobile applications guided by universal design. Universal mobile app design makes apps accessible to a variety of people, regardless of their characteristics, age or abilities. Due to technical limitations, applications cannot always inherit settings from Operating Systems. However, we can say that, on the one hand, operating systems move towards universal access, providing accessibility settings. On the other hand, mobile applications present an obstacle for this advance to happen. One way to mitigate the problem of low mobile app flexibility is to identify early in the mobile app development process a set of accessible customization guidelines that direct developers to include them in their apps. Still, many customizations are not specific to configuration requirements, and others are not designed based on universal design or through user input. This article presents, as a result of our study, a set of customization guidelines for implementing more flexible mobile applications. The guidelines also help to assess the degree of flexibility of existing mobile applications.},

abstract = {Aligning electron density maps from Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a first key step for studying multiple conformations of a biomolecule. As this step remains costly and challenging, with standard alignment tools being potentially stuck in local minima, we propose here a new procedure, called &lt;italic&gt;AlignOT&lt;/italic&gt;, which relies on the use of computational optimal transport (OT) to align EM maps in 3D space. By embedding a fast estimation of OT maps within a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, our method searches for a rotation that minimizes the Wasserstein distance between two maps, represented as point clouds. We quantify the impact of various parameters on the precision and accuracy of the alignment, and show that &lt;italic&gt;AlignOT&lt;/italic&gt; can outperform the standard local alignment methods, with an increased range of rotation angles leading to proper alignment. We further benchmark &lt;italic&gt;AlignOT&lt;/italic&gt; on various pairs of experimental maps, which account for different types of conformational heterogeneities and geometric properties. As our experiments show good performance, we anticipate that our method can be broadly applied to align 3D EM maps.},

abstract = {This article presents a solution that allows utilizing cross-chain payments for any use case. We chose to evaluate it on an apartment booking. Despite this, the solution allows users to rent anything they wish (ranging from power tools to cars or lands) in a decentralized manner through a system designed with the usage of smart contracts, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or applications enhancing this decentralized technology, also known as dApps. Our solution utilizes a Multichain NFT bridge by XP Network that enhances NFT transfers from one chain to another and uses an Axelar GMP protocol to connect Polkadot Parachain called Moonbeam with Ethereum. This allows users to transfer assets from one chain to another. During the design evaluation, we explained the simplicity of design that the solution brings to users planning to utilize their token on the PolkaDot ecosystem or Ethereum in general.},

abstract = {High performance scale-out storage systems are a critical component of modern HPC and AI clusters. However, characterizing their performance remains challenging: Different client I/O patterns have very different performance scaling behavior, and bottlenecks in the HPC storage software may also limit performance scaling. The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) is an open source scale-out storage system that is designed from the ground up to support Storage Class Memory (SCM) and NVMe storage in user space. DAOS has demonstrated leadership performance on IO500. But while IO500 has defined an extensive “standard” set of I/O patterns, a single IO500 run does not provide much insight into how a storage solution scales. This paper investigates the performance scaling behavior of the DAOS storage stack for typical IOR and mdtest workloads, as a function of the storage server hardware and the client-side parallelism. It also analyses the impact of the HPC networking stack (libfabric/verbs and UCX) on the achievable performance.},

abstract = {Traditionally, distributed storage systems have relied upon the interfaces provided by OS kernels to interact with storage hardware. However, much research has shown that OSes impose serious overheads on every I/O operation, especially on high-performance storage and networking hardware (e.g., PMEM and 200GBe). Thus, distributed storage stacks are being re-designed to take advantage of this modern hardware by utilizing new hardware interfaces which bypass the kernel entirely. However, the impact of these optimizations have not been well-studied for real HPC workloads on real hardware. In this work, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of DAOS: a state-of-the-art distributed storage system which re-architects the storage stack from scratch for modern hardware. We compare DAOS against traditional storage stacks and demonstrate that by utilizing optimal interfaces to hardware, performance improvements of up to 6x can be observed in real scientific applications.},

Though uses in many different applications are being found, they still have a problem with the lack of interpretability. This has bread a lack of understanding and trust in the use of DRL solutions from researchers and the general public. To solve this problem, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence has emerged. This entails a variety of different methods that look to open the DRL black boxes, ranging from the use of interpretable symbolic Decision Trees to numerical methods like Shapley Values. This review looks at which methods are being used and for which applications. This is done to identify which models are the best suited to each application or if a method is being underutilised.},

abstract = {Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLN) are utilised for numerous Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IEEE has specified the Time-slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) Media Access Control (MAC) to target the needs of Industrial IoT. TSCH supports deterministic communications over unreliable wireless environments and balances energy, bandwidth and latency. Furthermore, the Minimal 6TiSCH configuration defined Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy networks (RPL) with the Objective Function 0 (OF0). Inherent factors from RPL operation, such as joining procedure, parent switching, and trickle timer fluctuations, may introduce overhead and overload the network with control messages. The application and RPL control data may lead to an unpredicted networking bottleneck, potentially causing network instability. Hence, a stable RPL operation contributes to a healthy TSCH operation. In this paper, we explore TSCH MAC and RPL metrics to identify factors that lead to performance degradation and specify indicators to anticipate network disorders towards increasing Industrial IoT reliability. A TSCH Schedule Function might employ the identified aspects to foresee disturbances, proactively allocate the proper amount of cells, and avoid networking congestion.},

abstract = {Decentralized applications (dApps) consist of smart contracts that run on blockchains and clients that model collaborating parties. dApps are used to model financial and legal business functionality. Today, contracts and clients are written as separate programs—in different programming languages—communicating via send and receive operations. This makes distributed program flow awkward to express and reason about, increasing the potential for mismatches in the client-contract interface, which can be exploited by malicious clients, potentially leading to huge financial losses.In this article, we present Prisma , a language for tierless decentralized applications, where the contract and its clients are defined in one unit and pairs of send and receive actions that “belong together” are encapsulated into a single direct-style operation, which is executed differently by sending and receiving parties. This enables expressing distributed program flow via standard control flow and renders mismatching communication impossible. We prove formally that our compiler preserves program behavior in presence of an attacker controlling the client code. We systematically compare Prisma with mainstream and advanced programming models for dApps and provide empirical evidence for its expressiveness and performance.},

In this complex stack, the definition of an “I/O access pattern” has been reappropriated to describe what an application is doing to write or read data from the perspective of different layers of the stack, often comprising a different set of features. It has become common to have to redefine what is meant when discussing a pattern in every new study, as no assumption can be made. This survey aims to propose a baseline taxonomy, harnessing the I/O community’s knowledge over the past 20 years. This definition can serve as a common ground for high-performance computing I/O researchers and developers to apply known I/O tuning strategies and design new strategies for improving I/O performance. We seek to summarize and bring a consensus to the multiple ways to describe a pattern based on common features already used by the community over the years.},

Large-scale software projects are being assembled by a flexible composition of many (small) components possibly written in different programming languages and deployed anywhere in the cloud – the so-called microservice-based applications. The dramatic growth in popularity of microservice-based applications has pushed several companies to apply major refactorings to their software systems. However, this is a challenging task that may take several months or even years. We propose a methodology to automatically evolve a Java monolithic application into a microservice-based one. Our methodology receives the Java code and a proposition of microservices and refactors the original classes to make each microservice independent. Our methodology creates an API for each method call to classes that are in other services. The database entities are also refactored to be included in the corresponding service. The initial evaluation shows that our tool can successfully refactor 80\% of the applications tested.},

abstract = {In data-intensive workloads, data placement and memory management are inherently difficult: the programmer and the operating system have to choose between (combinations of) DRAM and storage, replacement policies, as well as paging sizes. Efficient memory management is based on fine-grained data access patterns driving placement decisions. Current solutions in this space cannot be applied to general workloads and production systems due to either unrealistic assumptions or prohibitive monitoring overheads.To overcome these issues, we introduce DAOS, an open-source system for general data access-aware memory management. DAOS provides a data access monitoring framework that utilizes practical best-effort trade-offs between overhead and accuracy. The memory management engine of DAOS allows users to implement their access-aware management with no code, just simple configuration schemes. For system administrators, DAOS provides a runtime system that auto-tunes the schemes for user-defined objectives in a finite time. We evaluated DAOS on commercial service production systems as well as state-of-the-art benchmarks. DAOS achieves up to 12\% performance improvement and 91\% memory saving. DAOS is upstreamed and available in the Linux kernel.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been designed to ensure the correctness and integrity of transaction and process management. A ledger maintains records of data transactions as well as assures the correct execution of processes attached to data. Consistency across processes and parties is achieved by means of consensus building. However, scalability is a major concern when and significant amounts of data need confirmation. When digitalizing existing business processes with serious amounts of data, scalability becomes a pivotal objective. Hence, technical means for information compression become a vital asset. This paper presents a novel approach for data aggregation. On the one hand, data are aggregated in order to merely maintain an audit certificate of the aggregate on the ledger. On the other hand, provenance of raw data aggregated can be traced and proven correctly. Hence, audit services for information exchange in business relationships can scale, while raw data of supplier parties must not be unveiled in detail. We present a novel architecture for efficient data aggregation, while ensuring smart contracts and their main functionality of processing relevant process data. German waterway transportation serves as evaluation scenario. Moreover, decentral identity management is introduced as anchor element of our DLT-enabled ecosystem for business collaboration. Hence, preserving sovereignty and safety of personal data can be assured for M2M economies.},
