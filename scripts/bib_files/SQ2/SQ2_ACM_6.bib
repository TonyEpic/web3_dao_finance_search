abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the first installment of the Workshop on Recent Advances in Resilient and Trustworthy ML Systems in Autonomous Networks (ARTMAN), colocated with ACM CCS 2023 in Copenhagen. Thought as a forum to enable the gathering of several research communities covering topics as diverse as cybersecurity, safety, autonomous networking, or machine learning, ARTMAN seeks to push forward the discussion and collaboration between attendees, including both researchers and practitioners. The mission of the symposium is to collectively explore and discuss the topics about resilient and trustworthy autonomous networks, for academic researchers to share their views, experiences, and lessons learned, as well as for industrial practitioners to provide their insights and perspectives. ARTMAN gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to collaboratively close the gap between the actual industry concerns with respect to the resilience and trust of ML systems, and the abundant academic research corpus on adversarial machine learning, in particular for autonomous networks.},

abstract = {Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to enable reliable and efficient transportation systems. Most motion planning algorithms for multi-agent systems are not completely safe because they implicitly assume that all vehicles/agents will execute the expected plan with a small error. This assumption, however, is hard to keep for CAVs since they may have to slow down (e.g., to yield to a jaywalker) or are forced to stop (e.g. break down), sometimes even without a notice. Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) defines a set of safety rules for each driving scenario to ensure that a vehicle will not cause an accident irrespective of other vehicles' behavior. RSS rules, however, are hard to evaluate for merge, intersection, and unstructured road scenarios. In addition, deadlock situations can happen that are not considered by the RSS. In this paper, we propose a generic version of RSS rules for CAVs that can be applied to any driving scenario. We integrate the proposed RSS rules with the CAV's motion planning algorithm to enable cooperative driving of CAVs. Our approach can also detect and resolve deadlocks in a decentralized manner. We have conducted experiments to verify that a CAV does not cause an accident no matter when other CAVs slow down or stop. We also showcase our deadlock detection and resolution mechanism. Finally, we compare the average velocity and fuel consumption of vehicles when they drive autonomously but not connected with the case that they are connected.},

abstract = {Throughout this paper, we try to describe with blockchain technology the decentralization of the internet. A decentralized network that encourages the internet to operate from the smartphone or tablet of anybody instead of centralized servers. A decentralized implementation would be based on a peer-to-peer network that is dependent on a user community. Their machines connected to the internet will host the network, not a community of more powerful servers. Each site would be distributed across thousands of nodes on various devices. The data is therefore not contained, owned by private storage facilities. There is therefore no central point to hack, and no way for an oligarchy of entities to take control of it. A proposed alternative was formed based on a systematic literature review that demonstrates that Internet decentralization is what this modern technology needs in order to address not only the weaknesses of current servers including server down issue, hacking and data manipulation or single point of failure, but also to prevent companies from monetizing the data of citizens through their server and to market them to the advertisers.},

abstract = {The security and usability of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications depend on the secure management of cryptographic keys. However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work we first revisit the problem of threshold ECDSA by considering the commonly admissible 'server-aided' model, namely, the presence of a semi-honest and non-colluding service provider. Then, we leverage that model and consider cases where that 'server' is distributed, introducing the novel concept of unstoppable wallets; hence eliminating any single point of failure. Unstoppable wallets are programmable threshold ECDSA wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We construct highly efficient threshold ECDSA protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security in the server-aided model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority among the signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold ECDSA key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead.We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these protocols, written in a smart contract language, deployed on the Secret Network - a blockchain that plays the role of the server. Using that deployment, we showcase the protocols' applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.},

The article presents two alternative schemes for camera scheduling: Grid-Based Grouping (GBG) and Elevator-Based Planning (EBP). The camera control works with realistic 3D environments and considers many factors, including the direction of the subject’s movement and its location, distances from the cameras, occlusion, overall recognition probability so far, and the expected time to leave the site, as well as the movements of cameras and their capabilities and limitations. In addition, the article utilizes clustering to group subjects, thereby enabling the system to focus on the areas that are more densely populated. Moreover, it proposes a dynamic mechanism for controlling the pre-recording time spent on running the solution. Furthermore, it develops a parallel algorithm, allowing the most time-consuming phases to be parallelized, and thus run efficiently by the centralized parallel processing subsystem. We analyze through simulation the effectiveness of the overall solution, including the clustering approach, scheduling alternatives, dynamic mechanism, and parallel implementation in terms of overall recognition probability and the running time of the solution, considering the impacts of numerous parameters.},

abstract = {IoT systems grow quickly and are massively present in urban areas. Their successful deployment requires autonomy that can be built on automated learning technologies such as Deep Learning. The IoT applications require important computational resources, rarely available on devices. Autonomous IoT systems require the computation power available on the edge and cloud servers in order to offload some tasks related to the supported applications and the underlying platforms. Task offloading constitutes a big challenge in autonomous IoT systems due to the huge number of IoT devices for scenarios of the family of smart cities. Managing task offloading in such contexts requires adaptive strategies capable of taking into consideration the rapid evolution of available resources and proposing efficient offloading solutions to all received requests. In this paper we use a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach capable of handling large state spaces, and resolve the optimization problem in this context, where other techniques can not scale efficiently. Our solution is based on a DRL agent that was developed in the ns3-gym framework and was tested on IoT system scenario implemented in the NS3 simulator. The results obtained show that the DRL agent can adapt quickly to resource evolution in the IoT system and can handle big number of demands fulfilling scalabilty requirements of autonomous IoT systems.},

abstract = {Within the MaidSafe distributed network, users are able to store mutable and immutable data, which will remain accessible on the network in a distributed hash table, essentially forever. This raises an obvious question as to how to restrict malicious parties from making use of excessive network resources, in order to ensure the storage capacity of the network is not quickly depleted by a small number of users making excessive use of storage. Such activity risks preventing legitimate use of the network. This paper explores two possible means of secure storage quota management on such a decentralised network, and presents the concept of manager verification. It then presents a protocol-based solution to allow users to purchase extra storage from other users in a decentralised network, with irrepudiable and non-forgeable agreements, which are verifiable by any third party.},

abstract = {The Decentralised Web (DW) has recently seen a renewed momentum, with a number of DW platforms like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Hubzilla gaining increasing traction. These offer alternatives to traditional social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, by enabling the operation of web infrastructure and services without centralised ownership or control. Although their services differ greatly, modern DW platforms mostly rely on two key innovations: first, their open source software allows anybody to setup independent servers ("instances") that people can sign-up to and use within a local community; and second, they build on top of federation protocols so that instances can mesh together, in a peer-to-peer fashion, to offer a globally integrated platform.In this paper, we present a measurement-driven exploration of these two innovations, using a popular DW microblogging platform (Mastodon) as a case study. We focus on identifying key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to decentralise the web, and empirically highlight a number of properties that are creating natural pressures towards re-centralisation. Finally, our measurements shed light on the behaviour of both administrators (i.e., people setting up instances) and regular users who sign-up to the platforms, also discussing a few techniques that may address some of the issues observed.},

abstract = {Software systems across various application domains are undergoing a major shift, from static systems of systems to dynamic ecosystems characterized by largely autonomous software agents, engaging in mutual coalitions and partnerships to complete complex collaborative tasks. One of the key challenges facing software engineering along with this shift, is our preparedness to leverage the concept of mutual trust building among the dynamic system components, to support safe collaborations with (possibly malicious or misbehaving) components outside the boundaries of our control. To support safe evolution towards dynamic software ecosystems, this paper examines the current progress in the research on trust in software engineering across various application domains. To this end, it presents a survey of existing work in this area, and suggests the directions in which further research is needed. These directions include the research of social metrics supporting trust assessment, fine-grained quantification of trust-assessment results, and opening the discussion on governance mechanisms responsible for trust-score management and propagation across the integrated software ecosystems.},

These vehicles are used for goods delivery tasks between different points of the production system. The coordination is based on a decentralized architecture where each vehicle broadcasts the information about its state in the working environment, and by combining all these states in a local way, each AGV decides which action to take. The heuristic that allows the decentralized traffic control is based on a priority system, based on the current task, and a set of dangerous zones which are defined to avoid possible deadlocks, where mutual exclusion should be ensured. The process is somehow similar to that used by humans when circulating in cars: a set of rules and a set of signals/places. The interaction of many vehicles working on the same area under different collision conditions has been tested in a real industrial warehouse environment.},

However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

abstract = {As one of the most complex parts in manufacturing systems, scheduling plays an important role in the efficient allocation of resources to meet individual customization requirements. However, due to the uncertain disruptions (e.g., task arrival time, service breakdown duration) of manufacturing processes, how to respond to various dynamics in manufacturing to keep the scheduling process moving forward smoothly and efficiently is becoming a major challenge in dynamic manufacturing scheduling. To solve such a problem, a wide spectrum of artificial intelligence techniques have been developed to (1) accurately construct dynamic scheduling models that can represent both personalized customer needs and uncertain provider capabilities and (2) efficiently obtain a qualified schedule within a limited time. From these two perspectives, this article systemically makes a state-of-the-art literature survey on the application of these artificial intelligence techniques in dynamic manufacturing modeling and scheduling. It first introduces two types of dynamic scheduling problems that consider service- and task-related disruptions in the manufacturing process, respectively, followed by a bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence techniques for dynamic manufacturing scheduling. Next, various kinds of artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers for solving dynamic scheduling problems including both directed heuristics and autonomous learning methods are reviewed, which strive not only to quickly obtain optimized solutions but also to effectively achieve the adaption to dynamics. Finally, this article further elaborates on the future opportunities and challenges of using artificial-intelligence-enabled schedulers to solve complex dynamic scheduling problems. In summary, this survey aims to present a thorough and organized overview of artificial-intelligence-enabled dynamic manufacturing scheduling and shed light on some related research directions that are worth studying in the future.},

abstract = {Scalable task allocation in dynamic real-world domains often requires efficient, robust, decentralized, and adaptable approaches. Response threshold reinforcement is a biologically-inspired model of probabilistic action that has been shown to lead to efficient task allocation among swarm agents that do not reason or communicate, making it a highly scalable and low cost solution. The model leads agents to specialize, resulting in reduced costs of interference and task switching, as well as to improved efficiency and adaptability to initially unknown environments. While initial specialization of this and other models is investigated in much of existing literature, subsequent re-adaptation to domain changes is seldom verified. Our goal is to investigate the robustness of response threshold reinforcement to various environmental changes, as well as to compare this model to other decentralized approaches.},

abstract = {Learning consistent policies in decentralized settings is often problematic. The agents have a myopic view of their neighboring states that could lead to inconsistent action choices. The fundamental question addressed in this work is how to determine and obtain the minimal overlapping context among decentralized decision makers required to make their decisions more consistent. Our approach is a two-phased learning process where agents first learn their policies offline within the context of a simplified environment where it is not necessary to know detailed context information about neighbors. These local policies are then applied in more complex "real" environments where it is expected that agents will encounter a much higher rate of inconsistencies (conflicts) with neighborhood actions. When conflicts are observed, agents switch to "special" states that augment local policy states with additional non-local state information and learn other actions to take in this specific situation. This results in action choices that are less likely to lead to conflicts. We evaluate our approach by addressing meta-level decisions in a complex multiagent weather tracking domain. Experimental results show that our approach achieves good performance on utility and conflict resolution by exploring only a small fraction of the whole search space.},

abstract = {There has been substantial progress on algorithms for single-agent sequential decision making using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). A number of efficient algorithms for solving POMDPs share two desirable properties: error-bounds and fast convergence rates. Despite significant efforts, no algorithms for solving decentralized POMDPs benefit from these properties, leading to either poor solution quality or limited scalability. This paper presents the first approach for solving transition independent decentralized Markov decision processes (Dec-MDPs), that inherits these properties. Two related algorithms illustrate this approach. The first recasts the original problem as a deterministic and completely observable Markov decision process. In this form, the original problem is solved by combining heuristic search with constraint optimization to quickly converge into a near-optimal policy. This algorithm also provides the foundation for the first algorithm for solving infinite-horizon transition independent decentralized MDPs. We demonstrate that both methods outperform state-of-the-art algorithms by multiple orders of magnitude, and for infinite-horizon decentralized MDPs, the algorithm is able to construct more concise policies by searching cyclic policy graphs.},

abstract = {In recent years, Autonomous Vehicle Networks (AVNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to make transportation safer and more efficient. These networks rely on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication to exchange critical information, such as location, speed, and driving intentions. However, V2V communication also introduces security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the safety and privacy of drivers and passengers. Malicious or selfish drivers can potentially intercept, modify, and manipulate V2V communication, causing confusion among vehicles or stealing sensitive data. Therefore, in order to identify and mitigate security threats that could jeopardize V2V communication in AVNs, the implementation of a threat prevention framework is imperative. This paper presents a threat prevention framework that assesses security risks dynamically to facilitate secure message forwarding in V2V communication. First, we propose a dynamic risk assessment technique that utilizes the PIER approach to evaluate the level of security threats posed to V2V communication, and ultimately generate a risk score. Second, we develop a security decay assessment method that utilizes ruin theory to continuously monitor security risk within the AVNs. Third, we design a risk-aware message forwarding protocol based on coalitional game theory to facilitate secure V2V communication. Our experiments using the simulator Veins demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework in preventing potential damage caused by common security threats and enhancing the security of the Automated Highway System (AHS).},

abstract = {Resource pools are collections of computational resources (e.g., servers) which can be used by different applications in a shared way. A crucial aspect in these pools is to allocate resources so as to ensure their proper usage, taking into account workload and specific requirements of each application. An interesting approach, in this context, is to allocate the resources in the best possible way, aiming at optimal resource usage. Workload, however, varies over time, and in turn, resource demands will vary too. To ensure that optimal resource usage is always in place, resource shares should be defined dynamically and over time. It has been claimed that utility functions are the main tool for enabling such self-optimizing behavior. Whereas many solutions with this characteristic have been proposed to date, none of them presents true decentralization within the context of shared pools. In this article, we then propose a decentralized model for optimal resource usage in shared resource pools, providing practical and theoretical evidence of its feasibility.},

abstract = {The principles of the Artificial Immune System (AIS) have been applied to a wide range of applications including that of robotics. Most of the research carried out so far has been based on either of the two prominent AIS models viz. the Clonal selection model and the Idiotypic model. In this paper we present an AIS based mechanism for the navigation of an autonomous mobile robot by blending both these models. This hybrid mechanism was tested on a real robot situated in an unknown environment comprising obstacles and unfavourable conditions. The main objective of the robot was to discover safe zones within the environment. An inherent pain is generated within the robot as and when it encounters unfavorable situation. The AIS within the robot uses the values reported by the on-board sensors as an antigen and the reduction in pain as a reward to generate a repertoire of antibodies or actions using the Clonal Selection model. These learned antibodies form an Idiotypic network which triggers the appropriate antibodies on-demand to facilitate navigation towards the goal. The results obtained in different test cases suggest that the proposed model is viable and able to cope up with different environmental conditions.},

As a consequence, these have found their way into numerous applications including in the space and aerospace domains like swarm-based asteroid observation or counter-drone systems. However, achieving stable formations around a point of interest using different number of robots and diverse initial conditions can be challenging. In this article we propose a novel method for autonomous robots swarms self-organisation solely relying on their relative position (angle and distance). This work focuses on an evolutionary optimisation approach to calculate the parameters of the swarm, e.g. inter-robot distance, to achieve a reliable formation under different initial conditions. Experiments are conducted using realistic simulations and considering four case studies. The results observed after testing the optimal configurations on 72 unseen scenarios per case study showed the high robustness of our proposal since the desired formation was always achieved. The ability of self-organise around a point of interest maintaining a predefined fixed distance was also validated using real robots.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe and evaluate a fully distributed P2P evolutionary algorithm (EA) with adaptive autonomous selection. Autonomous selection means that decisions regarding survival and reproduction are taken by the individuals themselves independently, without any central control.This allows for a fully distributed EA, where not only reproduction (crossover and mutation) but also selection is performed at local level. An unwanted consequence of adding and removing individuals in a non-synchronized manner is that the population size gets out of control too. This problem is resolved by addingan adaptation mechanism allowing individuals to regulate their own selection pressure. The key tothis is a gossiping algorithm that enables individuals to maintain estimates on the size andthe fitness of the population. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated on a test problem to show the viability of the idea and to gain insight into the run-time dynamics of such an algorithm. The results convincingly demonstrate the feasibility of a fully decentralized EA in which the population size can be kept stable.},

abstract = {This paper examines a method of clustering within a fully decentralized multi-agent system. Our goal is to group agents with similar objectives or data, as is done in traditional clustering. However, we add the additional constraint that agents must remain in place on a network, instead of first being collected into a centralized database. To do this we connect agents in a random network and have them search in a peer-to-peer fashion for other similar agents. We thus aim to tackle the basic clustering problem on an Internet scale and create a method by which agents themselves can be grouped, forming coalitions. In order to investigate the feasibility of a decentralized approach, this paper presents a number of simulation experiments involving agents representing two-dimensional points. A comparison between our method's clustering ability and that of the k-means clustering algorithm is presented. Generated data sets containing 2,500 to 160,000 points (agents) grouped in 25 to 1,600 clusters are examined. Results show that our decentralized agent method produces a better clustering than the centralized k-means algorithm, quickly placing 95\% to 99\% of points correctly. The the time required to find a clustering depends on the quality of solution required; a fairly good solution is quickly converged on, and then slowly improved. Overall, our experiments indicate that the time to find a particular quality of solution increases less than linearly with the number of agents.},

The approach proposed in this project goes beyond previous works on stream reasoning, enabling the self-organization and coordination among distributed stream reasoners, based on techniques and principles inspired by Multi-Agent systems. On the one hand, it adds the ability to explicate processing goals, capabilities and knowledge, while on the other it exploits potential ways of interconnecting them in ways that expand their combined capacity/efficacy for managing highly dynamic flows of streaming knowledge. Through this approach, efficient local stream processors can establish cooperative processing schemes, respecting data privacy restrictions and data locality requirements through the exchange of streaming Knowledge Graphs.},

abstract = {Waiting in a long queue at traffic lights not only wastes valuable time but also pollutes the environment. With the advances in autonomous vehicles and 5G networks, the previous jamming scenarios at intersections may be turned into non-stop weaving traffic flows. Toward this vision, we propose a highly efficient traffic planning system, namely DASHX, which enables connected autonomous vehicles to cross multi-way intersections without a stop. Specifically, DASHX has a comprehensive model to represent intersections and vehicle status. It can constantly process large volumes of vehicle information, resolve scheduling conflicts, and generate optimal travel plans for all vehicles coming toward the intersection in real time. Unlike existing works that are limited to certain types of intersections and lack considerations of practicability, DASHX is universal for any type of 3D intersection and yields the near-maximum throughput while still ensuring riding comfort. To better evaluate the effectiveness of traffic scheduling systems in real-world scenarios, we developed a sophisticated open source 3D traffic simulation platform (DASHX-SIM) that can handle complicated 3D road layouts and simulate vehicles’ networking and decision-making processes. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the DASHX system and the simulator.},

Collaborating UAVs in a team form a Self-Managed Cell (SMC) with at least one commander. UAVs in an SMC may need to operate independently or in sub-groups, out of contact with the commander and the rest of the team in order to perform specific tasks, but must still be able to eventually synchronise state information. The SMC must also cope with intermittent and permanent communication failures as well permanent UAV failures. This paper describes a failure management scheme that copes with both communication link and UAV failures, which may result in temporary disjoint sub-networks within the SMC. A communication management protocol is proposed to control UAVs performing disconnected individual operations, while maintaining the SMC's structure by trying to ensure that all members of the mission regardless of destination or task, can communicate by moving UAVs to act as relays or by allowing the UAVs to rendezvous at intermittent intervals.},

Traditionally, the AGVs that execute the transportation tasks are controlled by a central server via wireless communication. In a joint effort between Egemin, an industrial manufacturer of AGV transportation systems, and DistriNet Labs research at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, we developed an innovative decentralized architecture for controlling AGVs. The driving motivations behind decentralizing the control of AGVs were new and future quality requirements such as flexibility and openness. At the software architectural level, the AGV control system is structured as a multi-agent system; the detailed design and implementation is object-oriented. In this paper, we report our experiences with developing the agent-based control system for AGVs. Starting from system requirements, we give an overview of the software architecture and we zoom in on a number of concrete functionalities. We reflect on our experiences and report lessons learned from applying multi-agent systems for real-world AGV control.},

We call upon the scientific community to put our talents to this challenge by creating decentralised infrastructures for trust-based economic and social cooperation. We empirically demonstrate that a public infrastructure to establish trust between peers in decentralized networks is possible at significant scale. Our work is based on over 15 years of improving our distributed systems which were used by more than a million people. We present six stringent criteria for designing trustworthy infrastructure, called zero-server architecture. Adhering to these principles, we designed a novel trustworthy networking infrastructure, called P2P-Apps. It enables smartphone apps to communicate without any servers, by forming a scalable overlay that uses our generic mechanism to build trust between peers, Trustchain. P2P-Apps are generic and can be expanded to serve as an alternative to centralized infrastructure owned by Big Tech.},

abstract = {In the digital age, where health data and digital lives converge, data privacy and control are crucial. The advent of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) brings advanced data analysis and healthcare predictions, but also privacy concerns. The ESPRESSO project 1 asserts that for AI to be trustworthy and effective in healthcare, it must prioritize user control over corporate interests. The shift towards decentralized personal online datastores (pods) and Solid 2 principles represents a new era of private, controllable Web interactions, balancing AI data protection and machine intelligence. This balance is particularly important for applications involving health data. However, decentralization poses challenges, particularly in secure, efficient data search and data retrieval, that need to be addressed first. We argue that a decentralized search system that provides a large-scale search across Solid pods, while considering data owners' control of their data and users' different access rights, is crucial for this new paradigm. In this paper, we describe how our current decentralized search system's prototype (ESPRESSO) helps to query structured and unstructured personal health data in Solid servers. The paper also describes a search scenario that shows how ESPRESSO can search health data combined with fitness personal data stored in different personal datastores},

In a joint R&amp;D project, Egemin and the AgentWise research group are developing an innovative version of the E'GVs control system aimed to cope with new and future system requirements such as flexibility and openness.In this project, we exploit principles and mechanisms known from situated multi-agent systems for modelling and implementing a decentralized control system. Instead of a centralistic approach, where one computer system is in charge of numerous complex and time-consuming tasks (such as routing, collision avoidance, deadlock avoidance, etc.), we aim to provide the E'GVs with a considerable amount of autonomy. This allows to obtain a system that is far more flexible than the current software - the E'GVs adapt themselves to the current situation in their direct vicinity, order assignment is dynamic, the system can cope with E'GVs leaving the system (e.g. for maintenance) or adding new E'GVs, and so on.In this paper, we describe the architecture that is employed for implementing the control of the E'GV system. The implementation of the control software seamlessly integrates with E'nsor, the low-level vehicle control system. We illustrate a concrete control scenario in which two E'GVs coordinate their behavior to avoid collisions.},

abstract = {"Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime" -- Lau Tzu Large-scale grid computing projects such as TeraGrid and Open Science Grid provide researchers vast amounts of compute resources but with requirements that could limit access, results delayed due to potentially long job queues, and environments and policies that might affect a user's work flow. In many scenarios and in particular with the advent of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud computing, individual users and communities can benefit from less restrictive, dynamic systems that include a combination of local resources and on-demand resources provisioned by one or more IaaS provider. These types of scenarios benefit from flexibility in deploying resources, remote access, and environment configuration.In this paper, we address how small groups can dynamically create, join, and manage grid infrastructures with low administrative overhead. Our work distinguishes itself from other projects with similar objects by enabling a combination of decentralized system organization and user access for job submission in addition to a web 2.0 interfaces for managing grid membership and automate certificate management. These components contribute to the design of the "Grid Appliance," an implementation of a wide area overlay network of virtual workstations (WOW), which has developed over the past six years into a mature system with several deployments and many users. In addition to an architectural description, this paper contains lessons learned during the development and deployment of "Grid Appliance" systems and a case study backed by quantitative analysis that verifies the utility of our approach.},

Unfortunately, computing optimal plans in a DEC-POMDP has been shown to be intractable (NEXP-complete), and approximate algorithms for specific subclasses have been proposed. Many of these algorithms rely on an (approximate) solution of the centralized planning problem (i.e., treating the whole team as a single agent). We take a more decentralized approach, in which each agent only reasons over its own local state and some uncontrollable state features, which are shared by all team members. In contrast to other approaches, we model communication as an integral part of the agent's reasoning, in which the meaning of a message is directly encoded in the policy of the communicating agent. We explore iterative methods for approximately solving such models, and we conclude with some encouraging preliminary experimental results.},

abstract = {Decentralized enactment of workflows is generally advocated for data intensive scientific applications. This approach offers a number of advantages including avoiding a single (centralized) point of failure, and associated (centralized) performance bottlenecks. However, such services are often assumed to be openly available with little or no security. This is increasingly not the case. Instead organizations and the services they offer require autonomous ways of defining and enforcing their own access control policies supporting fine-grained authorization. Tackling such scenarios raises many issues regarding workflow definition, enactment and potential re-enactment. This research explores the issues related to security-oriented decentralized workflow definition and enactment. The solution is respectful of the need for autonomy of service providers and allows each participating service to define their own access control policies. We also show how different security delivery models can be supported leveraging the pulling and pushing of security credentials.},

Since 2020, DeFi has started to develop in the cryptocurrency markets. Then, with the increase in popularity of digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and with the launch of the Metaverse, DeFi has been introduced into the Social environment by the combination of social networking and finance in the blockchain. This new shape of DeFi has been called Social Finance (SocialFi). SocialFi can be seen as the social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing to get monetary benefits from being part of SocialFi platforms. In detail, SocialFi has a special feature that is decentralized, open and user-controlled, and it started to be adopted by the communities. The main component of SocialFi is the Social token used to reward people.

abstract = {Fundamental challenges in designing environments with media-rich ambient services involves not only the development of appropriate sensing technologies, but as importantly, the implementation of a distributed media processing system which can process, integrate, and leverage the sensed data in real time to provide the various services. In recent years, a great deal of progress has been made in media service workflow processing systems. In most existing solutions, however, the workflow nodes, which operate on the data, are selected out of a centrally assigned candidate pool. These candidate organizations cause either extensive resource provisioning or poor-quality operator mapping between logical workflow nodes and the available physical resources nodes. Consequently, instantiating a media processing workflow to the underlying hardware before the workflow execution begins does not lends itself to adaptive and autonomous operation of the workflow, scalable to resources and demand.In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized multimedia workflow processing system, DANS, in which operators defined in workflows are mapped into (distributed) physical nodes through Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based overlay substrate in a purely decentralized and adaptive manner. The redundancy in the system, in terms of availability of multiple nodes able to perform the same task, enables the system to scale with demand. Furthermore, physical workflow nodes (operator instances) are able to locate and select the next filter or fusion operator instance autonomously, while ensuring the correct execution of the workflow.},

Moreover, existing approaches can not be used for real applications because they do not take into account complex constraints about the execution. In this paper, we present a class of DEC-MDPs, OC-DEC-MDP, that can handle temporal and precedence constraints. This model allows several autonomous agents to cooperate so as to complete a set of tasks without communication. In order to allow the agents to coordinate, we introduce an opportunity cost. Each agent builds its own local MDP independently of the other agents but, it takes into account the lost in value provoked, by its local decision, on the other agents. Existing approaches solving DEC-MDP are NEXP complete or exponential, while our OC-DEC-MDP can be solved by a polynomial algorithm with good approximation.},

We propose the use of autonomous robots that move inside a disaster area and establish a network for two-way communication between trapped civilians with uncertain locations and an operation centre. Our aim is to maximise the number of civilians connected to the network. We present a distributed algorithm which involves clustering possible locations of civilians according to their expected shortfall; clustering facilitates both connectivity within groups of civilians and exploration that is based on the uncertainty of these locations. To achieve efficient allocation in terms of time and energy, we also develop a modified algorithm according to which the robots consider the graph that the cluster centres form and follow its minimum spanning tree. We conduct simulations and discuss the efficiency and appropriateness of the two algorithms in different situations.},
