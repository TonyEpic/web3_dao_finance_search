  abstract={In HPC I/O middleware like the Adaptable I/O System (ADIOS) often mediates data transfers between applications. The metadata I/O generated by such systems often presents significant scaling and performance limitations. This work seeks improvement opportunities for metadata I/O by leveraging the DAOS storage systems, a recent storage system solution deployed on high-end systems such as the Aurora supercomputer. We investigate the tradeoffs and the design space for integrating I/O engines for the ADIOS middleware based on the different storage mechanisms supported by DAOS. We present a new DAOS-Array-ChunkSize-aligned engine which provides up to $\mathbf{2}.\mathbf{3}\times$ improved performance than when using the existing DAOS-POSIX interface, without requiring any application modifications.},

  abstract={In the early stage of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) technology, only radio frequency interference that affects radio communication and broadcasting was considered. With the expansion of the range of interference sources and the increase of electromagnetic energy application forms, electromagnetic interference is no longer limited to radiation, but also electromagnetic interference caused by induction, coupling, and conduction should be considered. With the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment in which electronic measuring instruments work, they also put forward higher and higher requirements for electromagnetic compatibility. This paper focuses on the EMC structural design of the vector network analyzer from two aspects of shielding and grounding, and verifies the rationality of the EMC structural design of the vector network analyzer through experiments.},

  abstract={In this paper, a design of frequency reconfigurable SIW-cavity-based antenna is introduced with MIMO mechanism for various wireless applications. The antenna exhibits frequency reconfigurability, compactness, and low profile thanks to quarter-mode SIW design and integration of the varactor diodes. The prototype can scan the frequency from 2.35 GHz to 2.55 GHz by tuning the voltage applied at varactor. The radiation characteristics show high gain and good patterns across the bandwidth (below -15 dB). Additionally, the MIMO design demonstrates negligible reflection and mutual coupling magnitude while MIMO parameters are satisfied. The good agreement between measured and simulated results validates the suitability of the proposed antenna for various MIMO applications in ISM band.},

  year={2024},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={415-428},
  abstract={Computed tomography (CT) images are often corrupted by undesirable artifacts due to the presence of metallic implants, creating the problem of metal artifact reduction (MAR). Existing deep learning-based efforts of tackling this problem share two main common limitations, limiting their practical applications. Firstly, single domain knowledge is insufficient for MAR task, since image domain networks ignore the consistency constraint, while sinogram (X-ray projection) domain networks inevitably result in severe secondary artifacts. Secondly, dual domain networks which overcome this issue by jointly training subnetworks in both domains occupy more GPU memory during training due to joint training nature of their subnetworks. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual domain MAR framework that couples model- and data-driven networks. The proposed coupling strategy can help save GPU memory during training and enables the utilization of complementary network architectures. Specifically, we build a tight frame-based model-driven image domain subnetwork via encoding the non-local repetitive streaking patterns of metal artifacts as an explicit tight frame sparse representation model, while elaborate a transformer-based data-driven sinogram domain subnetwork. These two constructed subnetworks are coupled and trained separately to save GPU memory. To link the sinogram and image domains, we elaborate a prior artifact-attention threshold generating (PATG) module, which passes sinogram domain information to the image domain. The PATG module adaptively rescales multiple prior metal artifacts by taking into account the interdependencies among these artifacts. Extensive experiments on synthesized and clinical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art MAR methods by a large margin in terms of artifact reduction accuracy.},

  abstract={Realizing the full potential of mm-Wave 5G and beyond communication systems will require transistors with higher linearity and efficiency than current technology options. While GaN HEMTs offer excellent power density, their limited linearity and efficiency, especially under complex modulations, compromises overall system performance and requires substantial digital pre-distortion compensation as well as substantial power back-off. Here, we report the large-signal, two-tone linearity of graded-channel GaN HEMTs at 30 GHz, and compare their performance to that of conventional AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. In class AB bias, a two-tone P AE of 62% was obtained experimentally, which is a state-of-the-art result. We find that ~3 dB back-off from peak P AE is sufficient to achieve a carrier to third-order intermodulation (C/IM3) ratio of 30 dBc. Further, the efficiency under this back-off condition provides an associated P AE of 55% at 30 GHz. Hence, the GaN HEMTs are promising for mm-wave linear and efficient amplifiers, including 5G applications.},

  abstract={A recently modern stochastic optimization algorithm has been developed by observing the life of slime mold physarum polycephalum in nature. The algorithm is called the slime mold algorithm (SMA) with an excellent exploratory capacity and exploitation inclination. Still, slipping into optimal local is easy to happen and slowly converges speed while dealing with complicated problems. This article proposes a new process of improving SMA (namely ISMA) by adapting the weight coefficient and cooperating the reverse learning strategy in the expression of agents updating locations to enhance the algorithm’s optimization performance. Many selected benchmark functions and the optimal operation of cascade reservoirs are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Comparisons of the proposed approach’s results with the various algorithms under the case situations show that the recommended solution produces better performance than the different competing algorithms.},

This algorithm exploits a symmetric segmentation approach to partition the input data into the blocks for processing. And this approach can optimize the GPU memory access and minimize the branch divergence of the warp. In addition, a zero-padding method, extending the length of the short time-domain coefficients of the FIR filter to the best size which the FFT library running on the GPU can obtain the best performance, is utilized to improve the algorithm's performance gain for the short tap length of the FIR filter. The throughput of this algorithm can achieve over 600M samples per second throughput for the host-memory to host-memory on the NVIDIA Tesla M2090 with typical performance improvements of 4 to 6 times over Intel IPP for large chunk size.},

  abstract={Isolating code that deals with system infrastructure from code that deals with domain rules is a good practice when developing applications. Code that deals with the database, for example, is often isolated in classes following a Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. Developers often create a DAO for each domain entity in the system. However, as some pieces of code deal with more than one entity/table, developers need to decide in which DAO they will place the code, and sometimes choose a less intuitive location. In this paper, we present a heuristic to identify methods that may have been written in an ambiguous place. To validate the idea, we tested it on three industrial projects from a Brazilian company. The heuristic selected, on average, 13% to 18% of the methods in DAOs. After evaluating such methods, we concluded that the heuristic was correct in 50% to 75% of cases. Therefore, we believe that the heuristic can indicate possible technical debt, where the developers may inspect and possibly refactor.},

Instead of using the classic Steinmetz Saturation Transformer Model as in previous study, the Jiles-Atherton model is applied which has the capability of representing minor loop operations and de-energization. Its parameters are evaluated by a series of differential evaluation algorithm with a few reasonable assumptions. Simulations of inrush current are carried out and the results compared with the experimental measurements.

  abstract={Intelligent Vehicles (IVs), integrating sensing, communication, and computing technologies, have immense potential to elevate efficiency, reduce traffic accidents, and diminish emissions. However, since faulty decisions made by IVs may endanger the safety of people's lives and property, improper trust in these automated systems could potentially lead to significant risks and problems. The trust issues in IVs stems not only from technological immaturity but also from the inability of automation systems to handle complex social relationships. TRUE Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), underpinned by blockchain and smart contracts, propose a code-governed, trustworthy human-machine collaboration model, offering a promising approach to tackle those challenges. This paper introduces TAOs into IVs to propose an innovative human-machine collaboration system namely IV-TAOs, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness between humans and IVs. The architecture of IV-TAOs is formulated, with an exploration of both their characteristics and associated risk issues.

  abstract={The rise of Artificial Intelligence for Science (AI4S) has highlighted the importance and urgency of ensuring open-ness, fairness, impartiality, diversity, and sustainability in scientific systems. Existing scientific systems, referred to as Centralized Science (CeSci), are built on centralized organizational structures and top-down institutional frameworks, which are lagging behind the development and practical requirements of AI4S. To address these limitations, AI4S needs to embrace a new scientific organizational and operational paradigm, namely Decentralized Science (DeSci). It can provide strong support to AI4S via effectively addressing issues such as information silos, biases, unfair distribution, and monopolies and promoting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans disciplinary cooperation in science. Based on these considerations, this paper presents the framework of AI4S based on DeSci and explores its potential application scenarios and research issues. The research can provide effective guidance for the development of scientific systems.},

  abstract={This work presents an algorithm that can monitor the environment frequently, informing of sudden changes in the data and warn of over-threshold of data, while reducing data transfer to the sink node in order to reduce energy consumption. In the experiments executed, the results show that monitoring, informing and warning networks are worked completely when this algorithm is embedded for sensor nodes of wireless sensor networks respectively. Producing experiments measuring water level and temperature via a wireless sensor network, the received results show that the information at sink node including usual environment data, sudden changing environment data and data-overflow of pre-defined threshold is preserved. Using this algorithm the numbers of total sensed data which are sent to the sink node are decreased, and the energy consumption of sensor nodes is saved effectively. The sensor node saves energy, thus the lifetime of whole network is prolonged.},

  pages={1547-1554},
  abstract={Implementing the persistence layer is a task that the Object Relational Mapping (ORMs) tools have standardized through diverse frameworks and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, these ORMs and APIs have some inconveniences related to their configuration process and the time and effort it takes to learn them, amongst others. For example, every time a database is used, a configuration process is realized to map the database to obtain Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and Data Access Objects (DAOs). In order to overcome those disadvantages, this work contributes by proposing a reusable and extensible process that supports the automatic generation of POJOs and DAOs from database scheme metadata, through the specification of an Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF) grammar. A tool named GenPOJO was developed in order to test the process. Unlike the existing ORMs, the proposed process does not require the configuration steps for each database. In addition, GenPOJO does not require time to learn since the only input it receives is a file in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format containing the database scheme metadata.},

  abstract={Even though the RNN, LSTM, and other networks are used to extract dependencies in time series, sensor-based human behavior recognition (HAR) still faces some difficulties, and the ability of deep learning (DL) networks to extract features still needs to be improved. We propose a fusion neural network in which an optimized small optimized Convolutional Block Attention Module (MP-CBAM) is suitable for HAR tasks to extract samples. The MP-CBAM is added to two branches Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with different convolution kernel sizes, and the fused features are labeled with GRU for temporal dependence. Then the softmax function is used for classification. We validate on benchmark datasets UCI-HAR and WISDM and accuracies of 97.15% and 9S.9S% are obtained, respectively, demonstrating the adaptation of our framework to both single-sensor and multi-sensor devices.},

  abstract={Nowadays, data has become more and more important. Most governments have passed laws to control how they are owned and used, such as the GDPR in Europe. However, any law is never perfect. We can see it when a company scattered around the world is hampered by the fact of not being able to exploit customer data outside the borders of a territory. Also, we can add that a data owner is not anymore once he sells them to a third party to be exploited. In this work, we propose a solution based on a permissioned blockchain, namely the Hyperledger Fabric, to allow any stakeholder with data to take part, with value providers, in creating Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAOs). Once created, a DAO can attract other investors to expand it. The Hyperledger Fabric handles this whole process through channels. The infrastructure needed to run the business of the DAO is generated automatically through special transactions taking place at the blockchain level. In the opposite direction, the cloud infrastructure sends notifications to the Hyperledger for traceability and monitoring purposes. Finally, through simulations of wealth distribution models, we show that to keep control of a DAO based on the proposed architecture, the shares must be negotiated according to a Pareto law.},

  abstract={Driven by the development of blockchain infrastructures and the promotion of Web 3, more than 4000 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been developed as online organizations jointly owned and managed by their members who work for the same interests. Voting mechanisms as the democratic administration of DAOs without the involvement of central authority, are crucial to both the development of the DAO community and the protection of individual interests. This paper is one of the first analyses of the critical role of voting mechanisms in DAOs’ operation. In the absence of systematic studies of voting mechanisms in DAOs, we propose five tiers of decentralization in DAO voting which marks the critical difference between DAO voting and conventional voting. We also define four dimensions to comprehensively evaluate the performance of DAO voting mechanisms, which identify the demands and characteristics of DAO voting and put forward clear design guidelines for voting mechanisms in DAOs. Finally, we take seven typical voting mechanisms as examples and analyze their performance in our proposed evaluation schemes.},

  abstract={The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is the regulating authority over the monies that U.S. citizens are allowed to give to political candidates and parties. However, preexisting loopholes in FEC regulation allow for contributions to be made in situations that do not require donors to disclose their identity, a term coined as “dark money”. The increase of dark money in campaign financing and the ability of political spending to influence voter perspectives and decisions puts the credibility of the political finance system at stake. Additionally, with the introduction of blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts to political financing these technologies collectively can serve as a new vehicle for bad actors to use. In this paper, the effects of blockchain and smart contracts on political finance are examined through four use cases to demonstrate how these technologies can extend anonymous, foreign interference in political campaign financing and further cripple public trust in it.},

  abstract={Modern public and private infrastructure is increasingly large and complex regardless of the industry within which it is deployed - communications, power, transportation, manufacturing, finance, etc. Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADSs) analogous to living systems with autonomous and decentralized subsystems have been developed to support the requirements of modern infrastructure. Large-scale infrastructure is increasingly a significant source of data on both its own operations as well as the society dependent on it. Big data from infrastructure can thus supply a variety of artificial and augmented intelligence systems. Large complex infrastructures typically require large complex organizations to operate and maintain. Such organizations though are typically centralized and constrained by bureaucratic policies and procedures. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are emerging that may provide better transparency, autonomy and decentralization for the manner in which these large-scale infrastructures are operated. The paper contrasts DAOs and ADSs before identifying the requirements for DAO administration of an ADS.},

  abstract={Network traffic management is crucial in Computer Networks and the Internet of Things. Indeed, classifying network traffic is the foundation for enhancing the quality of management mechanisms. However, traditional traffic classification methods, such as port-based, deep packet inspection, and statistic-based, are limited in identifying new encrypted traffic characteristics. Deep Learning-based classification approaches that consider packet-based features have been explored to address this challenge. Along with other deep learning methods, Transfer Learning, where a new model can inherit knowledge previously learned by a base model, is commonly used to increase classification performance in low data resources. Unfortunately, feature transferability may decline in transfer learning. This paper proposes an encrypted traffic classification mechanism that leverages the Deep Adaptation Network architecture with Mean Embedding Test to overcome this limitation. Our experimental results show that the proposed mechanism surpasses existing benchmarks’ accuracy and can classify encrypted traffic in real-time.},

  abstract={Access to medical care and health screenings is a necessity for patients around the globe, but it can be difficult to provide this without screenings becoming costly or convoluted for people in low income communities. In rural and underdeveloped areas, patients are often disadvantaged when it comes to finding reliable and affordable healthcare. The isolation provided by their location and the rising costs of physicians makes it difficult for most impoverished communities to attain personalized care. Because of this, treatable diseases, such as chronic kidney disease, often go unaddressed, allowing diseases to progress to a critical condition. Mortality rates have shown to be higher in communities located in rural areas and among destitute economies. Telemedicine is one solution to improve rural health care by allowing patients to have remote access to health services. Due to the preventable nature of these diseases as well as their easily detectable biomarkers, we have created a device to diagnose and record patients' health using commercially available and our own developed strips with a sample of urine. Our goal for this project is to provide simple and fast diagnosis to detect albumin, urobilinogen, nitrite, as well as pH and glucose levels in urine combined with telemedicine to provide reliable results.},

The proposed bidirectional quasisingle-stage push-pull forward high frequency link inverter consists of a push-pull forward converter, a bidirectional active rectifier, an active clamp branch and a SPWM inverter bridge, and can get a good static performance. To achieve good dynamic response, an output voltage double closed-loop feedback is applied to the whole system. Another unique aspect of the design is the use of the TMS320LF2407A DSP and EPM7128 CPLD to control the inverter system. Theoretical analysis and experimental results referring to a laboratory prototype (1 kW) indicate that the proposed topology and control scheme are promising for the applications of DC/AC power source.},

This paper presents the properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) films and high efficiency of p-i-n solar cells prepared using RF (27.1 MHz) excitation frequency. The influence of the power (10-40 W) and pressure (20-50 Pa) used during the deposition of absorber layers in p-i-n solar cells using pure silane on the properties of the films and solar cells are investigated. We summarize the power and pressure effect on properties and growth mechanism of a-Si:H films. It was found that the a-Si:H films prepared under various deposition conditions show widely various deposition rate, optical-electronic properties and microstructure. AZO films between two layers (n-layer and metal), the AZO back reflector was successfully implemented in a-Si:H singlejunction solar cells. After optimizing the deposition parameters, the amorphous silicon based thin film silicon solar cells with efficiency of 9.15 % have been fabricated by HF-PECVD. These are very encouraging results for future fabrication of high efficiency thin film solar cells using by HF-PECVD.},

The success of integrating Single Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV) into Network Function Virtualization (NFV) on VMs has motivated our research into using SR-IOV in CNF, in order to address the strict network demands. When applied to the Charging Function (CHF) in the Cloud-native 5G architecture, our solution resulted in a 30% increase in network throughput, compared to the Kubernetes deployment using Calico. Therefore, SR-IOV and CPU-Pinning have shown potential in optimizing the performance of Cloud-native container-based applications.},

  abstract={Thermal stress of the power semiconductor is one of the most important indicators for the reliability assessment of power electronics-based power systems. The mapping of the Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) junction temperature is usually required to analyze the thermal stress and loss dissipation. However, it is difficult to identify inherent mechanisms of the bond-wire and solder layer failure modes in IGBT power modules. In order to solve the problem, an online method to identify inherent mechanisms of the bond-wire and solder layer failure modes in IGBT power modules is proposed. This method can separate the root causes of the bond-wire lift-off and solder layer fatigue by measuring the on-state voltage drop through a sinusoidal loading current based on an H-bridge circuit, together with its corresponding control and measurement. By comparing the on-state voltage drop at the intersection current and the peak current of the converter, the wear-out conditions of the IGBT power modules can be monitored in real-time with the determination of different failure modes. Finally, experimental results are presented in order to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Smart cities have emerged as one of the most promising applications of cyber-physical systems (CPS), carrying the potential to serve the various interests of the public and private sectors at large. However, contemporary smart city infrastructure commonly uses heavily-centralized network architectures, reducing failure resilience and application flexibility. This centralization also imposes high barriers to entry for public access, limiting usage and oversight opportunities. To address these limitations, we describe Arbiter, a novel fog- and edge-based communication architecture based on the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Arbiter aims to improve the socioeconomic equity of the local citizenry by (1) acting as a management layer for citywide CPS assets, (2) providing a compliance layer for managing human capital, and (3) offering a data protection layer to ensure that citizens retain full control of their personal data. We then analyze in detail the technical, socioeconomic, and ethical implications of Arbiter, and contextualize its role in the modern smart city.},

With introduction of SH (Struts + Hibernate) middleware, the advantages of SH in J2EE software development are analyzed, and a feasible B/S software architecture is proposed in this paper. The interface coupling between different layers of software architecture reduces the influence on the whole software system caused by the change of certain layer. At presentation layer, utilizing Struts2 frame can separate the display and control at the data layer. Therefore, the mapping between the object and the relation is realized with the use of Hibernate3 framework. In order to manage Hibernate systematically and to provide services for DAO, it is necessary to design Hibernate management tool class. In such framework, POJO is always used as a transfer parameter between different layers from the front stage JSP to the back stage Hibernate. It encapsulates the client data at presentation layer and maps the database table at the data layer.},

  abstract={The cosmological luminosity–distance can be measured from gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, free of astronomical distance ladders, and the associated systematics. However, it may still contain systematics arising from various astrophysical, cosmological, and experimental sources. With the large amount of dark standard sirens of upcoming third generation GW experiments, such potential systematic bias, can be diagnosed and corrected by statistical tools of the large-scale structure of the universe. We estimate that, by cross-correlating the dark siren luminosity–distance space distribution and galaxy redshift space distribution, multiplicative error m in the luminosity distance measurement can be constrained with 1σ uncertainty σm ∼ 0.1. This is already able to distinguish some binary black hole origin scenarios unambiguously. Significantly better constraints and therefore more applications may be achieved by more advanced GW experiments.},

  abstract={Over the past decades, augmented reality (AR) has seen vast improvements in graphic displays and mobile tracking capabilities. To our knowledge, handheld AR researcher in text legibility has mostly focused on algorithms for overlaying screen-aligned annotations; no one has yet employed a series of user-based studies to systematically investigate text legibility in handheld AR applications. In this preliminary work, we survey current approaches to text depictions in AR applications and the literature. We have found no single consistent form of displaying text, but see some basic trends emerging. This initial work lays the foundation for examining different text styles in various environments in order to create guidelines for effective text drawing approaches. By assessing current strategies for rendering text labels in handheld AR, we can catalog drawing styles for use in follow-on user-based studies.},

  abstract={Split learning (SL) is a popular distributed machine learning (ML) method used to enable ML. It divides a neural network based model into subnetworks. Then, it separately trains the subnetworks on distributed parties (e.g., client and server). In distributed ML, data are generated and collected on the client-side. In contrast, the collected data are processed using an application deployed on the server side. However, when applied in practice using Internet of things systems and clients, numerous obstacles occur because of limited configuration and resources. Dividing neural networks in the SL is the biggest problem and an open question in numerous studies. This study introduces splitDyn, which is a new dynamic SL solution to solve the aforementioned problems. This method provides a solution for eliminating their inherent drawbacks. The main idea is to apply a Round-Robin schedule to select the client for the training process. Then, the next idea is to use the Hungarian optimization algorithm to assign a layer to a client and enhance the accuracy. The proposed method reasonably achieved better accuracy and reduced processing time than the other learning models. Furthermore, it applies the incident datasets to predict the incident event and in edge computing for edge artificial intelligence (AI) applications.},

  pages={501-506},
  abstract={Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) robots play an important role in applications that require precise force control, interaction with humans, adaptability, and reliable performance. However, because SEA incorporates a compliant element, such as a spring or an elastic material, precise position control is difficult to obtain. To solve this problem, in this paper, fast terminal sliding mode control is applied to design position control for the SEA robot. In addition, a High Gain Observer (HGO) is also developed to observe the system state variables instead of measuring them. The efficiency of the proposed control algorithm is demonstrated through simulation. A comparison of the fast terminal sliding mode to conventional sliding mode control has been done. The results show that the fast terminal sliding mode control shows a better performance in terms of control input and position accuracy with the SEA robot system.},

  year={2010},

  pages={257-261},
  abstract={Predicting protein mutant stability changes is important for protein design. Although many methods have tried to improve prediction accuracy by various models, it will be difficult to employ them when the required input information is incomplete. Therefore, we have proposed a fuzzy query method previously to predict stability changes upon single mutations using partial input information. However, when a researcher has tens or hundreds of queries to predict, he needs to input query data repeatedly. It is better to issue queries in a batch, which incurs another problem. Because our proposed fuzzy query method is implemented in the FuzzyCLIPS language, it takes a long time to process a batch of queries. To shorten the response time, we propose parallelizing queries in emerging cluster systems or grid systems. Furthermore, to address the problem of heterogeneous computing power of cluster and grid nodes, a variety of self-scheduling schemes have been implemented for better load balance. Experimental results show that our proposed parallel fuzzy query system can provide hundreds of predications in more reasonable response time.},

  abstract={The influence of actively controlled reactive power on the thermal behavior of a multimegawatt wind power converter with a doubly fed induction generator is investigated. First, the allowable range of internal reactive power circulation is mapped depending on the dc-link voltage and the induction generator and power device capacity. Then, the effects of reactive power circulation on current characteristic and thermal distribution of the two-level back-to-back power converter are analyzed and compared. Finally, the thermal-oriented reactive power control method is introduced to the system for the conditions of constant wind speed and during wind gust. It is concluded that the thermal performance will be improved by injecting proper reactive power circulation within the wind turbine system, thereby being able to reduce the thermal cycling and enhance the reliability of the power converter.},

  abstract={The Hopfield network is one of the most important types of neural network, with its readiness for hardware implementation and successful applications in associative memory (AM). However, when used for AM, it has three drawbacks: low capacity, slow convergence speed and weakness. The higher order correlation network (HOCN), suggested by Y.C. Lee (1986), is a direct generalization of the principles which play an important role in the construction of the Hopfield network. It enhances the network's ability by degrees if with a correlation order K (K>2). As for practical applications, unfortunately, difficulties arise due to the complexity in its hardware implementation. In this paper, based on some properties of the human memory, the authors have modified the Hopfield network and suggested a new neural network, emphasizing the importance for AM. It seems the new network has some advantages in its abilities and hardware implementation, so that it is better than both Hopfield's and Y.C. Lee's networks.<>},

  pages={404-415},
  abstract={For the single-phase high-power railway traction system, the inevitable second-order resonating power has become a critical issue to the traction system. In this article, a power-decoupling solution is proposed to replace the conventional passive LC resonance filter by utilizing the buck-type bidirectional dc/dc converter (BBDC) of hybrid electric multiple units, which is designed to power the train in nonelectrified routes using the on-board battery. By considering both the current ripples in the battery mode and the power decoupling in the catenary mode, the corresponding parameter design process of the BBDC is presented. Based on the power coupling phenomenon and the spectrum characteristic of the BBDC, a direct resonance control method is proposed to decouple the low-order resonating power. Simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the new proposal. The results demonstrate that the proposal is almost the same as using the conventional passive LC resonance filter for power decoupling in both steady and dynamic operation scenarios.},

By leveraging the decentralized, immutable, and traceable nature of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanisms and collaborative models of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a secure and trustworthy data sharing platform is established for collaborative analysis, business cooperation, and innovative applications of IoV data. The proposed approach utilizes the decentralized nature and data backup capabilities of blockchain to mitigate the single point of failure issues associated with centralized servers. Additionally, the anonymity, immutability, and traceability features of blockchain ensure the privacy, security, and integrity of data sharing. Moreover, the incentive mechanisms and DAO solutions within the blockchain promote data sharing among vehicles while ensuring data quality.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the shear horizontal wave (SH wave) propagation along the periodic grating surface with grooves in a magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) substrate. The theoretical derivation is given for an arbitrary surface profile. Based on the Bloch-Floquet theorem and by using the Taylor-Mclaurin's series as well as the orthogonality condition of the wave modes, the mechanical, electric and magnetic boundary conditions at the profile surface are first transformed into the equivalent boundary conditions at the reference surface, and then further converted into an infinite set of linear homogeneous equations, whose determinant determines the dispersion relation. In the numerical examples, rectangular grooves are considered and the coupled-mode approximation is applied for truncating the infinite series. Numerical examples are presented for a magneto-electro-elastic (80% PZT4 and 20% CoFe2O4) composite. The results show that a band-gap occurs at the resonance frequency. With the increase of the wave-number, both the frequency and the wave velocity are reduced.},

  abstract={The fifth-generation (5G) mobile systems are considered as a promising infrastructure to provide connectivity for massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices leading to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), i.e., smart manufacturing. The smart manufacturing is characterized by capabilities of digitization, smartization, and connectivity for manufacturing operations and machinery where a huge amount of data has to be processed within ultralow latency. Since the machinery is limited in computing performance, the data generated by the machinery should to be offloaded to the network for process and storage. In this circumstance, the multi-tier multi-access edge computing (mMEC), one of the most important 5G technologies, demonstrate its advantages for data handling within the aforementioned smart-manufacturing requirements. In this paper, we present the mMEC architecture and investigate its role in the Industry 4.0. Moreover, the challenges of utilizing the mMEC in the smart factory are discussed in order to identify future research trends.},

In this work we present detailed simulations of modified 802.11b protocols that purport to provide differential service to wireless VoIP users. The modified protocol we identify as providing the best differential service whilst maintaining the least starvation to best effort users - involves a modified minimum contention window, combined with a modified back-off time. A detailed differential VoIP capacity analysis of this modified protocol is presented. Also, we introduce the notion of a "priority service QoS map" for wireless VoIP. Such a map is a two dimensional representation of the VoIP QoS metrics available to a mobile priority VoIP user, as a function of location. We outline how our VoIP capacity analysis is used to construct a priority service QoS map, and discuss the practical benefits of relaying such maps to mobile users of wireless VoIP},

  abstract={Concept lattice has many applications and isomorphic judgment of concept lattice is important in some fields. This paper presents a novel algorithm of complete lattice isomorphic judgment. The algorithm, first, introduces a layer computing method which divides the nodes into four types according to their indegree and outdegree. Then the equivalence classes are created. Second, taking equivalence classes as least unit, our algorithm creates a mapping between the nodes of two equivalence classes and executes the process of isomorphic judgment using heuristic information of nodes which are extracted from complete lattice. Our algorithm has lower time complexity. And experiment result shows that our algorithm is efficient.},

  abstract={ABBA codes are an important class of quasi- orthogonal space-time block codes proposed by Tirkkonen et al.. Recently, they have become more attractive for practical applications because Yuen et al. have shown that ABBA codes allow pair-wise real-symbol decoding (or equivalently, single-complex symbol decoding) complexity; it is the minimum decoding complexity (MDC) achievable by any non-OSTBC. Additionally, MDC-ABBA codes can achieve full diversity while their code rate is higher than that of OSTBC. In this paper, we present a new, general, simple, and closed-form method to decode MDC-ABBA codes. We explicitly derive the equivalent channel of MDC-ABBA codes and the maximum mutual information of MDC-ABBA. Furthermore, we prove that MDC-ABBA codes can achieve full diversity with transmit and/or receive antenna selection and full or limited feedback.},

  year={2018},
  volume={33},
  number={9},
  pages={8030-8039},
  abstract={Reliability analysis is an important tool for assisting the design phase of a power electronic converter to fulfill its life-cycle specifications. Existing converter-level reliability analysis methods have two major limitations: 1) being based on constant failure rate models; and 2) lack of consideration of long-term operation conditions (i.e., mission profile). Although various studies have been presented on power electronic component-level lifetime prediction based on wear-out failure mechanisms and mission profile, it is still a challenge to apply the same method to the reliability analysis of converters with multiple components. Component lifetime prediction based on associated models provides only a BX lifetime information (i.e., the time when X% items fail), but the time-dependent reliability curve is still not available. In this paper, a converter-level reliability analysis approach is proposed based on time-dependent failure rate models and long-term mission profiles. Two different methods to obtain the component-level time-to-failure are illustrated by a case study of dc/dc converters for a 5 kW fuel cell-based backup power system. The reliability analysis of the converters with and without redundancy is also performed to assist the decision making in the design phase of the fuel cell power conditioning stage.},

The dual-band performance is achieved by the two resonant frequencies of the stepped impedance resonator radiation element. The two bands can be tuned independently. For demonstration purpose, a dual-band antenna operating at 0.9 and 2.5 GHz is analyzed, fabricated and measured. The overall dimension of this antenna is 20mm×80mm. Measurements are in good agreement with the electromagnetic (EM) simulations. Furthermore, in bending tests, the proposed antenna exhibits a low sensibility to performance degradation due to bending. This antenna would be a good candidate for multiband communication applications.},

  abstract={This paper shows a successful application of Geographic information system to maritime safety. Pirate is a main threat to maritime safety. It is a critical problem to calculate the probability of encountering pirates for a trip. This paper proposes a GIS based method to estimate the probability using historical data from International Maritime Bureau (IMB) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). At first, it is assumed that the probability is equal everywhere in the sea. The average probability of piracy is calculated. Then, an adjusting coefficient is proposed to revise the probability of piracy in each trip. The adjusting coefficient of each trip is related to the average number of piracy in every grid which is calculated in Geographic Information System (GIS) and come across by the trip. Finally, a case study of a trip from Shanghai to the Republic of Kenya is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The results show the average probability of encountering pirates in 2012 is 0.0216% when a ship travels a thousand miles. The adjusted probability of encountering pirates for the case is estimated to be 1.62%.},

We applied the working principle of EHDA but employed a sharp pin as reference electrode. As the device works, solution is atomised into plume of particles with sizes under 1 µm and the pin generates ion wind which results in not only reduction of net charge but also propulsion in the particle cloud. The device was able to fabricate particles and fibres from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), at concentrations 5 wt% and 20 wt%. A 5-day growth of breast cancer cells was assayed to investigate the effectiveness for medical applications.},

  abstract={Due to salient advantages, Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) has more application in power network compared to Fixed Speed Wind Turbine. Because of employing back-to-back converters, one of the important studies regarding new grid code requirements is Fault Ride-Through (FRT) capability of the DFIG. To improve the FRT capability, one of the approaches is Fault Current Limiters (FCLs). In this paper, a new approach of application of the FCLs is studied and its location and impedance type will be discussed. Then, the resistive type of the FCL located in the stator side will be proposed. The proposed FCL can insert a controllable resistance in fault current pass to not only restrict fault current level and compensate voltage sag in the stator but also consume pre-fault output active power of the DFIG regarding wind speed variation. Simulation results and analytics are presented to prove the effectiveness of the operation of proposed approach.},

Forty participants completed three experiments relevant to virtual assembly: weight discrimination, part positioning, and manual assembly. Each experiment featured a series of trials generated from factorial combinations of performance variables. Subjects were assessed based on task completion time and different measures of accuracy. When compared to visual-only methods, quantitative results show that haptics-based interaction is beneficial in improving performance by reducing completion times for weight discrimination, permits higher placement accuracy when positioning virtual objects, and enables steadier hand motions along three-dimensional trajectories. The results also indicate that user accuracy in weight discrimination is dependent on hand dominance when manipulating the virtual object combined with the provided sensory information.},

  abstract={The Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) has long been defined as one of the most prominent data models, binary file formats and I/O libraries for storing and managing scientific data. Introduced in the late 90s when POSIX I/O was the standard, the library has since then been continuously improved to respond and adapt to the ever-growing demands of high-performance computing (HPC) software and hardware. Given the limitations of POSIX I/O and with the emergence of new technologies such as object stores, non-volatile memory, and SSDs, the need for an interface that can efficiently store and access data at scale through new paradigms has become more and more pressing. The Distributed Asynchronous Object Storage (DAOS) file system is an emerging file system that aims at responding to those demands by taking disk-based storage out of the loop. We present in this article the research efforts that have been taking place to prepare the HDF5 library for Exascale using DAOS. By enabling and defining a new storage file format, we focus on the benefits that it delivers to the applications in terms of features and performance.},

  abstract={In recent years, the 2.5D IC (Integrated Circuit) package with TSV (Through Silicon Vias) has become important for high-bandwidth and high-performance applications. It is well known that 2.5D technology requires significant innovation in the areas of process technology, packaging, design, thermals, and test solutions leading to several hundred new technologies in a single product. With these complex material sets and process steps combined with new design requirements, methods, and components, a significant amount of research and engineering development is required to bring a successful product to market. After an 8 year development, in July of 2015 AMD reported it began shipment of a new generation of AMD Radeon Fury graphics cards, based on the development of the "Fiji" GPU and the first generation of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM1). This announcement is the next major step in an era for 2.5D IC package technology which will be used in a wide variety of applications. Given the scope of this undertaking many collaborations were required. This paper provides an overview of the collaboration between AMD and ASE. It chronicles the work from initial proof of concept to technology feasibility to product development to production ramp and ultimately high volume production. Details of several functional prototypes are outlined including warpage characterization, stress reduction, materials selection methodologies, and the use of finite element analysis (FEA) and advanced Warpage Metrology Analyzer (WMA) for optimization. The result is a reliable 2.5D process flow with >99% assembly yield for a 1011mm2 interposer with 5 dies attached in a 300+W 55x55mm2 package.},

  abstract={This letter presents a novel three-state contactless radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems switch for wireless applications. The switch is free from stiction and charge injection issues occurred inherently in contact-type RF MEMS switches, thereby increasing reliability and lifetime. The contactless switch is based on variable capacitance between signal lines and movable grounded electrodes controlled by electrostatic actuator. The movable grounded electrode has the capability to move bidirectionally, and therefore, the switch can change among ON-, OFF-, and deep OFF-states. Thus, additional isolation can be achieved in the deep OFF-state. The RF measurement results show that the contactless switch has a capacitance tuning ratio of 5.25 between OFF- and ON-states, and a higher tuning ratio of 11.18 between deep OFF- and ON-states. In addition, the switch exhibits -3.62 dB insertion loss and -24.43 dB isolation at 2.4 GHz. At 5 GHz, the insertion loss and isolation are -2.95 dB and -20.65 dB, respectively.},

The simulated results show that the antenna can cover all GPS bands (L1\L2\L3\L4\L5), which has good impedance matching characteristics in the (1.07–1.60) GHz band. The hybrid ring is designed on popular substrate FR4 with a dielectric constant of 4.4. The simulated results are shown and discussed.},

  abstract={A ball mill pulverizing system is a typical strongly coupled multi-input multi-output (MIMO) plant, which is also nonlinear and widely used in coal-fired power plants. A conventional PID control strategy is not effective for its regulation, so it becomes a difficult problem in thermo-power automation. In view of the key problems in the automatic control of a ball mill system, the authors exploited an optimal expert fuzzy control system based on a net configuration-the Net-Fuzzy control system. The control system has the ability to solve the following technical problems satisfactorily. (1) It solves the measurement of coal load in the ball mill tube using a noise sensor as well as neural networks based soft-sensing, in which, a signal processing technique, multi-function approximation, a multi-media technique, and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) are used. This provides the basic guarantee for control strategy studies. (2) A steady state optimization strategy is presented based on a simple optimization method in order to boost the system's efficiency. (3) Net configuration software is developed for the system controlling database maintenance; system control and configuration are managed separately, so the more flexibility obtained, the easier it is to be mastered by control and operation engineers. Practicability and advanced quality have been verified by its application to many ball mill-pulverizing systems in several power plants.},

  abstract={With the advent of the 5G era, the advanced package structural System-in-Package (SiP) is widely applied in consumer electronics. It can combine more and more heterogeneous components such as RF front-end module, WiFi module for coming 5G application. Compared with typical single side SiP module, the advanced dual side SiP which used double side Surface Mount Technology (SMT) and molding structure to reduce module size and increase components effectively. In this work, a 7 × 7 mm2 dual side molding (DSM) module package with thermal solution structure was chosen to analyze reliability performance. Finite element method (FEM) was firstly constructed and experimentally benchmarked for board level reliability tests including drop and thermal cyclic tests. The results indicate that DSM SiP structure with thermal solution improves junction temperature and thermal resistance. Besides, board level mechanical reliability was eventually enhanced by new DSM thermal solution structure. It can be a new type DSM SiP package for the future 5G application.},

  abstract={With the emergence of many vehicular networking applications, the amount of data traffic in vehicular networks (VNs) is increasing at an exponential rate. Vehicular edge caching (VEC), which utilizes the on board storage resources and road-side edge servers has been considered as a promising technology to satisfy the demands of vehicular networking applications in VNs. However, the classical optimization schemes for content caching perform poorly in VEC primarily owing to the characteristics of the VNs. For instance, the high mobility of vehicles makes the content popularity highly time-varying and location-dependent. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is considered as a powerful technique to improve the caching efficiency in VEC. In this paper, we discuss the distinct challenges in VEC and provide a review on AI-enabled content caching schemes in VEC networks. In addition, we highlight the existing challenges and open research issues in order to spur further investigation in this area.},

  abstract={The paper mainly introduces the application of improved Canny algorithm in the cable insulation layer measurement. This method bases on the traditional Canny edge detective algorithm. In order to obtain ideal parameters, firstly, an adaptive Gaussian filter is used for image pre-processing. And then, the improved amplitude and direction of the gradient are applied in this paper. And to refine the roof of gradient amplitude, non-maxima oppression is used to remove noise. Finally, the product of dual-threshold is greater than single threshold, which leads to better edge detection performance. The adaptive Canny algorithm used in this paper maintains traditional Canny operator's original advantages such as high signal-noise ratio, accurate location, low single-edge response, furthermore, this method increases the ability to suppress false edge; moreover, the degree of automation has been improved, and the method has achieved good results in experiment. On the basis of this method, the traditional edge detection algorithm and other algorithms have been tested, and the experimental results show that the improved method is a feasible and effective way for edge detection in measuring cable insulation parameters system.},

The addition of the mushroom structures generates an extra resonance, which is utilized to broaden the antenna bandwidth. Also, the mushroom structures suppress undesired surface-wave propagating on the substrate, and consequently, enhance the radiation performances. The final design achieves a |S11| <; -10 dB bandwidth of 18% (25.9 - 31.0 GHz) and a broadside gain of 11 dB.
