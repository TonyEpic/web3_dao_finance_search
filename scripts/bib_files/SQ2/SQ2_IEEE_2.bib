  abstract={The TRIDEC system-of-systems establishes collaborative, large-scale concurrent and intelligent information management of natural crises focusing on the integration of task-oriented and proprietary systems, cooperatively interacting as a collective in an environment of heterogeneous and geographically distributed systems. Following the principles of event-driven and service-oriented architectures, the system is able to provide novel yet coherent behaviour and features based on a dynamic self-organization. The process of self-organization is established on the basis of autonomous and concurrent tasks that are enacted by choreographies specifying the expected behaviour of the participating components. Although the individual systems are able to act completely independently, their interactions expose emergent structures of evolving nature in a process of re-organizing their network. By the specification of global conversations, maintained in commonly available semantic registries it is possible to establish a federation of systems that is able to adapt its behaviour to unforeseen events like partly system failures.},

  abstract={Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies have shown great potential in enabling a wealth of decentralized applications (DApps), including but not limited to trustworthy auction, election, autonomous organization. While public blockchains are well recognized to allow participants mutually unbeknownst to achieve consensus, financial/business organizations also find great interest in consortium blockchains for better organizational collaborations. We will touch both types of blockchain and corresponding applications in this tutorial. In particular, we will summarize existing blockchain technologies and applications, elaborate the principles of designing and implementing secure DApps, and analyze the security concerns therein. Through concrete examples, we will discuss common practices and pitfalls, such as on-chain/off-chain interaction, randomness generation, and various corner cases. If time permits, we will also go through the implementation of the cloud-based blockchain backbone that powers this tutorial, possibly covering a layered architecture, and discuss deployment choices and security issues along the way. The tutorial will be interspersed with revisiting the security and implementation rules, so that participants are expected to readily apply the tutorial content into real-world practice. The design principles elaborated in this tutorial will be transferable to participants' development of secure and trustworthy blockchain applications and systems in their own workplaces.},

  abstract={The present study introduces an innovative perspective on data management and processing by combining the OASEES framework with a decentralized, multimodal approach. While centralized processing and cloud hosting have dominated the industry due to their scalability, security, and cost-efficiency, they often restrict operations to a resource-constrained environment dependent on single, large entities, resulting in limitations in data governance and control over access privileges. By incorporating a drone swarm architecture, we transition away from this traditional model and focus on the underexplored potential of decentralization. Our proposed design outfits each autonomous drone, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), with a lightweight 5G system, converting it into a mobile service provider for ground-based User Equipment (UE). The interplay of these UEs and their respective UAV s creates a versatile and robust network, capable of handling high data rates and ensuring reliable connectivity in different operating environments. Our experimental results indicate a compelling correlation between the uplink bit rate of the node UE and the maximum downlink or uplink bit rates of the UEs, a critical discovery for optimizing the drone swarm's performance.},

  abstract={Formally, a collection of two or more autonomous mobile robots working together are termed as teams or societies of mobile robots. In multi robot systems simple robots are allowed to coordinate with each other to achieve some well defined goals. In these kinds of systems robots are far less capable as an entity, but the real power lies in cooperation of multiple robots. The simplicity of multi-robots have produced a potentially wide set of applications such as military missions (battlefield surveillance), searching for survivors in disaster hit areas, parallel and simultaneous transportation of vehicles, and delivery of payloads. Although the research on multi-robot systems has attracted considerable attention worldwide in the past decade, the research in this area is still in its infancy. This paper surveys various interaction techniques in multi robot systems which are important with respect to goal attainment and task completion.},

  abstract={The Metaverse is established by twining a practical world in a virtual form, where users could become creators of learning-based user-generated content (UGC). However, the digital assets are not owned by the creators, which deviates from the decentralized Metaverse based on blockchain in Web 3.0. The contribution incentive design for UGC still faces the challenges of ownership verification and privacy protection. To this end, we propose minting the learning model into the non-fungible token (NFT) with federated learning (FL) assistance (referred to as FL-NFT), such that users as stakeholders can control the ownership and share the economic value of UGC. Specifically, the users are encouraged to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to aggregate local models and mint FL-NFT. We formulate an auction interaction of FL-NFT as imperfect information Stackelberg game (IISG) to optimize the bidding strategies to realize individual rationality. Finally, we conduct simulations to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={Eighteen percent of the world’s population do not have access to electricity, impeding economic, social, and human development. The electricity access challenge can be attributed to the significant investment gap needed to finance new power projects, requiring new and innovative financing options. Independent Power Projects, funded, built, owned, and operated by the private sector and constituted via a special purpose vehicle—a legal entity whose sole purpose is implementing a power project—have become one of the fastest-growing sources of investment in the electricity sector. The limitations of traditional finance sources, including high credit, liquidity, margining, third-party, legal, and process risks, means that funds for these projects are expensive and raised only after a long and arduous process. The present article addresses these challenges by describing a novel decentralized autonomous organization, a blockchain-agnostic special purpose vehicle underpinned by a trio of autonomous mechanisms—mobilization, collateralization, and settlement. These mechanisms enable seamless finance mobilization for the special purpose vehicle from a location-independent crowd, revenue collection from the electricity buyer in a risk-mitigated manner, and disbursal of eventual project revenues to investors.},

  pages={305-309},
  abstract={With the growing adoption of Industry 4.0 concepts in production systems, new challenges arise in engineering control software. Highly distributed control with tight real-time constraints and safety regulations results in increasingly complex software. Current research focuses on increasing the abstraction with new architectures and modularization of software. The presented PhD research addresses modeling of the interactions between control software components, and of the emergent behavior of these compositions. Such behavior models can support the initial implementation, and facilitate (semi-)automated testing and monitoring of control software. Finally, visualizing behavior in a model can enhance understandability of existing control software, when software developers need not access abstracted hierarchy levels to deduct their functionality. This work aims at optimizing the benefit of behavior models in developing control software: Modeling the expected behavior directly for new software will allow using them throughout the software life-cycle. For legacy software, the initial development effort of behavior models will be minimized by automatically capturing behavior models from the implementation. The approach is evaluated in case studies and user studies to integrate experiences from the industrial domain into this software engineering research.},

  abstract={This paper describes a new consensus and governance model for the blockchain, with the objective of protecting the blockchain project against higher-level governance issues by design. As governance issues can lead to human problems, they can impact the proper functioning of the blockchain, leading to loss of cryptocurrency value, hard forks, and even failure of the project. We choose several fail-safe mechanisms and processes used and tested in existing Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work implementations in combination with one another in order to create a framework in line with the philosophy of decentralization of the blockchain and safe against the most common technical and governance pitfalls of the field. Additionally, this composite framework offers ideal circumstances for the creation and success of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations by giving their creators more incentive to start new projects, and more involvement with the governance of the underlying blockchain.},

  abstract={Japan, along with many developed countries, is facing severe social problems caused by a declining birth rate. Gradual shrinkage of the working population has brought shortages of workers performing various services such as elderly care. Women are potential workers, but social assistance of working women remains insufficient. Social services such as elderly care and support for working women must be developed to address these problems. The infrastructure for future ubiquitous services must be designed as a service platform to provide those services respecting individual personal circumstances and at socially acceptable cost. Ubiquitous services provide enhanced mobility. Future ubiquitous services will evolve toward enhanced pervasiveness, and will be defined as advanced personalized services. This report presents a new concept, Socio-familiar Personalized Service (S-P Service), for future ubiquitous services based on sociality and humanity. Moreover, we propose a scalable distributed authentication method to realize S-P Service.},

  abstract={Automating industrial tasks have become critical for organizations due to the inefficiencies and risks associated with conventional procedures. The proliferation of connected devices and machines brings forth a range of security concerns, including data tampering and unauthorized access. Establishing confidential and trustworthy communication between these devices becomes particularly difficult as they rely on the open channel of the Internet. Numerous established security measures, such as antivirus software, access control systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), have been identified in the literature as facing issues like centralized vulnerabilities, latency challenges, reliability issues, and single points of failure. As technology advances rapidly, the convergence of emerging technologies holds immense potential to revolutionize industrial automation. Among these promising technologies, blockchain and 6G stand out for their immense potential. With its decentralized and tamper-proof nature, blockchain has disrupted various sectors, while 6G offers unprecedented connectivity and lightning-fast data transfer speeds. Motivated by these developments, this paper explores the potential impact of integrating blockchain technology with 6G in industrial automation, paving the way for the future of smart factories and intelligent supply chains. Our proposed work aims to provide a holistic understanding of this emerging amalgamation’s key benefits, challenges, offered solutions, and prospects.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are currently being used in various domains and are the current big revolution. The use of autonomous UAVs is even promising for providing new opportunities. Various applications such as surveying, monitoring, search & rescue operations, and delivery would be beneficial if it is done autonomously without human interference. The performance can also be enhanced if a swarm of autonomous UAVs is used. For each and every UAV to contribute effectively and to reduce the task level complexity of individual UAVs the concept of self-organization could be incorporated into the swarm. Self-organization is an individual UAV performing a simple task without any knowledge of the overall goal but indirectly helping to achieve the overall goal. In this paper, a generalized algorithm to scan or survey a particular field for a swarm of UAVs is proposed. The UAVs will perform their tasks in a self-organized manner autonomously. The proposed algorithm is implemented in python and simulated using webots. The algorithm is tested for various scenarios and it is proven to effectively survey the given field.},

  abstract={The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.},

  year={2018},
  volume={6},
  number={},
  pages={12240-12251},
  abstract={The role-based access control (RBAC) framework is a mechanism that describes the access control principle. As a common interaction, an organization provides a service to a user who owns a certain role that was issued by a different organization. Such trans-organizational RBAC is common in face-toface communication but not in a computer network, because it is difficult to establish both the security that prohibits the malicious impersonation of roles and the flexibility that allows small organizations to participate and users to fully control their own roles. In this paper, we present an RBAC using smart contract (RBAC-SC), a platform that makes use of Ethereum's smart contract technology to realize a trans organizational utilization of roles. Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that is designed to be secure, adaptable, and flexible. It pioneered smart contracts, which are decentralized applications that serve as “autonomous agents”running exactly as programmed and are deployed on a blockchain. The RBAC-SC uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the RBAC and to realize a challenge-response authentication protocol that verifies a user's ownership of roles. We describe the RBAC-SC framework, which is composed of two main parts, namely, the smart contract and the challenge-response protocol, and present a performance analysis. A prototype of the smart contract is created and deployed on Ethereum's Testnet blockchain, and the source code is publicly available.},

  abstract={The construction of self-organizing Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is still short of systematic validation methods. These are crucial for acceptance of self-organization in mainstream software engineering. Validation of such systems requires the use of formal descriptions of the underlying coordinating process during the engineering process. The here proposed approach is based on stochastic validation methods applied to the microscopic states under an periodicity assumption. Thus, we propose in this paper Mesoscopic Stochastic Models as a novel methodological artefact for validating self-organizing multi-agent systems. To demonstrate the power of this method we apply it to a self-healing resource-flow system, in which a decentralized coordination process is used to restore the system's functionality after a failure. Information about the error is propagated through an overlay until the system is able to restore its original functionality.},

  abstract={Swarm intelligence is the discipline deals with artificial and natural systems that consists various individuals coordinated using self-organization and decentralized control. It consists of simple autonomous agents that come as emergent collective intelligence. The commands from global plan or leader are not followed by autonomous agent. This type of systems has been seen in various domains that makes swarm intelligence as a multidisciplinary character. Due to its popularity, various researchers have started working on it even in computing tasks but still they are unable to give a good survey on various swarm intelligence algorithms and use of it in computing work. Most of the people are unaware about the newly most effective invented swarm intelligence algorithms. In this paper we have given a comprehensive review on various swarm intelligence algorithms that prove to be efficient in multiple fields. The main focus is given to Bat algorithm, Firefly algorithm, Lion optimization algorithm, Chicken swarm optimization algorithm, Social Spider Algorithm and Spider Moneky optimization algorithm. Another thing covered in this paper is the comparative research on use of Swarm intelligence algorithm in Computing work.

  abstract={With the explosive growth of blockchain platforms and applications, security threats of blockchain also occur frequently. As a decentralized application deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts help the blockchain realize safe and efficient information storage, asset management, and value transfer. Therefore, smart contracts play a vital role in the security of the blockchain. In recent years, security threats against smart contracts have increased, not only causing huge economic losses but also impacting the credit system of the blockchain. Therefore, many researchers have carried out corresponding research on the security threats of smart contracts. Common threat detection methods include formal verification, symbolic execution, fuzzing, etc. Most of these methods are only for known threats, while there is not much work on detecting unknown threats. In order to better deal with unknown threats, we present a review of the typical smart contract security events in recent years, analyze the security threats from contract coding, Ethereum virtual machine, and blockchain characteristics. Further, we compare and summarize the latest unknown threat detection methods. Then, to address the problem that very few unknown threat samples are available, a detection method based on a few-shot learning is proposed.},

  pages={228-232},
  abstract={Although economical and technological progress has made societies more prosperous, it has also created drawbacks such as poverty and unemployment, and not every member of these societies is happy. The dissatisfaction has led to questions and the re-examination of the top-down approach of central government for planning and management. Recently a new type of society has been postulated, in which the happiness of the individual has importance as well as the prosperity of the group. This new trend will come about through a structural change in society itself. Such a restructuring will be accelerated by information technologies, including the Internet/Intranet, which have been rapidly advancing. Global communication networks enable global communication among individuals and eliminate traditional borderlines around organizations and countries; that is, information sent by each individual flows all over the world and an individual can choose the information he/she needs. The name for the above new trend in the structural change of society is "Autonomous Decentralization" and the author believes that the Autonomous Decentralized System (ADS) (K. Mori et al., 1986) will become quite a common technology in every section or every level of society, such as companies, industries, and public organizations. The paper describes the effectiveness of applying ADS technologies to the structure of our new society and indicates the future trend of ADS technologies.},

  pages={51-60},
  abstract={A decentralized application involves multiple autonomous principals, e.g., humans and organizations. Autonomy motivates (i) specifying a decentralized application via a protocol that captures the interactions between the principals, and (ii) a programming model that enables each principal to independently (from other principals) construct its own protocol-compliant agent. An agent encodes its principal's decision making and represents it in the application. We contribute Deserv, the first protocol-based programming model for decentralized applications that is suited to the cloud. Specifically, Deserv demonstrates how to leverage function-as-a-service (FaaS), a popular serverless programming model, to implement agents. A notable feature of Deserv is the use declarative protocols to specify interactions. Declarative protocols support implementing stateful agents in a manner that naturally exploits the concurrency and autoscaling benefits offered by serverless computing.},

  pages={23687-23699},
  abstract={A smart contract is known to be useful for automating business processes triggered by specific events caused by IoT sensors, data feeds, or other applications. A blockchain-based smart contract management system is an innovative technology that is foreseen to automate future business-to-business (B2B) processes. Blockchain is well-known to play a central role in business process re-engineering by optimizing business workflow operations, especially in multi-party arrangements. This paper presents a multi-organizational smart contract management system in which a user can create, deploy, and execute smart contracts. This paper consists of two parts; in the first part, we have compared existing smart contract management systems based on different characteristics that can play a vital role in selecting a particular system for a specific business need. In the second part, while utilizing and building upon the state-of-the-art techniques, we have built a framework for a blockchain-based smart contract and transaction management system. It is a unified architecture supporting DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and organizational level blockchain-based smart contract execution. There are two types of separate blockchains utilized in the proposed framework, i.e., SBlockchain and TBlockchain. SBlockchain is used to store smart contracts, whereas all the data generated by the smart contracts is stored inside the TBlockchain. In addition, each smart contract has some terms and clauses necessary for some event execution. Various components of the framework and their implementation have been described in detail with the help of relevant use-cases.},

  abstract={Rapid development of AI technologies has propelled the seamless integration of physical and cyber worlds with various kinds of online/offline information collected from millions of multimodal sensing systems. The complexity, diversity and uncertainty inherited in such systems, such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), have gone far beyond human capacity of managing and controlling. Our team is among the first to propose the idea of utilizing the nearly unlimited computational resources in cyberspace to construct a bottom-up and top-down combined artificial ITSs for testing, experimenting, representation, verification, and validation of physical ITSs. Especially, the parallel transportation has been developed for safer, smarter, greener, and more reliable transportation services. After three decades of research and field studies, the DeCAST in Transverse, i.e., Decentralized/Distributed Autonomous Operations/Organizations (DAO) in transportation systems, has been envisioned. In this paper, we introduce its architecture, operational processes, software and hardware platforms, and real world applications. Specifically, a transportation foundation model driven by artificial transportation systems, parallel learning and federated intelligence, named TengYun, is outlined for DeCAST.},

  abstract={Currently, the development of the foundation model, metaverse, nonfungible token (NFT), and other emerging technologies has brought profound effects on the whole art field, including art creation, dissemination, transaction, etc. However, there is no research focusing on the framework, methodologies, and applications of the human–machine collaborative creation in the metaverse era. Based on parallel theory, this article proposes a novel human–machine collaborative creation paradigm called ArtVerse, in which machines take on the roles of humans to perform creation exploration and evolution and build decentralized art organizations. Besides, the operational processes involving several key technologies are designed to achieve the proposed ArtVerse. Then, a prototype system of ArtVerse, our long-term efforts toward the human–machine collaborative painting, is presented. Finally, a new ecology of artistic creation in the metaverse era is demonstrated through the applications of the ArtVerse.},

This framework is grounded on the UC Berkeley experience in the design, implementation and demonstration of control and communication systems for networked vehicles for land, sea and air applications. In this process we have developed a perspective on bringing together technological developments, theoretical underpinnings, and computational tools for the design and implementation of networked semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. The motion co-ordination of independent modules that form the Mobile Offshore Base is used as a case study to pinpoint some general characteristics of vehicle formations. A classification of vehicle motion control problems is presented with emphasis on the properties of networked vehicle systems that are useful in our framework. The framework is then developed in terms of agent formations, and organisation of agent formation control encompassing trajectory generation for agent formations, stability and control of individual agents, and supervisory control.},

  abstract={Our objective is to build a distributed terminal system to provide smart, context-aware, rich-experienced applications upon personal environment networking technologies, such as WLAN, IEEE 802.15.3 series, ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc. For the proliferation of smart devices with autonomous applications, the users can get much more service experiences than before. While smart devices facilitate human operation, the coordination of devices through networks may provide applications proactively by gathering much more service context, which indicates the emergence of the pervasive computing age. Hence, we proposed the distributed terminal system for the cooperating of smart devices. In this paper, we analyzed the organization architecture of universal service terminal (UST), the distributed terminal system proposed by us before. In UST project, we have abstracted and encapsulated the capabilities of devices as servers for remote invocation by applications, moreover, the framework functionalities have been introduced for the organization of the distributed system. Though the architecture of UST has been validated feasible in a demonstration, the centralized control mechanisms in the heterogeneous environment are inefficient and unreliable. Thus, we propose an evolved scheme by introducing decentralized mechanisms in this paper. The devices around the user are organized in an overlay peer-to-peer network, and some powerful nodes of them provide the decentralized mechanisms for resource management, service discovery, etc},

  title={PureLottery: Fair Leader Election without Decentralized Random Number Generation}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={273-280},
  abstract={Given n participants, leader election (LE) is the process of designating one of them as the leader or coordinator. LE is ubiquitous in distributed computing and blockchain and has a wide variety of applications ranging from lotteries to proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a blockchain setting, we normally require our LE protocol to be decentralized, lead to a consensus about the elected leader, and be fair, i.e. elect each participant with the same probability $1 /n.$ Traditional blockchain LE solutions reduce the problem to decentralized uniform sampling from the set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}.$ This reduction leads to approaches which are either vulnerable to manipulation, or fail to guarantee fairness, or require inefficient procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), thus making them gas-inefficient and costly when implemented as smart contracts.In this work, we observe that fair leader election can be achieved without explicit decentralized random number generation (RNG). In other words, the intuition behind our work is that RNG is a strictly harder problem than LE. This is because every LE participant is assumed to prefer to be chosen as the leader, e.g. the participant prefers to win the lottery or be the miner for the next PoS block. Thus, they will refrain from actions that would reduce their chance of being selected. This game-theoretic incentive can be exploited to design much simpler protocols for LE in comparison to RNG, by ensuring that dishonest behavior can only reduce the winning chances of the participant.Specifically, we propose PureLottery, a protocol inspired by single-elimination knockout tournaments in sports such as football. We show that PureLottery selects the winner uniformly at random and provides strong game-theoretic guarantees to incentivize honest behavior. PureLottery is also strongly bias-resistant in the sense that every honest participant is guaranteed to win the lottery with probability at least $1 /n$, even if an adversary controls all of the other $n -1$ players. In other words, dishonest behavior will never increase an adversary’s chances of being elected, even if the adversary controls all but one of the participants. Finally, PureLottery is a simple protocol that can be efficiently implemented as a smart contract and uses a small amount of gas in practice. We provide an open-source implementation of the protocol, dedicated to the public domain with no copyright.},

  volume={},

  pages={000275-000281},
  abstract={The growing parallelism and heterogeneity of modern computing infrastructures such as High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms raises new challenges to their programmers and users. Additional requirements have emerged nowadays, such as minimizing the consumed energy, reducing the utilized system resources, or providing built-in reliability mechanisms. Therefore High Performance Computing (HPC) applications require adaptation mechanisms and then must avoid traditional monolithic centralized approaches in favor of novel autonomous, flexible and decentralized decision systems. In this context, we describe here a dynamic and flexible adaptation scheme based on a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to handle parallel or distributed executions in an HPC environment. More precisely, we model and extend the existing HPC middleware Kaapi to offer the power of the ParaMoise multi-agent organizational framework. Our proposed solution, named ParaMASK, relies on the similarities between ParaMoise workflow-based functional specifications and the Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of the distributed execution within Kaapi. As a result, ParaMASK permits to analyze and reorganize the scheduling of tasks that compose a program in an autonomous and decentralized way, while additionally handling dynamic adaptations (using task migration to fulfill energy consumption goals for example). The proposed solution was implemented on top of the existing Kaapi middleware and includes an optimized algorithm for the agent coordination. ParaMASK has been validated with a series of experiments on a real computational grid. Experimental results show a good scalability and an exceptional low overhead induced by the approach: less than 1.5% execution time increase with periodic coordinations every 15 seconds on 2662 cores.},

Historically, these institutions have been relatively autonomous in their day-to-day operations and consequently efforts at computerization have been difficult to adequately coordinate. A recent undertaking of the VA has been to establish decentralized coordination of planning and implementation for hospital computer systems. This presents a unique opportunity to promote standard, portable and well-designed solutions to meet the widely variable needs of a large and diverse health care delivery organization. Although computer systems for each hospital will vary with the needs of the hospital, functional program packages can be delivered and maintained in a cost-effective and manpower-efficient manner. Additionally, because all systems will be based on a common data dictionary it will be possible to gracefully expand systems as needed and to study clinical care and delivery methodologies across many institutions.},

Formation control requires multiple UAVs to adapt to the mission including generate a formation, stay in formation, and change formation. In this paper, we further constrain the formation controller model, not only estimate the desired separation with acceptable accuracy but also ensure a consensus among estimates.

  abstract={Many applications of collective adaptive systems for the digital transformation or digital society will necessarily be multi-functional; that is, the collective, as it adapts over time, will be required to resolve many and different types of problem. However, a long-standing issue for political theorists has been whether a decentralised problem-solving regime can be both 'democratic' and 'epistemic', i.e.\ is it possible to devise decision-making and action-determination processes that take into account both majority preference and expert judgement. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of engineering long-lived and sustainable collective adaptive systems, in which autonomous agents adapt conventional rules in order to be congruent with changes in their operating environment. Based on a preliminary proof of concept and inspiration from political science, we propose a reference architecture for relevant expertise aggregation. We conclude that this is one possible design solution to the problem of enabling an collective to assume direct responsibility for adaptation or adoption of problem-solving policies at a large scale, over long periods of time, and addressing diverse problem types.},

  abstract={The Web service technology enables dynamic service composition, resource utilisation and application integration in a heterogeneous computing environment. Web services can be used to compose and perform flexible and complex business flows. In practice, a Web service may create multiple service instances working for different business flows or business sessions, whilst the service instances within a business session may be created by different Web services, often designed, implemented and maintained by different organisations across different security domains. This introduces new challenges to existing security systems and solutions. For many applications ensuring security only at the level of Web services is not enough for a fine-grained level of control for multi-party collaborations because interactions amongst Web services in fact happen at the level of service instances. In this paper, we address the problem of how to secure instance-level interactions in Web services, and discuss different schemes for identifying and authenticating service instances. We present an experimental system and analyse some performance results. The experimental system implements instance-level communication control and instance authentication. The experimental results demonstrate that the overhead of execution time introduced by instance authentication is proportional to the number of the session partners within a business session.},

  abstract={This paper is written to provide an insight on how blockchain technology has a very high potential in providing an alternative way to attractively organize modern finance. Blockchain today is not merely bitcoin or other crypto currencies. It impacts various other sectors such as supply chain management, voting mechanisms, original content creation, secure sharing of data, etc. But this paper relates to today's world of fluted, along with blockchain. It rightly points out the flaws associated with the current financial world and how blockchain provides a solution to it. This paper also demonstrates the various applications of blockchain in finance such as De-Fi (Decentralized Finance), Dapps (Decentralized Apps), Smart contracts, cross border payments, NFTs, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations). It also shows how blockchain can bring out a more efficient and secure finance industry. It also contains information on crypto currencies — their various usages, and their underlying fundamental principles.},

  abstract={Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain's role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain's potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain's role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain.},

  abstract={The incorporation of edge computing has become essential in the big data and Internet of Things age to tackle issues related to latency, real-time processing, and data scale. This paper delves into the imperative need for edge computing within the context of big data environments. Distributed deep learning methodologies are explored, encompassing a diverse array of deep learning models. Particularly, a novel paradigm named Data Forwarding based Decentralized Deep Neural Network (DF-DDNN) is introduced to achieve low latency IoT-Edge computation. In order to reduce latency in Io T ecosystems, the DF-DDNN model makes use of edge devices’ processing capabilities. By strategically distributing data processing and computation at the edge, this model seeks to overcome inherent limitations of conventional Io T architectures, with a keen focus on network, processing, and overall latencies. The research provides a thorough performance evaluation that compares the DF-DDNN model’s performance versus conventional IoT models in a number of areas. The outcomes demonstrate how much better the suggested DF-DDNN model is than traditional IoT systems. Notably, improvements are evident in terms of reduced network latency, accelerated processing speeds, and overall latency mitigation. This research underscores the critical importance of embracing edge computing in the context of big data and deep learning applications. The DF-DDNN model emerges as a promising avenue for advancing IoT-Edge computation, effectively addressing latency concerns and augmenting the performance of IoT-enabled systems.},

  abstract={Grid is an ambitious and exciting global effort to develop an environment in which individual users can access computers, databases and experimental facilities simply and transparently, without having to consider where those faculties are located. Monitoring the behavior of the resources of a distributed system, especially grid, is necessary, both for determining the cause of performance problems, and for tuning the system, which results in optimized performance. However writing monitoring and management applications for grid resource is a complex task. This is due to the geographic distribution of resources and heterogeneous environments that are owned by different organizations. We have proposed architecture for autonomous grid node monitoring agent, to address the issues of complex resource monitoring and management. The architecture is based on grid monitoring architecture (GMA) and is autonomous as it provides functionality of equality, locality and self-containment, which are main components of autonomic controllability in any sub system as part of autonomous decentralized system (ADS) (K. Mori, 1993). The evaluation results of the proposed system proved the validity of the concept for achieving autonomous resource management in dynamic systems like grid.},

  abstract={Smart Manufacturing is characterized by the digitization and massive communication of Cyber-Physical Systems under the Industrial Internet of Things paradigm. However, the heterogeneity of communication protocols hinders connectivity among assets due to lack of interoperability. Moreover, the decomposition of the classical production hierarchy towards decentralized self-organization makes the implementation of interoperability in industrial environments key to help decision-making. In this sense, the interoperability of heterogeneous assets (e.g., external, internal, and human) has been defined as hyperconnectivity and supposes a technological challenge in the scientific literature. To prove this novel hyperconnectivity definition, the authors propose and develop a novel hyperconnected demonstrator where all types of assets are interconnected in a case study consisting of the automation of an inspection process. For this purpose, an industrial internet platform has been used for connecting industrial equipment creating a collaborative environment through the use of interoperability. In this regard, it has been possible to communicate assets among the cloud, humans, and CPS with a processing time of less than 10 ms, which demonstrates that the technological challenge of implementing the hyperconnectivity concept of this paper has been successfully addressed.},

  year={2004},

  pages={483-},
  abstract={Summary form only given. We propose a biologically inspired and fully-decentralized approach to the organization of computation that is based on the autonomous scheduling of strongly mobile agents on a peer-to-peer network. Our approach achieves the following design objectives: near-zero knowledge of network topology, zero knowledge of system status, autonomous scheduling, distributed computation, lack of specialized nodes. Every node is equally responsible for scheduling and computation, both of which are performed with practically no information about the system. We believe that this model is ideally suited for large-scale unstructured grids such as desktop grids. This model avoids the extensive system knowledge requirements of traditional grid scheduling approaches. Contrary to the popular master/worker organization of current desktop grids, our approach does not rely on specialized super-servers or on application-specific clients. By encapsulating computation and scheduling behavior into mobile agents, we decouple both application code and scheduling functionality from the underlying infrastructure. The resulting system is one where every node can start a large grid job, and where the computation naturally organizes itself around available resources. Through the careful design of agent behavior, the resulting global organization of the computation can be customized for different classes of applications. In a previous paper, we described a proof-of-concept prototype for an independent task application. We generalize the scheduling framework and demonstrate that our approach is applicable to a computation with a highly synchronous communication pattern, namely Cannon's matrix multiplication.},

The EGP class of protocols with modifications and newer versions continued to be used for the communication among autonomous systems (ASs). It was sheer chance that the first protocol developed for the EGP class of routing was also named the EGP, which became obsolete with time and was replaced with another protocol named the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP was designed for decentralized routing and came as a replacement for EGP to support transition from Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) to National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet). To participate in BGP routing, each AS should have at least one router running BGP. An AS may also have more than one router running BGP, and these routers may even communicate within the AS using BGP.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT), which connects billions of electrical gadgets over the internet, has completely transformed the digital world. In the present day, as traditional equipment become more autonomous and intelligent, IoT devices are crucial. Increased data transfer is one major problem where 5 g networks world is crucial. However, these Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilizecentralized architecture-based protocols, which may result in a number of security risks for the data. Virtual reality, autonomous robotics, self-driving cars, and security difficulties may all be resolved by integrating artificial intelligence with 5G wireless infrastructure. The main goal of the system is to increase user confidence without relying on external authority. Blockchain has become a crucial technology that keeps track of the network’s event records via a distributed ledger. For IoT devices, blockchain offers a safe, decentralized, and trustworthy ecosystem. IoT and blockchain integration, however, is not without its difficulties. For instance, poor throughput is a key problem. IoT devices need a substantially greater throughput than the 12 to 15 transactions per second that the Ethereum blockchain network can currently handle. On light of this, blockchains are unable to function in an IoT-based 5G network. The blockchain’s network is the factor that restricts throughput. The P2P network’s delayed transaction and block propagation prevents miners and verifiers from quickly mining and, respectively, verifying new blocks. Therefore, the main problem with IoT-based blockchains is network scalability. That is in our past work, we utilized a dispersed blockchain organization to defeat the issue of organization versatility, and in this article, we utilize the Pontoon agreement technique to help the throughput of the blockchain. Security is one more essential worry with IoT organizations. Unfortunately, the blockchain’s dispersed records are available to general society and delicate information is open to anyone on the organization; in any case, in these conditions, outsider altering isn't possible without uncovering the first items. We utilized zkLedger, a zero-information based cryptography-based arrangement, to address security challenges.},

  abstract={With the tremendous advances in hand-held computing and communication capabilities, rapid proliferation of mobile computing environments, and decreasing device costs, we are seeing a growth in mobile e-business in various consumer and business markets. The trend is also picking up in large enterprises where dependency on mobile e-business environments has become routine for thousands of employees conducting daily business activities. For such a large collection of users, new reliable methods of search-find-obtain-transact (SPOT) have to be devised that are decentralized and self-managing. We present the grand challenges involved in designing and implementing reliable and transparent e-business applications in a decentralized and autonomous fashion that can handle business-critical applications in enterprises and virtual organizations. We present a novel architecture and framework for end-to-end mobile e-business applications based on concepts from P2P, dynamic socio-economic networks (overlays) and resource allocation from grid computing. The architecture takes into consideration disconnection, application context, synchronization, transactions and self-managing failure recovery modes to provide mobile users with seamless and transparent access to data and resources when needed. In addition, the mechanisms designed consider decentralized resource management for providing data availability and fast access. In our architecture, we consider a business process design based on state-machines and failure event management to handle disconnection, resource limitations and failures in open dynamic networks. We consider simple cost-based P2P networks as the underlying framework for connecting millions of mobile devices to thousands computational servers. A first-version of this system was designed, implemented and deployed a network of mobile clients using open Web-services standards.},

This paper proposes a framework named autonomous vehicular edge (AVE) for edge computing on the road, with the aim of increasing the computational capabilities of vehicles in a decentralized manner. By managing the idle computational resources on vehicles and using them efficiently, the proposed AVE framework can provide computation services in dynamic vehicular environments without requiring particular infrastructures to be deployed. Specifically, this paper introduces a workflow to support the autonomous organization of vehicular edges. Efficient job caching is proposed to better schedule jobs based on the information collected on neighboring vehicles, including GPS information. A scheduling algorithm based on ant colony optimization is designed to solve this job assignment problem. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of this approach over competing schemes in typical urban and highway scenarios.},

  year={2023},
  volume={11},
  number={},
  pages={98516-98531},
  abstract={Numerous abnormal transactions have been exposed as a result of targeted attacks on Ethereum, such as the Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization attack. Exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts, malicious users can pursue their own illicit objectives through abnormal transactions. Consequently, identifying these malevolent users, implicated in fraudulent activities and their attribution, becomes exceedingly complex. Cryptocurrency transactions used for malicious purposes, employing pseudo-anonymous accounts to send and receive ransom payments and accumulating funds under various identities, further highlight the need to control and detect these abnormal transactions for maintaining a high level of security within the Ethereum network. Although existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) help mitigate abnormal transaction occurrences, their performance necessitates improvement. To address this issue, this study presents a novel approach, named Abnormal Transactions Detection Using a Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network (ATD-SGAN), which efficiently detects abnormal attacks within the Ethereum network. ATD-SGAN leverages a semi-supervised generative adversarial network for this purpose. The results demonstrate that ATD-SGAN significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art IDSs. It achieves an increase in detection accuracy from 3.78% to 11.05% and reduces the false alarm rate from 42.29% to 0.15%. Moreover, ATD-SGAN notably improves the F1-measure, ranging from 10.39% to 3.79%, compared to the current IDSs.},

The provision of those functionalities will avoid applications deal with most of complexities derived from groups and its members, what will help inclusion of collaborative aspects. The implementation of LaCOLLA follows the peer-to-peer paradigm and pays special attention to autonomy of its members and to self-organization of the components of the infrastructure. Another key aspect is that resources (e.g. storage) and services (e.g. authorization) are provided by its members (avoiding dependency from agents not belonging to group).},

  abstract={Decentralized coordination can be achieved by the emergence of a consensual choice inside a group of simple agents. The work done on the emergence of social laws and the emergence of a shared lexicon are known examples of possible benefits of consensus formation. In this paper, we show the possibility of creating random succession of social choices inside a group of simple and homogeneous agents with limited perception abilities where there is no central control. The society of agents evolves in a sequence of different consensual choices, from consensus to consensus, in a kind of random collective walk. The transition between different collective choices is conditioned by performance criteria as we do not want that a society oscillates between several possible decisions but that it chooses one of them as quickly as possible. Both the nature of the collective choices and the duration of the consensus are completely random. We introduce a very simple individual behavior that was originally derived from a failure attempt to use an auto-organization model of dominance order formation in the animal world. We show one application of this transition between consensual choices in a group of micro-painters that create random artistic patterns},

It can be a blockchain, Directed Acylic Graph, Hashgraph, Holochain, or Tempo (Radix).Blockchain uses an asymmetric cryptography mechanism to validate the authenticity of transactions. The hash function used here is a mathematical algorithm that converts any information into a string of alphanumeric values by a process called &#x201c;encryption.&#x201d; There are mainly two types of encryption &#x2013; asymmetric encryption and symmetric encryption, depending on whether same or different keys are used for encryption and decryption.Decentralized identifiers (DID) allow unique, private, and secure peer&#x2010;to&#x2010;peer connections between two parties on a blockchain. DIDs are independent of centralized registries, authorities, or identity providers, which enable identity&#x2013;owner control and sovereignty over identities.There have been several innovations around blockchain consensus mechanisms, constitutional design, development of smart contracts, and tokens. Earlier, applications were mainly restricted to digital currencies, which were used in commercial transactions. The extension of Blockchain 2.0 applications enabled smart&#x2010;contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

Designs based on a centralised hierarchy on the one hand and completely edge-computing based autonomous systems on the other are well investigated and documented but offer specific disadvantages concerning adaptiveness, control and scalability. This article presents a hybrid approach by suggesting an application-aware optimised compromise. Existing approaches as well as requirements and resulting challenges are outlined. Based on that, an extended middleware is introduced, that does not only act as an abstract communication platform but also organises the cyber-physical system by providing a centralised high-level controller component that issues recommendations that are created based on a global view on the domain-specific conditions. Its architecture makes this component completely independent of the lower system levels. Hence, it can flexibly be integrated into different topologies and ported to various use cases. Although the presented approach does not restrict any task allocation strategy, it is shown that decentralised task distribution provides advantages and can easily be implemented based on our recommendations. A simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that this abstract control strategy is able to support performant and effective behaviour of the cyber-physical system.},

  abstract={Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) has been used in the most diverse applications, as electric vehicles and having a small size, they could land in small spaces and maybe in dense urban areas. Another type of vehicle used is the Unmanned air vehicle (UAV), which doesn't need user (human) control. The future of the development of this technology is the use of these vehicles to make deliveries and transportation of people and many others, having many vehicles making transit in small areas, leading to traffic jams. Despite this, most research focuses on scenarios with only one or a few agents. These scenarios, however, do not reflect the reality expected in the future, including multiple aircraft controlled by different entities, with diverse goals. These scenarios, mainly urban and used in dense areas, with many vehicles having to share the same air space, the normal Air Traffic Management (ATM) could not handle this new traffic, of hundreds of small and autonomous vehicles, in a central city region, this requires specific rules that have been called UAM (Urban Air Mobility). Bringing issues as safety and rules regarding the organization of this new system. This work aims to present scenarios using computer simulations created based on a multi-agent simulation tool or a Multi-Agent System (MAS). The MAS has the advantage that we could create and simulate more powerfully the existence of multiple vehicles (or agents) that act independently, as would happen in a real situation. This tool uses the Netlogo language and allows the modeling of multiple UAVs with stochastic trajectories created in a decentralized way, verifying how the model deals with conflicts and obstacles, highlighting some challenges and capabilities of UAM. Presenting some scenarios, using different parameters, such as aircraft by distinct capacities and in adverse climatic situations. As well, analyzes of results from these simulations conducted to assess the safety and the performance of the process. Using this tool, we propose some testing scenarios and execute some validation using multiple executions with different parameters as the number of planes and velocity to get results as the trajectory time and the number of conflicts. With this data, we try to show that we could estimate the airspace capacity and validate the safety of the given model used parameters. We will show some results of the execution of this tool and try to make some inferences and draw some conclusions based on these results.},

  abstract={We address a self-organizing network problem for autonomous robotic sensor swarms towards various ad hoc sensor network applications. For this purpose, a decentralized solution approach is proposed to enable individual robots to build and to maintain their network through locally communicative interactions with adjacent robots. Specifically, the communicative interaction allows robots to select specific neighbors with higher connectivity, and to adapt to network topological changes by robot movements. The proposed approach is verified to be effective through extensive simulations for the secure self-organization of a robotic sensor network. Considering the realistic conditions of communication delays and re-configuration for robot disappearances due to robot failures, simulations are also performed.},

At the same time, it is also highly necessary the role of a subscription and notification mechanism that, starting from context, triggers services within the GAmI system. We argue that the glue between GAmI software components should be realized by a middleware that manages connectivity and messaging by implementing event channels and service sharing mechanisms based on advanced decentralized protocols. Moreover, it should provide self-organization and self-adaptation mechanisms in order to support the (spontaneous or induced) dynamic creation of composite services, and support seamless task migration. In this view, we propose the novel middleware called NAM4J, and we illustrate how it can be used to build a GAmI mobile sensing application.},

  abstract={Summary form only: Recently the requirements of the users have been diversifying and changing, therefore the manufactures and providers have to dynamically change and modify the business processes. To cope with this tendency, the processes have become more mutually correlated. As the markets are competitive and globalized, the SCM (Supply Chain Management) and e-commerce systems have been developed, and then the business processes among the organizations are closely correlated. The computing system for this business trend has the features that the system has to change in the business-level process (service), the services are mutually correlated, and the correlation among the services varies according to the changing business. In these years, the change of the business is unpredictable but the system is required to adapt quickly to the new situations. The system simultaneously involves the heterogeneous modes of the partial system expansion, modification, maintenance, failures, and integration with the others. Even in these situations, the system is required to achieve the assurance of keeping the system operation and the service provision. For this environment, the system has to be designed with the standpoints that it almost always changes but the change cannot be predicted. It is rather difficult to specify the totality of the system including its objectives, structure, functions and operation, but only the subsystem (or service) can be clarifies. The system is the result of integration of subsystems. The ADS (Autonomous Decentralized System) concept is proposed in 1977 on the basis of living thing, which almost always changes in its growth and metabolism. As well as each cell of living body with DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the subsystem in the ADS has the autonomy to control itself and coordinate with the others. The ADS system architecture consists of the communication logical field, called DF (Data Field), and the subsystems. The subsystems mutually communicate through the DF. All of the data, with attaching its content-code corresponding to the meaning of the data, is sent out to the DF from the subsystem. Each of the other subsystems autonomously selects to receive the data based on the content-code and asynchronously starts its execution when all of the necessary data is received. A subsystem can autonomously recognize the changing situation through monitoring the DF, and then a subsystem can adapt the changing relationship with the others. The assurance of the system is achieved on this system architecture consisting of the autonomous subsystems and the DF. The applications of the ADS have been expanded to the various fields. The control system has to respond in real-time and then the several services composition performed in parallel. Within the time limit, the most appropriate services can be executed, while over the time limit, the safe guaranteed services are selected. In the information system, the large amount of information is supplied to many users and responded from them. Then the fairness among the users is necessary to satisfy the users' demanding service-levels. In the integrated systems of the control and information, such as the SCM system for manufacturing, logistics, sales and marketing, train system for vehicle regulation and passengers' information services, and smart grid system for measurement of energy consumption and generation/charge of energy, the consistency management among the heterogeneous services is inevitable. The ADS is applicable to the service-oriented system engineering and they can be much more accelerated towards their advancement according to not only the business requirements but also the distributed and web technologies.},

  abstract={Today's business revolution depends on digital transformation. Public and private organization's experts forecast the technology which plays a concrete role in their business processes steadfastly. Cloud computing plays a corporeal role in information technology operations to provide a low cost, dexterity, flexibility and scalability. Measureless IoT clients and its applications are urging to execute their business process intelligently and rapidly. Globalized process has been taken place in cloud computing, however this mobilized process is too slow to accommodate the time susceptible tasks [1]. Thus introducing next big computing technology termed as fog computing. The goal of Foggingis to implement the decentralized computing architecture, which distributes data, storage, compute and applications between the data source and the cloud. It outspreads the conception of cloud to the edge of the network and it is closely associated with IoT devices. To bring power to the cloud services, Fog computing scrutinizes and resolves the problem by keeping the data closerto the origin [9]. EdgeComputing empowers the data outcome by IoT devices. This IoT device's process can be processed nearer to itsorigin. By doing this optimized process, long routes data transmission is eluded. Optimized data can be sent to the common data centers or clouds for further process.In this paper, discussed about an extensive similarities and dissimilarities of Cloud, Fog and Edge computing.},

  abstract={We propose a biologically inspired and fully-decentralized approach to the organization of computation that is based on the autonomous scheduling of strongly mobile agents on a peer-to-peer network. Our approach achieves the following design objectives: near-zero knowledge of network topology, zero knowledge of system status, autonomous scheduling, distributed computation, lack of specialized nodes. Every node is equally responsible for scheduling and computation, both of which are performed with practically no information about the system. We believe that this model is ideally suited for large-scale unstructured grids such as desktop grids. This model avoids the extensive system knowledge requirements of traditional grid scheduling approaches. Contrary to the popular master/worker organization of current desktop grids, our approach does not rely on specialized super-servers or on application-specific clients. By encapsulating computation and scheduling behavior into mobile agents, we decouple both application code and scheduling functionality from the underlying infrastructure. The resulting system is one where every node can start a large grid job, and where the computation naturally organizes itself around available resources. Through the careful design of agent behavior, the resulting global organization of the computation can be customized for different classes of applications. In a previous paper, we described a proof-of-concept prototype for an independent task application. In this paper, we generalize the scheduling framework and demonstrate that our approach is applicable to a computation with a highly synchronous communication pattern, namely Cannon's matrix multiplication.},

  abstract={Block-chain emerged as the technology of choice for most applications because of its immutability property. Block-chain's immutability property promotes network resilience against any removal or modification of data stored on the ledger. However, large scale networks such as the Internet of Things (IoT) that may contain millions of nodes can significantly increase Block-chain size and raise serious privacy challenges. Moreover, the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPRs) that were enforced in May 2018 by European countries allows individuals and organizations to take control of their data by establishing stringent rules which includes “the right to be forgotten”. In cases where there are ethical or legal reasons individuals and companies might want their personal data stored to be erased whether such data is stored locally or on the ledger. The philosophy underpinning Block-chains is that forcing nodes to erase data is akin to denying them a role to play in the Block-chain ecosystems as full nodes. In this paper, we attempt to challenge this notion by proposing a model framework for an enhanced privacy that is akin to Block-chain erasure. Our approaches combine ring signatures (that have long been used to generate anonymous signatures) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) that can help to disguise user's wallet addresses.},

  abstract={Nowadays, urban environments suffer from recurrent traffic jams and their associated side effects. In order to cope with this issue, several solutions were proposed, mostly relying on road-operated traffic management strategies. Recent studies show the potential of connected and automated cars to improve traffic by adapting individual behaviors. For instance, thanks to autonomous decision-making capabilities, platoon systems enable a group of vehicles to travel attached to each other by a virtual link. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) empowered by Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) can be used to control a fleet of cars in a decentralized way. This paper applies this concept for dynamic platoon vehicles system through a multi-agent model based on Newtonian physics to achieve a self-organization at the. The behavior can be improved by offering more computing power or a better knowledge of the environment thanks to a micro-service division. In this proposal, the vehicle is considered to be a physical agent with personal behavior divided into three layers : perception based on sensor, decision based on physics simulation and application helped by embedded robotics.},

  abstract={During the past few years much effort has been put into developing interoperable grid models suitable of defining a decentralized control setting. Such environments may define new rules and actions to internal Virtual Organisation (VO) members and therefore posing new challenges towards to an extended cooperation model of grids. Particularly, VO members' knowledge may be expressed in the form of intelligent agents thus providing a more autonomous solution of communicating members. Herein we present a mobile agent middleware for Grid interoperable infrastructures. Facing the enlarging scale of Grid, the proposed middleware aims to extend the knowledge of a specific neighbouring of Grid members (VO) in relation to the addresses and the physical resources of known and unknown nodes which may join the Grid VO. The internal data are structured in a rational sequence and stored within a public profile of each member called metadata snapshot profile. The middleware is designed by employing the Java Agent Development (JADE) framework in which mobile agents are travelling throughout the domain and by collecting and updating internal data they extend the size of the VO. The interoperable standard is achieved by using the Critical Friends Community (CFC) model, as the mean to fulfil the inter-cooperation model.},

Swarm intelligence, which represents an artificial intelligence technique based on the study of collective behavior in self-organized systems, i.e., collective intelligence of groups of simple agents, is also discussed, including the techniques of Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization. The discussion then encompasses Multi-agent systems, systems that consist of multiple agents or vehicles with several sensors/actuators and the capability to communicate with one another to perform coordinated tasks. The Consensus problem is presented in detail, on the basis of the concepts of Graph theory. Modeling of bird flocking is presented as an example. Decentralized control of autonomous vehicles is taken as another example, with an accent on Formation Control and Sensor Networks. A detailed discussion covers the vehicle and multi-robot formation stability problem, as well as decentralized estimation and control problems in Multi-agent systems based the implementation of a consensus strategy.},

  abstract={The software development life cycle (SDLC) starts with business and functional specifications signed with a client. In addition to this, the specifications also capture policy / procedure / contractual / regulatory / legislation / standard compliances with respect to a given client industry. The SDLC must adhere to service level agreements (SLAs) while being compliant to development activities, processes, tools, frameworks, and reuse of open-source software components. In today's world, global software development happens across geographically distributed (autonomous) teams consuming extraordinary amounts of open source components drawn from a variety of disparate sources. Although this is helping organizations deal with technical and economic challenges, it is also increasing unintended risks, e.g., use of a non-complaint license software might lead to copyright issues and litigations, use of a library with vulnerabilities pose security risks etc. Mitigation of such risks and remedial measures is a challenge due to lack of visibility and transparency of activities across these distributed teams as they mostly operate in silos. We believe a unified model that non-invasively monitors and analyzes the activities of distributed teams will help a long way in building software that adhere to various compliances. In this paper, we propose a decentralized CAG - Compliance Adherence and Governance framework using blockchain technologies. Our framework (i) enables the capturing of required data points based on compliance specifications, (ii) analyzes the events for non-conformant behavior through smart contracts, (iii) provides real-time alerts, and (iv) records and maintains an immutable audit trail of various activities.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology that came with the introduction of Bitcoin offers many powerful use-cases while promising the establishment of distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs) that may transform our current understanding of client-server interactions on the cyberspace. They employ distributed consensus mechanisms that were subject to a lot of research in recent years. While most of such research focused on security and performance of consensus protocols, less attention was given to their incentive mechanisms which relate to a critical feature of blockchains. Unfortunately, while blockchains are advocating decentralized operations, they are not egalitarian due to existing incentive mechanisms. Many current consensus protocols inadvertently incentivize centralization of mining power and inequitable participation. This paper explores and evaluates alternative incentive mechanisms for a more decentralized and equitable participation. We first evaluate inequality in existing Proof of Stake (PoS) based incentive mechanisms, then we examine three alternatives in which rewards scheme is more partial to low-stakeholders. Through simulation, we show that two of our alternative mechanisms can reduce inequality and offer an attractive solution for sustainability of blockchain-based applications and DAOs.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology has become a promising approach in many domains. It first came up with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, where it is used to maintain a distributed ledger, a public list of all transactions. It is assumed that the use of a blockchain as a cryptocurrency, or in general for financial services, was just the first stage, called Phase 1.0. The second phase began with the integration of smart contracts. In Phase 3.0, the focus lies on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which efficiently implement smart contracts. In the future, it is assumed, that by the use of DAOs many benefits for the public sector emerge. In this paper, blockchain applications of Phase 2.0 and 3.0 are analyzed for measuring instruments under legal control. An example are smart meters, where by smart contracts, a new coin/token within the blockchain can be created whenever the electric meter rotates. Promising areas of application in legal metrology, like a decentralized audit trail to log, e.g., software updates and hinder uncertified manipulations, the complete automation of the legally supervised update mechanism by smart contracts, or an alternative to public key infrastructures are being proposed in this paper.},

  abstract={Blockchain in the banking and finance industry makes it easy for remote, untrusted parties to build consensus on the state of a database, without the intervention of gatekeepers. It handles all financial transactions like payment, settlement system, fundraising, securities management, loans, credit and trade finance, etc. like a bookkeeper. This is the reason why it surpasses the traditional system in terms of identity verification, payments, withdrawals, settlements, credits and loans, asset transfers, peer&#x2010;to&#x2010;peer transfers, hedge funds, safety and accountability. This makes the foundation of the present chapter.Another area that is poised for a blockchain revolution is trade finance. Trade finance relies heavily on paper&#x2010;based business operations, involving information transmission, asset transfer, and payment processes. Excessive documentation, high bank charges, and the possibility of forgery cannot be ruled out. Instead of legal terms, these contracts may be better described in Python programming language so that traders can better understand them. Thus, blockchain, along with smart contracts, provides a secure, transparent, auditable, and automated transaction environment for business investors. The current chapter explains how to revolutionize trade finance by rationalization of the processes of smart contracts, enterprise resource planning, lightning network, pre&#x2010; and post&#x2010;trade processes, accounts and audits, and loyalty rewards through blockchain. The challenges posed by blockchain adoption, such as security, scalability, blockchain, privacy, and legal enforcement, have also been contemplated and resolved.Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on blockchain and is altogether different from existing financial networks by being open and programmable. In this chapter, the product and potential of myriad use&#x2010;cases of decentralized finance, such as asset management, tokenization, token derivatives, decentralized autonomous organization, data analysis and assessment, payments, lending and borrowing, insurance, margin trading, market place, gaming, and yield farming have been delineated. It also outlines Ethereum as a platform for DeFi to transfer funds, streaming money, programmable currency, lending, borrowing, no&#x2010;loss lotteries, exchange tokens, advance trading, fund aggregation, portfolio management, quadratic funding, crowd funding, and insurance.Interpreting decentralized markets, a comparative account of the features of some software applications, such as Augur, Totemfi, Finance.vote, OptionRoom, and PolyMarket have been given. Finally, how supply chain management, e&#x2010;commerce, and distributed resources can be strengthened through blockchain has been highlighted.},

  abstract={Parallel transportation management and control was proposed three decades ago as a new paradigm for conducting complex transportation operations and has led to today’s DeCAST in TransVerse platform designed and constructed according to the principle of decentralized/distributed autonomous operations and organizations. This article presents an overview of its architectures, processes, operating procedures, and major applications. The developments and applications have demonstrated clearly that parallel transportation systems are effective for networked traffic control and distributed logistical operations. The existing challenges and emerging opportunities are also addressed. A transportation foundation model based on parallel learning and federated intelligence is proposed as a potential path to the next-generation parallel intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract={The cryptocurrency Ethereum is the most widely used execution platform for smart contracts. Smart contracts are distributed applications, which govern financial assets and, hence, can implement advanced financial instruments, such as decentralized exchanges or autonomous organizations (DAOs). Their financial nature makes smart contracts an attractive attack target, as demonstrated by numerous exploits on popular contracts resulting in financial damage of millions of dollars. This omnipresent attack hazard motivates the need for sound static analysis tools, which assist smart contract developers in eliminating contract vulnerabilities a priori to deployment. Vulnerability assessment that is sound and insightful for EVM contracts is a formidable challenge because contracts execute low-level bytecode in a largely unknown and potentially hostile execution environment. So far, there exists no provably sound automated analyzer that allows for the verification of security properties based on program dependencies, even though prevalent attack classes fall into this category. In this work, we present HoRStify, the first automated analyzer for dependency properties of Ethereum smart contracts based on sound static analysis. HoRStify grounds its soundness proof on a formal proof framework for static program slicing that we instantiate to the semantics of EVM bytecode. We demonstrate that HoRStify is flexible enough to soundly verify the absence of famous attack classes such as timestamp dependency and, at the same time, performant enough to analyze real-world smart contracts.},

  number={3},
  pages={373-384},
  abstract={Desktop grids have been used to perform some of the largest computations in the world and have the potential to grow by several more orders of magnitude. However, current approaches to utilizing desktop resources require either centralized servers or extensive knowledge of the underlying system, limiting their scalability. We propose a new design for desktop grids that relies on a self-organizing, fully decentralized approach to the organization of the computation. Our approach, called the organic grid, is a radical departure from current approaches and is modeled after the way complex biological systems organize themselves. Similar to current desktop grids, a large computational task is broken down into sufficiently small subtasks. Each subtask is encapsulated into a mobile agent, which is then released on the grid and discovers computational resources using autonomous behavior. In the process of "colonization" of available resources, the judicious design of the agent behavior produces the emergence of crucial properties of the computation that can be tailored to specific classes of applications. We demonstrate this concept with a reduced-scale proof-of-concept implementation that executes a data-intensive independent-task application on a set of heterogeneous, geographically distributed machines. We present a detailed exploration of the design space of our system and a performance evaluation of our implementation using metrics appropriate for assessing self-organizing desktop grids.},

  abstract={Smart contracts are programs that reside within decentralized blockchains and are executed pursuant to triggered instructions. A smart contract acts in a similar way to a traditional agreement but negates the necessity for the involvement of a third party. Smart contracts are capable of initiating their commands automatically, thus eliminating the involvement of a regulatory body. As a consequence of blockchain's immutable feature, smart contracts are developed in a manner that is distinct from traditional software. Once deployed to the blockchain, a smart contract cannot be modified or updated for security patches, thus encouraging developers to implement strong security strategies before deployment in order to avoid potential exploitation at a later time. However, the most recent dreadful attacks and the multifarious existing vulnerabilities which result as a consequence of the absence of security patches have challenged the sustainability of this technology. Attacks such as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack and the Parity Wallet hack have cost millions of dollars simply as a consequence of naïve bugs in the smart contract code. In this paper, we classify blockchain exploitation techniques into 4 categories based on the attack rationale; attacking consensus protocols, bugs in the smart contract, malware running in the operating system, and fraudulent users. We then focus on smart contract vulnerabilities, analyzing the 7 most important attack techniques to determine the real impact on smart contract technology. We reveal that even adopting the 10 most widely used tools to detect smart contract vulnerabilities, these still contain known vulnerabilities, providing a dangerously false sense of security. We conclude the paper with a discussion about recommendations and future research lines to progress towards a secure smart contract solution.},

  abstract={Some open systems must address a standard resource allocation problem: how to collectivise and distribute a set of common-pool resources, with respect to multiple criteriasuch as fairness, inclusivity and sustainability. Previous work in self-organising multi-agent systems formalised Nicholas Rescher's theory of distributive justice so that agents could self-organise the allocation according to contextualised legitimate claims. However, although this presented a viable solution in principle, in practicethe process contained two 'expensive' voting rounds and an(albeit elected) centralised 'head' role, compromising parallelism, scalability and security. This in turn could be a hindrance to its application in large, real-life systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution to the problem, based on direct interaction between agents in a decentralised manner. Instead of voting, we develop an autonomous mechanism of trust and reputation calculated independently by each agent from its local observationsand interactions. Simulations demonstrate the efficiencyand effectiveness of the new solution to find fair allocations indiverse scenarios, including situations with non-compliant agents. Moreover, the effect of topology on our algorithms capacity isexamined, showing that it is possible to achieve fair solutions even when agents do not have direct access to the whole network.},

  abstract={Multirobot rendezvous control and coordination strategies have garnered significant interest in recent years because of their potential applications in decentralized tasks. In this paper, we introduce a coordinate-free rendezvous control strategy to enable multiple robots to gather at different locations (dynamic leader robots) by tracking their hierarchy in a connected interaction graph. A key novelty in this strategy is the gathering of robots in different groups rather than at a single consensus point, motivated by autonomous multipoint recharging and flocking control problems. We show that the proposed rendezvous strategy guarantees convergence and maintains connectivity while accounting for practical considerations such as robots with limited speeds and an obstacle-rich environment. The algorithm is distributed and handles minor faults such as a broken immobile robot and a sudden link failure. In addition, we propose an approach that determines the locations of rendezvous points based on the connected interaction topology and indirectly optimizes the total energy consumption for rendezvous in all robots. Through extensive experiments with the Robotarium multirobot testbed, we verified and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach and its properties.},

  abstract={Conjunction of massive amount of idle computers or resources that may be loosely coupled, heterogeneous and geographically dispersed to reach a common goal leads to a virtual computing platform for sharing resources across the world. Resource management, application development and usage models in these environments has some dilemma in undertaking resources due to resource providers with multiple administrative domains having their own policies and terms. A ditch in the Grid computing environment is how to coordinate the distributed resources amongst a dynamic set of individuals and organizations where the requesters and providers are allowed to join and leave Grid environment at any time. Bidding model prevents single point of failure and server overload problems of match making model while minimizing turnaround time by using some set of deterministic and probabilistic selection heuristics where resource requesters and resource providers were given the privilege to take autonomous decisions regarding resource selection. Autonomous decision making is enabled via peer-to-peer decentralized scheduling frame work. In decentralized environment, lack of global information is a key challenge to facilitate optimum decision making which can lead to greedy selection of the best provider. Therefore some probabilistic selection is used to reduce the fairness deviation among processors while minimizing the turnaround time. Currently just various level of information about providers has been concentrated to minimize the turnaround time. Simply concentrating on various level of information may also leads to failure due to rejection factor resulted by number of failures occurred at provider. However by merging trust oriented mechanisms along with various level of information, rejection factor can also be minimized along with minimization of the turnaround time.},

  abstract={The fast proliferation of digital twin (DT) establishes a direct connection between the physical entity and its deployed digital representation. As markets shift toward mass customization and new service delivery models, the digital representation has become more adaptive and agile by forming digital twin networks (DTNs). The DTN institutes a real-time single source of truth everywhere. However, there are several issues preventing DTNs from further application, including centralized processing, data falsification, privacy leakage, lack of incentive mechanism, and so on. To make DTN better meet the ever changing demands, we propose a novel block-chain-enabled adaptive asynchronous federated learning (FedTwin) paradigm for privacy-preserving and decentralized DTNs. We design Proof-of-Federalism (PoF), which is a tailor-made consensus algorithm for autonomous DTNs. In each DT's local training phase, generative adversarial network enhanced differential privacy is used to protect the privacy of local model parameters, while a modified Isolation Forest is deployed to filter out the falsified DTs. In the global aggregation phase, an improved Markov decision process is leveraged to select optimal DTs to achieve adaptive asynchronous aggregation while providing a rollback mechanism to redact the falsified global models. With this article, we aim to provide insights to forthcoming researchers and readers in this under-explored domain.},

  pages={464-469},
  abstract={This paper discusses the nature of the paradigm shift that will be accelerated as the next-generation Internet (NGI) pervades society. First, we define the NGI society as one in which the network is so ubiquitous that no one will be conscious of connecting with it. Then we investigate trends and expectations of current NGI research and development projects worldwide. Secondly, we have performed comprehensive questionnaire-based market research into new technologies. This reveals that Japan can be expected to create global markets by developing NGI applications in home-electronic appliances, mobile assistants, transportation systems, and animation games. Furthermore, we generalize the discussion on the nature of the paradigm shift as follows. Although modern western rationalism produced the astonishing growth of the industrialized countries in the 19th-20th centuries, this approach alone no longer offers the prospect of much further advance. The 21st century paradigm for science and technology, for social, economic and governmental systems, and for industrial structures and working styles will necessarily shift towards autonomous and cooperative decentralization. The Internet is a decentralized computer system that is operated autonomously and cooperatively by individuals and small organizations. The NGI will further accelerate this paradigm shift. We conclude that this approach is essentially similar to the traditional oriental philosophy of harmony, and urge that it should be adopted in positioning Japan within the global, information-oriented network society of the 21st century.},

  abstract={Man-made self-organizing systems date back to antiquity; for example, elaborate water clocks found from Alexandria (Ctesibius's clepsydra) to Seoul (King Sejong's Chagyongnu) were designed to keep constant rates or strike at regular time intervals without human adjustment. More modern examples include Watt's centrifugal governor, Black's negative feedback amplifier, and Nyquist's stability test, which enabled engineered systems to stabilize themselves. These and numerous innovations in control theory and engineering optimization have contributed much to modern communications technology. But there is a need for advances in both methods and applications beyond what has been achieved in the precise settings of mechanical, electronic, and optical switching and transmission towards the self-management and control of large-scale systems with many interacting and semi-autonomous components. Natural phenomena may be a guide for us, a model for self-organized decentralized systems. Spontaneous magnetization, crystallization, lasers, and superconductivity are examples of structural self-organization in physics where cohesive behavior emerges from initial disorder. In self-assembly and auto-catalytic networks in chemistry, molecules organize themselves in well-ordered arrangements without external action, and in biology, we observe highly complex coordinated action as in the folding of proteins, homeostasis, and flocking.},

In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases - Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

  abstract={Intelligent management of power flow and storage balance has proven its worth in supporting economic, sustainable operation of microgrids powered mainly by intermittent renewable energy resources. In particular, the introduction of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to solve power management and storage balance problems has been very successful. MARL primary-secondary control was the subject of a recent application in solving power storage flow problems in battery-based micro- and smart-grids, focusing upon vehicle-to-grid applications under realistic environmental considerations such as infrastructural influences. Such influences can worsen the accuracy of plug-and-play batteries' charge-discharge synchronization and hence control stabilization, power flow balance, batteries' health/life, and energy efficiency. This paper proposes a solution to this issue in a DC autonomous microgrid with multiple, heterogeneous batteries. Multiagent-neighbor-to-neighbor information is exploited to enhance the real-time balance of the load participation, and a real-time decentralized infrastructure compensation and power flow organization consumption/loss is established to compensate for infrastructural/environmental influence on the control. Moreover, implementation in a real-time economic sustainable participation policy on each BESS in a test microgrid is explored. The results verify improved synchronization of the batteries’ power flow with reduced plug-and-play time by (4.16%), enhanced output voltage balance by (2.76-8%), reduced power consumption by (1.908-2.94%), improved power flow balance by (2.765-6.486%), and better power flow efficiency by (0.9196-2.626%) when compared to a baseline MARL implementation.},

  abstract={The use of blockchains is growing every day, and their utility has greatly expanded from sending and receiving crypto-coins to smart-contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations. Modern blockchains underpin a variety of applications: from designing a global identity to improving satellite connectivity. In our research we look at the ability of blockchains to store metadata in an increasing volume of transactions and with evolving focus of utilization. We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse.},

  abstract={A network community is a special sub-network that contains a group of nodes sharing similar linked patterns. A distributed network community mining problem (D-NCMP) is concerned with finding all such communities from a distributed network. A variety of applications in WWW and ad-hoc networks such as P2P and sensor networks can be formulated into DNCMPs, in which both resources and controls are distributed and/or decentralized. The problem is difficult for some existing methods to deal with because of the fact that their required global topological representations of distributed networks are hard to obtain. In this paper, we present an autonomy oriented computing (AOC) approach [15], in which the nodes and links of a distributed network are distributed among a group of autonomous agents that collectively find global communities hidden in the network. In doing so, the agents maintain only their respective local views and update them through a proposed self-organization process. The effectiveness of the AOC based approach has been validated using network examples.},

That is, the members of a decentralized system are, belong to, or represent different people or organizations. We use the term decentralized system to mean any system formed of autonomous entities, with a special interest in cases where the entities are heterogeneous. Autonomy here refers to the decision-making capacity of an entity, meaning that it decides for itself. In other words, autonomy reflects the freedom to act. Heterogeneity here refers to the design, construction, and configuration of an entity, meaning that it is potentially built on distinct grounds from any other entity. In other words, heterogeneity reflects the freedom of a designer to apply any reasoning method on any available information.},

  abstract={There has been a growing interest in adapting blockchain technologies to the specific needs of the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to develop a variety of blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications such as smart cities and Industry 4.0, where smart contracts play an important role. After briefly reviewing recent progress on BIoT, we explore the symbiosis of blockchain with other key technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, while putting our focus on the emerging Tactile Internet for advanced human-to-machine interaction. Our interest is in exploiting the concept of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which executes smart contracts and requires the involvement from humans to perform certain tasks that autonomous AI based software agents and robots themselves cannot do. In our search for synergies between human-agent-robot teamwork (HART) and the complementary strengths of the DAO, AI, and robots, we decentralize the Tactile Internet by leveraging mobile end-user equipment via partially or fully decentralized multi-access edge computing, and crowdsourcing of human expertise to decrease the completion time of physical tasks in the event of unreliable feedback forecasting of teleoperated robots. Finally, we aim at enhancing the human capabilities of unskilled crowd members by using our proposed nudge contract.},

  abstract={Briefing: The demand for food is tremendously increasing with the growth of the world population, which necessitates the development of sustainable agriculture under the impact of various factors, such as climate change. To fulfill this challenge, we are developing Metaverses for agriculture, referred to as AgriVerse, under our Decentralized Complex Adaptive Systems in Agriculture (DeCASA) project, which is a digital world of smart villages created alongside the development of Decentralized Sciences (DeSci) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) for Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSSs). Additionally, we provide the architectures, operating modes and major applications of DeCASA in Agri-Verse. For achieving sustainable agriculture, a foundation model based on ACP theory and federated intelligence is envisaged. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities.},
