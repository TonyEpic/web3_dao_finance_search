abstract = {This paper is concerned with the effects of computer technology on the exercise of ethical judgment in organizations. It is a study in descriptive ethics that seeks to identify and analyze organizational features that enhance or inhibit the making of ethical judgments. Computers occasion changes in the structure and functions of organizations, and thus may alter the conditions under which ethical judgments are made. After a brief survey of the effects of computers on organizations, a scheme for analyzing ethical conduct is presented. The paper concludes with a detailed example of the use of the concepts introduced.},

abstract = {Policies are a powerful means of expressing high-level, goal oriented parameters to manage the behavior of systems and users, and are thus valuable tools for autonomic management. However, the autonomic management of policies is in itself a challenging problem. Particularly, their applicability is typically limited in situations where management actions depend on dynamic system properties, which require adapting policy application thresholds and parameters without modifying absolute policy definition constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel policy definition framework that enables autonomic policy adaptation and proactive policy application, based on the online analysis and characterization of system operation and feedback events. Our approach is supported by a decentralized clustering mechanism and scalable distributed communication platform that together enable the online analysis of events and the efficient generation and enforcement of dynamic policies among distributed system components. We justify, with the evaluation of illustrative scenarios, the need for online data analysis for policy adaptation and the potential benefits of our approach.},

abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are decentralized digital tokens to represent the unique ownership of items. Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

abstract = {Gossip algorithms can provide online information about the availability and the state of the resources in supercomputers. These algorithms require minimal computing and storage capabilities at each node and when properly tuned, they are not expected to overload the nodes or the network that connects these nodes. These properties make gossip interesting for future exascale systems. This paper examines the overhead of a decentralized gossip algorithm on the performance of parallel MPI applications running on up to 8192 nodes of an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer. The applications that were used in the experiments include PTRANS and MPI-FFT from the HPCC benchmark suite as well as the coupled weather and cloud simulation model COSMO-SPECS+FD4. In most cases, no gossip overhead was observed when the gossip messages were sent at intervals of 256ms or more. As expected, the overhead that is observed at higher rates is sensitive to the communication pattern of the application and the amount of gossip information being circulated.},

abstract = {Autonomous driving technology has made significant progress in recent years due to the development and implementation of cutting-edge models for computer vision and deep learning. These advances have enabled the creation of autonomous vehicles that can navigate roads and make driving decisions without the need for human intervention. However, the use of sensors and cameras in these vehicles has raised concerns about privacy, as they capture a vast amount of data, including location-specific landmarks and personally identifiable information. The identification and obfuscation of such sensitive data during preprocessing can be a costly process. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a Swarm Learning-based training approach for autonomous driving systems. Swarm Learning involves sharing model learnings across nodes rather than raw data, which can help to protect privacy. In addition to addressing privacy concerns, this approach offers performance that is comparable to traditional training methods. It also exhibits improvements over other distributed machine learning techniques such as Federated Learning. Overall, the Swarm Learning approach presents a promising solution for the development of autonomous driving systems that maintain high performance while addressing privacy concerns. By sharing model learnings rather than raw data, Swarm Learning helps to protect sensitive information and reduces the risk of privacy breaches. This approach offers a viable alternative to traditional training methods, enabling the creation of autonomous driving systems that are both effective and respectful of privacy.},

abstract = {Decentralised learning is attracting more and more interest because it embodies the principles of data minimisation and focused data collection, while favouring the transparency of purpose specification (i.e., the objective for which a model is built). Cloud-centric-only processing and deep learning are no longer strict necessities to train high-fidelity models; edge devices can actively participate in the decentralised learning process by exchanging meta-level information in place of raw data, thus paving the way for better privacy guarantees. In addition, these new possibilities can relieve the network backbone from unnecessary data transfer and allow it to meet strict low-latency requirements by leveraging on-device model inference. This survey provides a detailed and up-to-date overview of the most recent contributions available in the state-of-the-art decentralised learning literature. In particular, it originally provides the reader audience with a clear presentation of the peculiarities of federated settings, with a novel taxonomy of decentralised learning approaches, and with a detailed description of the most relevant and specific system-level contributions of the surveyed solutions for privacy, communication efficiency, non-IIDness, device heterogeneity, and poisoning defense.},

This paper presents the design and implementation of GroupCast - a utility-aware middleware architecture for scalable and efficient P2P group communications. The GroupCast design is characterized by two unique features. First, we present a utility function for quantifying the role of unicast links in enhancing the scalability and efficiency of the group communication applications. Second, we develop a utility-aware distributed spanning tree construction algorithm for efficiently propagating group communication messages. It dynamically creates and maintains the group communication channels by optimizing the utility value of the group communication spanning trees. In addition, we also outline a utility-based overlay management protocol for constructing and maintaining low-diameter overlay networks. Our experiments show that the GroupCast system can improve the scalability of wide-area group communication services by one to two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Decentralized applications (dApps) consist of smart contracts that run on blockchains and clients that model collaborating parties. dApps are used to model financial and legal business functionality. Today, contracts and clients are written as separate programs—in different programming languages—communicating via send and receive operations. This makes distributed program flow awkward to express and reason about, increasing the potential for mismatches in the client-contract interface, which can be exploited by malicious clients, potentially leading to huge financial losses.In this article, we present Prisma , a language for tierless decentralized applications, where the contract and its clients are defined in one unit and pairs of send and receive actions that “belong together” are encapsulated into a single direct-style operation, which is executed differently by sending and receiving parties. This enables expressing distributed program flow via standard control flow and renders mismatching communication impossible. We prove formally that our compiler preserves program behavior in presence of an attacker controlling the client code. We systematically compare Prisma with mainstream and advanced programming models for dApps and provide empirical evidence for its expressiveness and performance.},

The “Kyoto Protocol '' of 1997 introduced the need for a mechanism to trade grants issued, allowing the restricted emissions of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and creating an ecosystem for trading the surplus and deficiency of these credits/grants. This study aims at making this trade fraud free by using the powerful features of the blockchain like that of decentralization and a trustless environment by using different smart contracts that operate between multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem, the first contract creates a distributed ledger register for stakeholders, next quantifies CO2 consumptions and mints carbon tokens, third helps in verification of CO2 consumptions and the final contract is a DAO for voting on governance issues. Thus, this work proposes a blockchain based solution for trading of carbon credits to solve the problem of climate change.},

Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) are a general, principled model well-suited for such decentralized multiagent decision-making problems. In this paper, we investigate Dec-POMDPs for decentralized information gathering problems. An optimal solution of a Dec-POMDP maximizes the expected sum of rewards over time. To encourage information gathering, we set the reward as a function of the agents' state information, for example the negative Shannon entropy. We prove that if the reward is convex, then the finite-horizon value function of the corresponding Dec-POMDP is also convex. We propose the first heuristic algorithm for information gathering Dec-POMDPs, and empirically prove its effectiveness by solving problems an order of magnitude larger than previous state-of-the-art.},

The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the autonomy approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.},

abstract = {The Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems (AAMAS) conference series brings together researchers from around the world to share the latest advances in the field. It is the premier forum for research in the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. AAMAS 2002, the first of the series, was held in Bologna, followed by Melbourne (2003), New York (2004), Utrecht (2005), Hakodate (2006), Honolulu (2007), Estoril (2008), Budapest (2009), Toronto (2010), Taipei (2011), Valencia (2012), Saint Paul (2013), Paris (2014), Istanbul (2015), and Singapore (2016). This volume constitutes the proceedings of AAMAS 2017, the sixteenth conference in the series, held in S\~{a}o Paulo in May 2017.AAMAS 2017 invited submissions for a general track and five special tracks: Innovative Applications, Robotics, Embodied Virtual Agents and Human-Agent Interaction, and Blue Sky Ideas, along with a track to present papers from JAAMAS (the Journal of Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems) that had not previously been presented at a major conference. The special tracks were chaired by leading researchers in their corresponding fields: Paul Scerri and Pradeep Varakantham chaired the Innovative Applications track, Chris Amato and Alessandro Farinelli the Robotics track, Catherine Pelachaud the Embodied Virtual Agents and Human-Agent Interaction track, and Vincent Conitzer the Blue Sky Ideas track. One of us (Kate Larson) solicited papers for the JAAMAS Presentation Track from the papers that appeared in JAAMAS from the preceding 12 months.Jointly with the program chairs, the special track chairs were responsible for appointing the Senior Program Committee (SPC) members, who in turn helped identify the strong and diverse Program Committee (PC) members for their tracks. Every paper was reviewed by at least 3 PC members, overseen by an SPC member who ensured reviews were clear and informative. After authors were given an opportunity to respond to the reviewers, the SPC member led a discussion where the reviewers considered each others', and the authors', comments to converge on a recommendation to the Track chairs. The Track chairs in turn worked with the program chairs to make final decisions about acceptance for the papers, to ensure uniformly high quality. The JAAMAS presentation Track submissions published as extended abstracts were handled by the track chair.AAMAS 2017 attracted a good number of high-quality submissions: the overall acceptance rate for full papers was 27\% (155 out of 567 submissions were accepted) and for extended abstracts was 21\%. Of the 567 submissions, 356 (63\%) had a student as the primary author, and 82 of these (23\%) were accepted as full papers, and an additional 91 (26\%) as extended abstracts.While all the accepted papers are of very high quality, a select few were nominated for the Best Paper Award and the Pragnesh Jay Modi Best Student Paper Award. The Best Paper Award was presented at the conference to the best paper, and the Pragnesh Jay Modi Best Student Paper Award was given to the best of the remaining papers primarily authored by a student.

abstract = {Dynamic wireless networks, and especially mobile ad hoc networks, have imposed new constraints regarding the design and the implementation of service-oriented middleware platforms dedicated to mobile computing. Indeed, from now, these platforms must be able to capture the context in which they operate in order to provide the services they host with an abstraction of their running context, and to notify them of the variations occurring in this context. These middleware platforms must also implement communication means enabling services to support the frequent and unpredictable connection disruptions. In this paper, we present the design and the implementation of a service-oriented middleware platform capable of environmental context introspection and of delay-tolerant asynchronous communications.},

Currently, Blockchain operates like information isolated island, they cannot obtain external data or execute transactions on their own.Motivated by recent studies [1-3] on blockchain's multiChain framework, we investigate the cross-chain communication. We introduces blockchain router, which empowers blockchains to connect and communicate cross chains. By establishing an economic model, blockchain router enables different blockchains in the network communicate with each other same like Internet network. In the network of blockchain router, some blockchain plays the role of a router which, according to the communication protocol, analyzes and transmits communication requests, dynamically maintaining a topology structure of the blockchain network.},

abstract = {Agriculture is the lifeline of Indian economy which contributes to 22\% of the GDP, provides 58\% employment, and sustains 69\% of the population. However, agricultural production comes with various risk factors beyond human control. Farmers are highly exposed to risk and it is aggravated by the limited span of risk mitigation instruments such as insurance where there is a lack of participation from the private sector and the claim payout procedure is very lengthy, due to which the farmer cannot initiate new cropping activity or it is delayed. There is no proper and adequate provision of security for crops grown by Indian farmers and despite increasing vulnerability, they have not yet fully developed the capacity to mitigate risk effectively. There is a need to design innovative insurance products to balance the interests of the insurer as well as the insured. With the Prime Minister's call to be "self sufficient" or "aatmanirbhar", in this paper we present a decentralised peer-to-peer crop insurance framework which enables to overcome the current disadvantages by securing farmers' interests, eliminating intermediaries and providing a secure, standardized, and transparent system that does not hinder any information from stakeholders. Through blockchain technology, the system promotes trust in a trust less environment wherein the farmers and the private investors go into a contract. The investors pool their investments and provide cover for the farmers, thus help the nation become self sufficient and help the farmers prosper.},

However, similar treatment of multi-agent systems is lacking. A recent complexity result, showing that solving decentralized MDPs is NEXP-hard, provides a partial explanation. To overcome this complexity barrier, we identify a general class of transition-independent decentralized MDPs that is widely applicable. The class consists of independent collaborating agents that are tied together through a global reward function that depends upon both of their histories. We present a novel algorithm for solving this class of problems and examine its properties. The result is the first effective technique to solve optimally a class of decentralized MDPs. This lays the foundation for further work in this area on both exact and approximate solutions.},

The purpose of the paper then is to explore this idea built upon our unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm model and simulation that uses autonomous self-organized concepts. The specific objective is to re-engineer this UAV foundation based upon a formal design model with focus on bio-inspired agent attack through emergent control structures. The overall design approach should give UAVs or generic agents the ability to not only react to dynamic environments but develop the controls in order to change behaviors spontaneously. To allow these behaviors to properly evolve, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm generates a self-organized rule-based agent swarm. Heterogeneous UAV swarms are tested against difficult targeting scenarios that evolve specific attack behaviorial techniques. Statistical observations indicate that bio-inspired techniques integrated with the emerging entangled (non-hierarchical) framework provide desired complex UAV swarming behaviors in dynamic environments.},

This perspective assumes an intended primacy of the people in the citizen−government relationship and perceives the marginalization of humans as a significant threat to applying social values in governance, especially when situated action is required. Using Mintzberg's models of managing government, we identify a variety of ‘monster’ challenges, point to opportunities for decomposition of human and machine agency and advocate the alignment and composition of both agencies as a long-term learning process that involves both citizens and technology and requires safeguarding by multiple stakeholders.},

abstract = {Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been designed to ensure the correctness and integrity of transaction and process management. A ledger maintains records of data transactions as well as assures the correct execution of processes attached to data. Consistency across processes and parties is achieved by means of consensus building. However, scalability is a major concern when and significant amounts of data need confirmation. When digitalizing existing business processes with serious amounts of data, scalability becomes a pivotal objective. Hence, technical means for information compression become a vital asset. This paper presents a novel approach for data aggregation. On the one hand, data are aggregated in order to merely maintain an audit certificate of the aggregate on the ledger. On the other hand, provenance of raw data aggregated can be traced and proven correctly. Hence, audit services for information exchange in business relationships can scale, while raw data of supplier parties must not be unveiled in detail. We present a novel architecture for efficient data aggregation, while ensuring smart contracts and their main functionality of processing relevant process data. German waterway transportation serves as evaluation scenario. Moreover, decentral identity management is introduced as anchor element of our DLT-enabled ecosystem for business collaboration. Hence, preserving sovereignty and safety of personal data can be assured for M2M economies.},

Among them, crowd journalism represents a novel way of constructing democratic and trustworthy news relying on ordinary citizens arriving at breaking news locations and capturing relevant videos using their smartphones. The ARTICONF project [1] proposes a trustworthy, resilient, and globally sustainable toolset for developing decentralized applications (DApps). Leveraging the ARTICONF tools, we introduce a new DApp for crowd journalism called MOGPlay. MOGPlay collects and manages audio-visual content generated by citizens and provides a secure blockchain platform that rewards all stakeholders involved in professional news production. Besides live streaming, MOGPlay offers a marketplace for audio-visual content trading among citizens and free journalists with an internal token ecosystem. We discuss the functionality and implementation of the MOGPlay DApp and illustrate three pilot crowd journalism live scenarios that validate the prototype.},

Much work in recent years has focused on optimizing machine learning models to low-power systems, typically to locally process sensor data. Significantly less attention has been paid to other artificial intelligence fields such as knowledge representation and automated reasoning, which may contribute to building autonomous devices. In this work, we present a low-power sensor node with an autonomous belief-desire-intention agent. This kind of agent simplifies the implementation of both proactive and reactive behaviors, promoting autonomy in our target applications. It does so by locally perceiving and reasoning, and then wirelessly broadcasting an intention, which can be forwarded to an actuator. The capabilities of the autonomous agent are demonstrated with a light-control application. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of running intelligent agents in low-power platforms with little overhead.},

This paper presents the design and implementation of GroupCast -- a utility-aware middleware architecture for scalable and efficient P2P group communications. The GroupCast design is characterized by two unique features. First, we present a utility function for quantifying the role of unicast links in enhancing the scalability and efficiency of the group communication applications. Second, we develop a utility-aware distributed spanning tree construction algorithm for efficiently propagating group communication messages. It dynamically creates and maintains the group communication channels by optimizing the utility value of the group communication spanning trees. In addition, we also outline a utility-based overlay management protocol for constructing and maintaining low-diameter overlay networks. Our experiments show that the GroupCast system can improve the scalability of wide-area group communication services by one to two orders of magnitude.},

We faced different design choices, integration challenges and a substantial learning curve in realizing a decentralized, scalable, and easy-to-use solution. In our solution, Android devices in the vicinity of the hazardous weather event can post timely data to a server, including the approximate location of the severe weather incident, and where the server, in turn, can distribute messages scalably to relevant Android devices. The use case for this research was severe weather alerting, however, we surmise that the basic patterns and design choices used in the mobile application design can be used in other related scenarios.},

abstract = {Autonomous Unmanned Systems (AUSs) emerge to replace human operators for better efficiency and effectiveness, especially in harsh and dangerous environments which frequently imply uncertainty. Safety has become one of the top concerns for AUS designs. To address AUS safety concerns systematically, we aim to establish a comprehensive taxonomy of AUS safety and provide a safety-by-design framework for architecting safer AUSs. We conduct a systematic literature review on 65 primary studies and analyze them from three perspectives: system and environment features, safety threats, and countermeasures. We adopt feature models to organize the survey results and establish a taxonomy for AUSs safety issues. Based on the taxonomy, we figure out a reference architecture that integrates three control loops dealing with the uncertainty of operating environments, external threats and system deviations, respectively. Our survey reveals that AUS safety is still a formative field and presents a taxonomy for AUSs safety issues and a safe-by-design framework for architecting safer AUSs.},

abstract = {Originally designed for the management of network-attached devices OSGi builds a de-facto standard to modularise all kinds of complex Java applications. It enables deployment and updating of components, which are called bundles, by supporting automatic resolution of inter-component dependencies. Despite these benefits the OSGi specification omits dedicated support for discovery, selection and loading of locally unavailable bundles. However, this is a key requirement for large distributed applications especially in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. Current solutions are server-based and provide a central bundle repository thereby representing a single point of failure. Furthermore, these approaches lack support for automatic bundle selection based on non-functional properties such as resource demand or performance.We introduce the D2CM infrastructure accounting these issues and enabling automatic discovery, selection and loading of bundles in a distributed system on basis of the peer-to-peer platform JXTA. By providing extended bundle descriptions, non-functional properties can be automatically evaluated for bundle selection and dependency resolution.},

Being naturally distributed and composed of multiple entities and users, these problems clearly fit the multiagent paradigm, and may challenge researchers for many years.},

Non-fungible tokens are a recent example, as they allow a decentralized way to generate and verify proof of ownership via distributed ledger technology. Despite crucial uncertainties, these tokens have generated great enthusiasm for the future of digital property and its surrounding economy. In this regard, I think there is an untapped opportunity in applying a hypertext approach to augment such highly structured ownership-based associations. To this end, in this work I propose hyperownership, based on the premises that property is the law of lists and ledgers, and that hypertext is an apt method to inquiry such a ledger system. In spite of the significant risks and challenges to realize such a vision, I believe that it has great potential to transform the way with which we interact with digital property.},

abstract = {The endeavor to find appropriate data governance frameworks capable of reconciling conflicting interests in data has dramatically gained importance across disciplines and has been discussed among legal scholars, computer scientists as well as policy-makers alike. The predominant part of the current discussion is centered around the challenging task of creating a data governance framework where data is ‘as open as possible and as closed as necessary’. In this article, we elaborate on modern approaches to data governance and their limitations. It analyses how propositions evolved from property rights in data towards the creation of data access and data sharing obligations and how the corresponding debates reflect the difficulty of developing approaches that reconcile seemingly opposite objectives – such as giving individuals and businesses more control over ‘their’ data while at the same time ensuring its availability to different stakeholders. Furthermore, we propose a wider acknowledgement of data collaboratives powered by decentralised learning techniques as a possible remedy to the shortcomings of current data governance schemes. Hence, we propose a mild formalization of the set of existing technological solutions that could inform existing approaches to data governance issues. Our proposition is based on an abstractive notion of collaborative computation as well as on several principles that are essential for our definition of data collaboratives. By adopting an interdisciplinary perspective on data governance, this article highlights how innovative technological solutions can enhance control over data while at the same time ensuring its availability to other stakeholders and thereby contributing to the achievement of the policy goals of the European Strategy for Data.},

This will raise the need to coordinate their movements in order to properly handle both access to shared resources (e.g., intersections and parking slots) and the execution of mobility tasks (e.g., platooning and ramp merging). The aim of this article is to provide a global view of the coordination issues and the related solutions in the field of autonomous vehicles. To this end, we firstly introduce the general problems associated with coordination of autonomous vehicles by identifying and framing the key classes of coordination problems. Then, we overview the different approaches that can be adopted to deal with such problems by classifying them in terms of the degree of autonomy in decision making that is left to autonomous vehicles during the coordination process. Finally, we overview some further research challenges to address before autonomous coordinated vehicles can safely hit our streets.},

abstract = {Deploying virtual organizations (VOs) is difficult for small- and medium-scale collaborations: the overheads in establishing and managing trust, and in deploying and managing computational resources distributed across multiple organizations are daunting to many potential users, presenting a barrier to entry that significantly hinders wider deployment of VOs. We advocate an approach where social networking and self-configuring overlay virtual networks are integrated in a novel way that allows simple deployment and management of ad-hoc infrastructures for VOs. There are three central principles in our approach: (1) user relationships which have been increasingly recorded in social networking systems provide the opportunity to bootstrap trust relationships; (2) connections established at a social networking layer can efficiently be mapped to the IP layer of virtual network overlays to support existing TCP/IP applications for collaboration and resource sharing while maintaining security against untrusted parties; and (3) systems integrating social and virtual networks can be self-configuring, enabling deployment of collaborative infrastructures by non-experts. We discuss motivations for this approach, describe a prototype implementation which integrates the Facebook social network and the IPOP overlay network, and discuss a use case scenario towards ad-hoc social cycle-sharing virtual Condor pools.},

abstract = {Owing to the advancements in communication and computation technologies, the dream of commercialized connected and autonomous cars is becoming a reality. However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication. To date, a plethora of research work has already been done covering different aspects of carpooling services (ranging from applications to communication and technologies); however, there is still a lack of a holistic, comprehensive survey that can be a one-stop-shop for the researchers in this area to (i) find all the relevant information and (ii) identify the future research directions. To fill these research challenges, this article provides a comprehensive survey on carpooling in autonomous and connected vehicles and covers architecture, components, and solutions, including scheduling, matching, mobility, pricing models of carpooling. We also discuss the current challenges in carpooling and identify future research directions. This survey is aimed to spur further discussion among the research community for the effective realization of carpooling.},

abstract = {The Decentralised Web (DW) has recently seen a renewed momentum, with a number of DW platforms like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Hubzilla gaining increasing traction. These offer alternatives to traditional social networks like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, by enabling the operation of web infrastructure and services without centralised ownership or control. Although their services differ greatly, modern DW platforms mostly rely on two key innovations: first, their open source software allows anybody to setup independent servers ("instances") that people can sign-up to and use within a local community; and second, they build on top of federation protocols so that instances can mesh together, in a peer-to-peer fashion, to offer a globally integrated platform.In this paper, we present a measurement-driven exploration of these two innovations, using a popular DW microblogging platform (Mastodon) as a case study. We focus on identifying key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to decentralise the web, and empirically highlight a number of properties that are creating natural pressures towards re-centralisation. Finally, our measurements shed light on the behaviour of both administrators (i.e., people setting up instances) and regular users who sign-up to the platforms, also discussing a few techniques that may address some of the issues observed.},
