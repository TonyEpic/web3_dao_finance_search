abstract = {The construction industry is a $6 trillion industry worldwide with a prediction to grow towards $10,3 trillion by 2023 and constitutes an essential part of the global economy. Nevertheless, the management of the construction effort is still very manual. The construction process from design, to sourcing of material, contract management, and so on, is a convoluted and intransparent process filled with risks the collaborating parties are exposed to. A need exists for management platforms that streamline and automate collaborative construction processes, establish transparency, traceability, and information symmetry between business parties. This paper presents the Construction Project Management (CoPM) platform that is based on blockchain- and smart-contract technologies for enabling peer-to-peer collaboration between construction parties that enhances the flow of information for reducing cost- and time expenditures while improving the quality of service. The CoPM system is based on diligent up-front requirement studies from which we derive a coherent system architecture and set of cooperation protocols. Thereby, the CoPM system overcomes the currently existing fractured value propositions for construction-management systems.CCS Concepts •Software and its engineering•Software creation and management•Designing software},

abstract = {Blockchain Technologies, known as BCT have been praised by most people as a new and revolutionary means of ensuring secure and transparent data sharing and record keeping with potential uses in a number of sectors. The government sector is one of them. The potentials of DLTs are among the motivating reasons why most government agencies are looking to this technology to help make them become more efficient, accountable, cost-effective, and transparent. Some, on the other hand, are looking for ways in which the DLTs can help increase the trust in government agencies as well as various governmental institutions. Despite the endless potentials of the DLTs, they are still in infant stage and at the same time having a number of risks that may deter its future integration and use. This paper proposes a framework towards the integration of DLTs into government organizations of various levels like municipalities and public services that will help in introduction of them in governmental tasks such as digital ID management, secure document handling and voting while keeping them simple for administrators to use and apply in every organization and domain.},

abstract = {Spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) techniques can aid in debugging, but their practicality in industrial settings has been limited due to the large number of tests needed to execute before applying SBFL. Previous research has explored different trigger modes for SBFL and found that applying it immediately after the first test failure is also effective. However, this study only considered single-location bugs, while multi-location bugs are prevalent in real-world scenarios and especially at our company Cvent, which is interested in integrating SBFL to its CI/CD workflow.  

In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of SBFL on multi-location bugs and propose a framework called Instant Fault Localization for Multi-location Bugs (IFLM). We compare and evaluate four trigger modes of IFLM using open-source (Defects4J) and close-source (Cvent) bug datasets.  

Our study showed that it is not necessary to execute all test cases before applying SBFL. However, we also found that that applying SBFL right after the first failed test is less effective than applying it after executing all tests for multi-location bugs, which is contrary to the single-location bug study. We also observe differences in performance between real and artificial bugs. Our contributions include the development of IFLM and CVent bug datasets, analysis of SBFL effectiveness for multi-location bugs, and practical implications for integrating SBFL in industrial environments.},

Existing datasets are imbalanced both in frequency of class but also in intra-class difficulty which we demonstrate is a barrier for curriculum learning. We thus propose a novel curriculum augmentation scheme that aims to address frequency and difficulty imbalances implicitly which are are terming Curriculum Learning by Augmentation (CLbA). Using Curriculum Learning by Augmentation (CLbA), we achieve a state-of-the-art performance of mean Average Precision (mAP) 0.971 using ResNet-18 up from the previous state-of-the-art of mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.757 using DenseNet-121 whilst outcompeting Curriculum Learning by Bootstrapping (CLbB) by a significant margin with improved calibration. This new training scheme thus allows the use of smaller and more performant Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones fulfilling Nyquist criteria to achieve a sampling frequency of 102.3Hz. This paves the way for inference of blinking in real-time applications.},

abstract = {Today, many smartphone users are unaware of what applications apps they should stop using to prevent their battery from running out quickly. The problem is identifying such apps is hard due to the fact that there exist hundreds of thousands of apps and their impact on the battery is not well understood. We show via extensive measurement studies that the impact of an app on battery consumption depends on both environmental wireless factors and usage patterns. Based on this, we argue that there exists a critical need for a tool that allows a user to: 1 identify apps that are energy hungry and 2 understand why an app is consuming energy, on her phone. Toward addressing this need, we present TIDE, a tool to detect high energy apps on any particular smartphone. TIDE’s key characteristic is that it accounts for usage-centric information while identifying energy hungry apps from among a multitude of apps that run simultaneously on a user’s phone. Our evaluation of TIDE on a test bed of Android-based smartphones, using week-long smartphone usage traces from 17 real users, shows that TIDE correctly identifies over 94\% of energy-hungry apps and has a false positive rate of &lt; 6\%.},

abstract = {This presentation discusses the NASA data assimilation project at the Data Assimilation Office at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. The goal is to produce accurate gridded datasets of atmospheric fields by assimilating a range of observations along with physically consistent model forecasts. This work produces datasets that are used by the climate research community. The data come from conventional sources that are used for weather forecasts (e.g., radiosondes, earth-surface measurements, and satellite temperature retrievals), as well as new sources such as satellites that will be launched under the Mission To Planet Earth Enterprise. An end-to-end Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Data Assimilation System (DAS) currently supports stratospheric flight missions and reanalysis projects for NASA. The current Core of this system (Model, and Analysis) is a multitasking algorithm that runs on Cray J90 and C90 computers at Goddard and NASA Ames Research Center. Future Core computing will be carried out at Ames, with a new production system scheduled to be ready for the EOS AM-1 satellite launch in June of 1998. The DAO has acquired SGI Origin 2000 computers, with an aggregate of 160 processors in place at Ames, and more planned for the future. The DAO is currently updating the control scripts and programs, and implementing a modular Fortran 90 Core system. During 1998 the Core system will be migrated to distributed-memory software using the Message Passing Interface. Part of this work is being carried out under the NASA High Performance Computing and Communications Earth and Space Sciences program. The algorithmic and performance issues involved in Core system are the main subject of this presentation.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is known as a degenerative neurological progression that causes the loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex. The cognitive functions are gradually impaired over several to 20 years and no current cure. It is crucial for timely conversion prediction to AD in its earliest phrase. In this study, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) model to obtain biomarkers of brain and clinical diagnosis of each subject from only one to indefinitely forecast the biomarkers and clinical diagnosis at each timepoint in the future. However, unexpected missing observations is a common issue in longitudinal data. Moreover, in recurrent dynamical systems, gates should be closer to 1 to propagate more information from earlier time steps to later ones. Two strategies are explored to handle missing data and improve gating mechanisms in recurrent neural network to boost performance. Empirically, our gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance when longitudinal data is utilized. On the baseline dataset from The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) challenge, our proposal outperforms the conventional recurrent neural network in term of multi-class Area Under Curve (mAUC) which achieving 0.79734 ± 0.01785.},

abstract = {Improving driver behaviors through driving education and coaching is well-recognized as being necessary and efficient for driving safely and reducing traffic accidents, as they promise to reduce human factors accounting for most of the crash involvements. Driver education programs are currently widely employed in many countries, ensuring that the necessary procedural driving skills and competencies are imparted during these processes, to make more skilled drivers. However, making people more skilled drivers does not make them safer ones, the effectiveness of driving education is greatly restricted by the limited amount of actual supervised driving involved and the absence of individualized feedback. To this aim, driving coaching emerges as a more practical alternative to develop safely driving by proactively providing coaching feedback to enhance skills and cultivate corrective behaviors, with the recent technological developments in intelligent vehicles and transportation. This paper presents a systematic review of the existing studies for examining the empirical evidences on the various coaching explorations for the development of drivers’ procedural driving skills. In particular, we propose a taxonomy to classify existing driving coaching into four categories, and explore the answers to three questions: what types, when and how the different kinds of driving coaching are provided and delivered. Finally, the challenges and future directions are also presented from three aspects.},

As an answer to all these factors, several disruptive technologies that have come into focus during the last few years, as well as some alternative business models, must be considered as a part of Industry 4.0 and here, particularly, as a part of Car Industry 4.0. In this context, DLT is also seen as one of disruptive technologies. Therefore, this paper analyzes DLT as a part of a Car Industry 4.0 and their main properties.

abstract = {Today, digital platforms are increasingly mediating our day-to-day work and crowdsourced forms of labour are progressively gaining importance (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk, Universal Human Relevance System, TaskRabbit). In many popular cases of crowdsourcing, a volatile, diverse, and globally distributed crowd of workers compete among themselves to find their next paid task. The logic behind the allocation of these tasks typically operates on a “First-Come, First-Served” basis. This logic generates a competitive dynamic in which workers are constantly forced to check for new tasks. This article draws on findings from ongoing collaborative research in which we co-design, with crowdsourcing workers, three alternative models of task allocation beyond “First-Come, First-Served”, namely (1) round-robin, (2) reputation-based, and (3) content-based. We argue that these models could create fairer and more collaborative forms of crowd labour. We draw on Amara On Demand, a remuneration-based crowdsourcing platform for video subtitling and translation, as the case study for this research. Using a multi-modal qualitative approach that combines data from 10 months of participant observation, 25 semi-structured interviews, two focus groups, and documentary analysis, we observed and co-designed alternative forms of task allocation in Amara on Demand. The identified models help envision alternatives towards more worker-centric crowdsourcing platforms, understanding that platforms depend on their workers, and thus ultimately they should hold power within them.},

abstract = {Investigating the intangible nature of a cultural domain can take multiple forms, addressing, for example, the aesthetic, epistemic, and social dimensions of its phenomenology. The context of Southern Chinese martial arts is of particular significance, as it carries immaterial components of all these aspects: The technical and stylistic framework of a martial art system; the imagery associated to movements; and the transmission of knowledge orally, practically, or through influence, are but examples of intangible characteristics that can and should be captured, not unlike cultural artifacts. The latter case—the one of formalizing cultural influence through its various forms of evidenceis emblematic as well as largely untrodden ground. A previous attempt at detecting cultural influence computationally was made in the context of Roman archaeology, though the binding of that early effort with the domain model was tight; also, there has hardly been any prior dedicated effort to model the martial arts domain through ontologies. In this article, we present the realization of the full cycle of a computational approach to investigating cultural contact in Southern Chinese martial arts. The entire approach is predicated upon the usage of standards and techniques of the Semantic Web and formal knowledge. Starting from a modular domain ontology, which models martial arts independently of the goal of capturing cultural influence, we perform knowledge extraction from archival material from the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive and generate a dataset of the results modeled after said ontology. Then, we combine the resulting knowledge base with a rule model that represents ways to infer knowledge of potential contact between cultures based on the evidence present in the knowledge base. The results offer an insight into how an inference-based computational model can be applied to detect interesting facts even in the as-yet underexplored domain of intangible cultural heritage. The implemented workflow shows that the full-cycle employment of semantic technologies can offer the ground truth required for largely different approaches, such as statistical and machine learning ones, to operate.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that are stored and executed on the Blockchain and can receive, manage and transfer money (cryptocurrency units). Two important problems regarding smart contracts are formal analysis and compiler optimization. Formal analysis is extremely important, because smart contracts hold funds worth billions of dollars and their code is immutable after deployment. Hence, an undetected bug can cause significant financial losses. Compiler optimization is also crucial, because every action of a smart contract has to be executed by every node in the Blockchain network. Therefore, optimizations in compiling smart contracts can lead to significant savings in computation, time and energy.Two classical approaches in program analysis and compiler optimization are intraprocedural and interprocedural analysis. In intraprocedural analysis, each function is analyzed separately, while interprocedural analysis considers the entire program. In both cases, the analyses are usually reduced to graph problems over the control flow graph (CFG) of the program. These graph problems are often computationally expensive. Hence, there has been ample research on exploiting structural properties of CFGs for efficient algorithms. One such well-studied property is the treewidth, which is a measure of tree-likeness of graphs. It is known that intraprocedural CFGs of structured programs have treewidth at most 6, whereas the interprocedural treewidth cannot be bounded. This result has been used as a basis for many efficient intraprocedural analyses.In this paper, we explore the idea of exploiting the treewidth of smart contracts for formal analysis and compiler optimization. First, similar to classical programs, we show that the intraprocedural treewidth of structured Solidity and Vyper smart contracts is at most 9. Second, for global analysis, we prove that the interprocedural treewidth of structured smart contracts is bounded by 10 and, in sharp contrast with classical programs, treewidth-based algorithms can be easily applied for interprocedural analysis. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with experiments using a tool we implemented for computing treewidth of smart contracts and show that the treewidth is much lower in practice. We use 36,764 real-world Ethereum smart contracts as benchmarks and find that they have an average treewidth of at most 3.35 for the intraprocedural case and 3.65 for the interprocedural case.},

abstract = {This paper explores how Netflix has enhanced its animation production reporting using a dynamic data transformation framework. As collaborations with animation studios around the globe grow, it’s essential to adeptly manage varied reports to ensure projects stay on schedule and within financial constraints. Traditional reporting methods struggle to meet the demands of modern animation production. The framework we built at Netflix standardizes Animation Production Reporting at scale, by employing modern data processing techniques like Apache Spark and incorporating different layers such as parse, transform, and publish. This paper delves into the design of each layer and the abstractions used, making it feasible for animation studios globally to adopt our framework for reporting. Specific examples are provided to illustrate how these pipelines currently in production automate reporting, ensuring detailed assertions and sequence breakdown workflow.},

However, its inherent complexity can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. With the advent of large language models, many studies put a special focus on identifying vulnerabilities using these models. Nonetheless, language models are ineffective with the lengthy input sequences. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a novel multi-label vulnerability detection mechanism using pre-trained language model CodeT5+ combined with a unique multi-block fusion. The results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can achieve up to 0.998 F1-score and require only 0.39 ms of processing time on a collected dataset comprising 421,266 contracts from Ethereum.},

abstract = {Single Sign-On (SSO) enables users to access multiple websites and applications using a single set of login credentials. Undoubtedly, SSO makes it easy for users to log in to multiple websites without remembering credentials. However, it is also important to consider the potential risk of users being unaware of how the identity of their account will be utilized, the development of online tracking techniques, and any potential exchange of information with third parties without the user’s knowledge. In this paper, we propose SSOLogin, which enables us to perform large-scale automation of website login through an SSO account. We confirm that SSOLogin automatically logins to 91.8\% of SSO account available websites in Tranco Top 500 sites. Next, by crawling Tranco Top 10K websites with SSOLogin, we show that 1,420 sites (14.2\%) contain SSO login (Google and Facebook) as of July 2023, primarily on Information Technology and News/Media websites in the United States and the United Kingdom. We then shed light on the characteristics of privacy leakage of websites with SSO logins by setting up measurements in Japan. We find that 99\% of websites have third-party online tracking activities, which may pose risks to user privacy. After SSO login, the target website shows an increase in third-party tracking domains. Logging in with Google adds 81 new tracking domains, while Facebook adds 33 new domains. Despite the convenience of logging in with an SSO account, it is important to be aware of the potential privacy risks associated with this practice.},

abstract = {The increasing trend in the number of smart connected devices has turned the routing procedure as one of the major challenges in IoT infrastructures. The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) was introduced to satisfy different IoT application requirements through Objective Functions (OF). Although there have been several studies on introducing new OFs in order to fulfill specific IoT characteristics, e.g., energy and delay efficiency, reliability, and stability, but still there is a lack of novel OFs which fulfill the IoT application requirements in terms of both, the performance and the power consumption simultaneously. In this paper, we have proposed PEDAL, an OF which addresses the unexplored territory of power and performance aware OFs, by taking into account, both the power consumption and the End-to-End (E2E) delay in terms of Power-Delay Product (PDP). Our evaluation results on Contiki's IoT simulation environment (COOJA) has shown that PEDAL improves the PDP of the nodes by 42.2\%.},

abstract = {A smart contract cannot be modified once deployed. Bugs in deployed smart contracts may cause devastating consequences. For example, the infamous reentrancy bug in the DAO contract allows attackers to arbitrarily withdraw ethers, which caused millions of dollars loss. Currently, the main countermeasure against contract bugs is to thoroughly detect and verify contracts before deployment, which, however, cannot defend against unknown bugs. These detection methods also suffer from possible false negative results. In this paper, we propose SolSaviour, a framework for repairing and recovering deployed defective smart contracts by redeploying patched contracts and migrating old contracts’ internal states to the new ones. SolSaviour consists of a voteDestruct mechanism and a TEE cluster. The voteDestruct mechanism allows contract stake holders to decide whether to destroy the defective contract and withdraw inside assets. The TEE cluster is responsible for asset escrow, redeployment of patched contracts, and state migration. Our experiment results show that SolSaviour can successfully repair vulnerabilities, reduce asset losses, and recover all defective contracts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a defending mechanism for repairing and recovering deployed defective smart contracts.},

However, these techniques do not take into account the great variability of these architectures, and therefore limit the architectural options available for their users. We here describe a feature model that captures the architectural and technological variability of multilayer applications. Using this feature model as the core of a model-driven development process, we are able to incorporate architectural and technological variability into the model-based development of multilayer applications.

The amount of information on the internet is increasing, but its correctness and authenticity are not always guaranteed, leading to false information, fake news, etc. The mentioned problem negatively affects users' reception and use of information. Unlike deepfake, cheapfake is created using simple techniques and does not rely on AI to produce fake multimedia. Cheapfake is becoming increasingly popular due to its ease of creation. Thus, there is a growing need to develop techniques that can detect cheapfake content. Following previous events, the Grand Challenge on Detecting Cheapfakes at ACM ICMR 2024 continues to seek contributions from researchers on cheapfake detection with the goal of improving effectiveness and creativity in approach, and understanding the limitations of the current dataset. This challenge has accepted 6 new proposed methods from participants with the highest private test accuracies achieved at 72.2\% for Task 1 and 54.84\% for Task 2. The highest public test accuracies for the two tasks are 95.6\% and 93\% respectively. These new methods focus on incorporating new AI models such as Stable Diffusion, LLM.

abstract = {Graph Augmentation Learning (GAL) provides outstanding solutions for graph learning in handling incomplete data, noise data, etc. Numerous GAL methods have been proposed for graph-based applications such as social network analysis and traffic flow forecasting. However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of these GAL methods are still unclear. As a consequence, how to choose optimal graph augmentation strategy for a certain application scenario is still in black box. There is a lack of systematic, comprehensive, and experimentally validated guideline of GAL for scholars. Therefore, in this survey, we in-depth review GAL techniques from macro (graph), meso (subgraph), and micro (node/edge) levels. We further detailedly illustrate how GAL enhance the data quality and the model performance. The aggregation mechanism of augmentation strategies and graph learning models are also discussed by different application scenarios, i.e., data-specific, model-specific, and hybrid scenarios. To better show the outperformance of GAL, we experimentally validate the effectiveness and adaptability of different GAL strategies in different downstream tasks. Finally, we share our insights on several open issues of GAL, including heterogeneity, spatio-temporal dynamics, scalability, and generalization.},

abstract = {Support for distributed application management in large-scale networked environments remains in its early stages. Although a number of solutions exist for subtasks of application deployment, monitoring, and maintenance in distributed environments, few tools provide a unified framework for application management. Many of the existing tools address the management needs of a single type of application or service that runs in a specific environment, and these tools are not adaptable enough to be used for other applications or platforms. To this end, we present the design and implementation of Plush, a fully configurable application management infrastructure designed to meet the general requirements of several different classes of distributed applications. Plush allows developers to specifically define the flow of control needed by their computations using application building blocks. Through an extensible resource management interface, Plush supports execution in a variety of environments, including both live deployment platforms and emulated clusters. Plush also uses relaxed synchronization primitives for improving fault tolerance and liveness in failure-prone environments. To gain an understanding of how Plush manages different classes of distributed applications, we take a closer look at specific applications and evaluate how Plush provides support for each.},

abstract = {In recent years, blockchain has been growing rapidly from a niche technology to a promising solution for many sectors, due to its unique properties that empower the design of innovative applications. Nevertheless, the development of blockchain applications is still a challenge. Due to the technological novelty, only a few developers are familiar with blockchain technologies and smart contracts. Others might face a steep learning curve or difficulties to reuse existing code to build blockchain applications. This study proposes a novel approach to tackle these issues, through software product line engineering. To support the approach, a web platform to configure and generate a blockchain application for on-chain traceability is introduced. First, a feature model has been designed to model core features of the chosen domain, based on the existing literature. Then, a configurator has been implemented to support the feature selection phase. Finally, a generator is able to ingest such configurations to generate on-the-shelf blockchain products. The generalizability of the contribution is validated by reproducing on-chain traceability applications proposed in the literature by using the platform. This work provides the first evidence that the implementation of blockchain applications using software product lines enhances the quality of produced applications and reduces the time to market.},

Although a few research has been performed NER on COVID-19 scientific papers, very little is currently known concerning the behaviors of current entity recognition models in this new domain. Therefore, this ongoing study attempts to analyze current NER models’ performance and limitations on the CORD-19 dataset. By examining three NER models, this study showed that NER performance is improved with the similarity between the testing and pretraining data. When there are little manually annotated resources for COVID-19 NER exist, our analysis suggested that for training purposes, enhancing the dictionary for seed annotation is effective (not necessarily requiring costly human annotation).},

abstract = {There are many Internet of Things (IoT) applications which demand an infrastructure that requires significantly less energy and supports longer operation time. Such an infrastructure is provided by Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLN) that run on resource-constrained devices. Achieving an energy-efficient routing on such networks is a significant challenge which is addressed by the Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The specifications of RPL are depicted in RFC 6550 by IETF. Although RPL gives many benefits to LLN, at the same time, it also attracts many security issues. One such security issue is the Dropping Destination Advertisement Object (DDAO) attack. In RPL, a client node uses Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) control messages to pass the destination information to the root node. An attacker may exploit the DAO passing mechanism of RPL to deliberately drop DAO received from child nodes and send fake Destination Advertisement Object-Acknowledgement (DAO-ACK) messages to perform a DDAO attack. The existing research work provides only a detection algorithm to detect the DDAO attack. Therefore, in this research paper, we proposed a defense technique, i.e., lightweight Acknowledgement (ACK) authentication, based on a challenge-response strategy to mitigate the attack. For this, we have used a Prime Sequence Code Matrix (PSCM) and a modified version of the DAO and DAO-ACK control packet of the standard RPL. Our proposed technique reduces the impact of attack and restores network performance significantly.},

abstract = {Governance in online communities is an increasingly high-stakes challenge, and yet many basic features of offline governance legacies-juries, political parties, term limits, and formal debates, to name a few-are not in the feature-sets of the software most community platforms use. Drawing on the paradigm of Institutional Analysis and Development, this paper proposes a strategy for addressing this lapse by specifying basic features of a generalizable paradigm for online governance called Modular Politics. Whereas classical governance typologies tend to present a choice among wholesale ideologies, such as democracy or oligarchy, Modular Politics would enable platform operators and their users to build bottom-up governance processes from computational components that are modular and composable, highly versatile in their expressiveness, portable from one context to another, and interoperable across platforms. This kind of approach could implement pre-digital governance systems as well as accelerate innovation in uniquely digital techniques. As diverse communities share and connect their components and data, governance could occur through a ubiquitous network layer. To that end, this paper proposes the development of an open standard for networked governance.},

In this paper, we propose a new technique for reducing the gas usage of smart contracts by changing the underlying data layout. Given a smart contract P and a type-level transformation, our method automatically synthesizes a new contract P′ that is functionally equivalent to P. Our approach provides a convenient DSL for expressing data type refactorings and employs program synthesis to generate the new version of the contract. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Solidare and demonstrate its capabilities on real-world smart contracts from Etherscan and GasStation. In particular, we show that our approach is effective at automating the desired data layout transformation and that it is useful for reducing gas usage of smart contracts that use rich data structures.},

The underlying technology, Blockchain, shifts the responsibility for securing assets to the end-user and requires them to manage their (private) keys. Little attention has been given to how cryptocurrency users handle the challenges of key management in practice and how they select the tools to do so. To close this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=10). Our thematic analysis revealed prominent themes surrounding motivation, risk assessment, and coin management tool usage in practice. We found that the choice of tools is driven by how users assess and balance the key risks that can lead to loss: the risk of (1) human error, (2) betrayal, and (3) malicious attacks. We derive a model, explaining how risk assessment and intended usage drive the decision which tools to use. Our work is complemented by discussing design implications for building systems for the crypto economy.},

abstract = {Many popular websites give users the ability to sign up for their services, which requires personally identifiable information (PII). However, these websites embed third-party tracking and advertising resources, and as a consequence, the authentication flow can intentionally or unintentionally leak PII to these services. Since a user can be identified with PII, trackers can use it for tracking purposes, leading to further privacy leaks when cross-site, cross-browser, and cross-device tracking occur.In this paper, we document a persistent web tracking mechanism that relies on manipulating PII leakage after a user completes the sign-up and sign-in flow (authentication flows) on first-party sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth analysis of leaked PII in the authentication flows. By investigating the authentication flows for 307 popular shopping sites from the Tranco top 10,000 sites, we first discover that 42.3\% of sites leak the PII to third-party services. Then, we present a previously unknown persistent web tracking technique based on PII leakage that enables tracking providers to generate and store a unique persistent identifier for a user with his/her browsing history on their tracking servers. By analyzing 130 first-party senders along with 100 third-party receiver domains, we show that PII leakage is a potentially important vector for online tracking for at least 20 providers. In addition, we check the privacy policy of the 130 first-party senders and observe that they are not clear about PII exchange with third parties. Finally, to provide a wider picture of current in-browser privacy protection techniques, we evaluate the effect of browsers and well-known blocklists against PII leakage. We point out that browsers are unable to deal with PII leakage except for Brave with its privacy-improving features, whereas blocklists reduce the number of leaked PII resources but do not fix this problem in general.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger system that records and verifies transactions across a network of computers and ensures transparency, immutability, and trustworthiness. Smart contracts are programs or protocols embedded into the distributed ledgers and are used to automate agreements between parties of a blockchain. Smart contracts are vulnerable to attacks due to their immutable and public nature, thus, it is important to guarantee the correctness of contracts already at design-time in order to avoid catastrophic events and huge loss of money.In this paper, we investigate the usage of the Abstract State Machine (ASM) formal method for the specification, validation and verification of Ethereum smart contracts. We present the ASM model of the Ethereum virtual machine, and we define a set of ASM libraries that simplify smart contracts modeling. We also provide models of malicious contracts in terms of ASM libraries that can be used to check if a given smart contract is vulnerable to a certain attack. As a proof of concept, we show our approach by exploiting the DAO smart contract and its vulnerability to a reentrancy attack.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology, frequently designated as 'blockchain,' is evolving from its hype phase toward greater maturity and long-term value creation. Although many academic communities were initially slow to grasp the technology's numerous potential implications, meanwhile a substantial amount of research is dedicated to investigating the development and impact of blockchain and related technologies. As undertaken, most research projects take a specific homogenous perspective, such as a technical or business viewpoint. To date, blockchain research studies are largely missing a bridge between and across academic disciplines. Given the manifold implications of blockchain technology, a fruitful crossdisciplinary exchange is therefore needed. In this paper, we bring together researchers with varying expertise to provide a vision into what may be next in terms of concepts, applications, and research agendas. We consider business, economic, societal, legal, technical, and philosophical viewpoints and propose multiple research questions as well as hypotheses arising from these diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, we challenge various academic communities to tackle some of the most crucial issues of current blockchain research and to develop a solid foundation for future exploration.},

Method: Review of state of the art on system architectures for data integration and use of methodologies for elaborating ontologies that represent the knowledge base of the information system. Summary of Results: Implementation of a prototype that allows querying heterogeneous data sources using a vocabulary familiar to the user, removing ambiguities from data with semantics. Contributions and Impact in IS area: The development of a solution for data integration using open source technologies tested with real-world data from a company in the oil and gas sector that can serve as a reference for developing new applied systems to other sectors.},

abstract = {The Daphne giraldii Nitsche gel patch was prepared based on optimal prescription which was obtained by permeation experiments to explore the permeation effect of borneol and azone for active ingredients of Daphne giraldii Nitsche under different proportions. The anti-acute gouty arthritis effect of Daphne giraldii Nitsche gel patch was evaluated on monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced inflammation in rats, an experimental model for acute gouty arthritis. Then the Anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation effect of Daphne giraldii Nitsche gel patch was evaluated by measuring tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interleukin (IL)-1β, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) of rat plasma and rat joint swelling index. Through observing the morphology of the knee and kidney in rats, the anti-acute gouty arthritis effect was further confirmed. The results show that as permeation enhancers, the optimal ratio of borneol to azone is 1:1. The Daphne giraldii Nitsche gel patch can alleviate ankle swelling degree in model rats, significantly reduce the levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and MDA) and raise the activity of SOD. In conclusion, Daphne giraldii Nitsche gel patch has an anti-inflammatory effect on acute gouty arthritis and can protect kidney to some degree through morphology observation.},
