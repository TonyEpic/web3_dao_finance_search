abstract = {Significant achievements have been made for automated allocation of cloud resources. However, the performance of applications may be poor in peak load periods, unless their cloud resources are dynamically adjusted. Moreover, although cloud resources dedicated to different applications are virtually isolated, performance fluctuations do occur because of resource sharing, and software or hardware failures (e.g. unstable virtual machines, power outages, etc.). In this paper, we propose a decentralized economic approach for dynamically adapting the cloud resources of various applications, so as to statistically meet their SLA performance and availability goals in the presence of varying loads or failures. According to our approach, the dynamic economic fitness of a Web service determines whether it is replicated or migrated to another server, or deleted. The economic fitness of a Web service depends on its individual performance constraints, its load, and the utilization of the resources where it resides. Cascading performance objectives are dynamically calculated for individual tasks in the application workflow according to the user requirements. By fully implementing our framework, we experimentally proved that our adaptive approach statistically meets the performance objectives under peak load periods or failures, as opposed to static resource settings.},

abstract = {Significant multidisciplinary efforts combining archaeology and computer science have yielded virtual reconstructions of archaeological sites for visualization. Yet comparatively little attention has been paid to the difficult problem of populating these models, not only to enhance the quality of the visualization, but also to arrive at quantitative computer simulations of the human inhabitants that can help test hypotheses about the possible uses of these sites in ancient times. We introduce an artificial life approach to populating large-scale reconstructions of archaeological sites with virtual humans. Unlike conventional “crowd” models, our comprehensive, detailed models of individual autonomous pedestrians span several modeling levels, including appearance, locomotion, perception, behavior, and cognition. We review our human simulation system and its application to a “modern archaeological” recreation of activity in New York City’s original Pennsylvania Station. We also describe an extension of our system and present its novel application to the visualization of possible human activity in a reconstruction of the Great Temple of ancient Petra in Jordan.},

abstract = {As the number of personal computing and IoT devices grows rapidly, so does the amount of computational power that is available at the edge. Many of these devices are often idle and constitute an untapped resource which could be used for outsourcing computation. Existing solutions for harnessing this power, such as volunteer computing (e.g., BOINC), are centralized platforms in which a single organization or company can control participation and pricing. By contrast, an open market of computational resources, where resource owners and resource users trade directly with each other, could lead to greater participation and more competitive pricing. To provide an open market, we introduce MODiCuM, a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants from misbehaving---which is a key problem in decentralized systems---by resolving disputes via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since it does not require global trust in mediation results. We provide analytical results proving that MODiCuM can deter misbehavior, and we evaluate the overhead of MODiCuM using experimental results based on an implementation of our platform.},

Then, we present a general solution and a proof-of-concept implementation based on the Algorand technology. A preliminary performance evaluation suggest that also in terms of performance we can achieve satisfactory results.

abstract = {Modern industrial landscapes, like Industry 4.0, pose a formidable challenge: how to maintain high-performance levels in dynamic manufacturing environments while minimizing downtime for adaption? Control systems have to be capable of making real-time decisions between adaptation and task fulfillment yet to external, changing production goals. Centralized control systems promise ideal decisions based on global data, but need clean and extensive data. Decentralized multi-agent systems (MAS) instead may decide on local data, yet, the efficiency of decentralized MAS to adapt in dynamic manufacturing settings remains largely unexplored. Thus, we study the potential of a MAS of decentralized agents characterized by adapting exclusively with local information, in addressing the challenges posed by dynamic manufacturing environments. We illustrate the problem using a driverless transportation system for a manufacturing scenario where a control system guides Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in response to unforeseen disturbances and unknown product transportation tasks. We compare the decentralized MAS approach to an omniscient centralized control system, measure the performance of both systems and consider the communication efficiency among the MAS population. We show that decentralized agents with local information can adapt efficiently and shed light on their effectiveness in dynamic environments.},

Though scholarly works on the metaverse have exponentially increased in the past two years, a systematic investigation of the governance issue of the metaverse is still lacking. As an effort to contribute to this line of research, this paper conducts a comprehensive literature review of the pertinent literature on metaverse governance. Specifically, this paper reviews the scholarly insights on the importance of and difficulties in governing the metaverse, recaps researchers’ debate on the governance mode of the metaverse, and discusses five key issues in the metaverse governance, including increased surveillance risks, regulatory and legal issues, data management, ethical concerns, and implications for individuals. Based on insights gained from the literature review, this paper further summarizes the features of extant research on metaverse governance, identifies research gaps, and proposes future research directions.},

abstract = {Improving the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for users of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the key to the widespread promotion and deployment of this technology. Network latency is an important factor affecting users' network experience. Due to the limited processing capacity of a single device node of CPS, the communication relationship between equipment is extremely complicated, and multi-hop device nodes may be passed through in the middle, so designing an efficient routing scheme for CPS is a serious challenge. CPS routing also faces a security crisis. System nodes may send viruses or erroneous results to user equipment, and user equipment may also refuse to pay for routing services to system nodes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a secure routing scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is used to ensure secure transactions between system nodes and user equipment. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is used, and two deep neural networks are used to train intelligent agent to achieve low-latency adaptive traffic scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed autonomous routing technology can reduce the system communication latency by about 31.7\%-45.4\%.},

abstract = {Structural relations established among agents influence the performance of decentralized service discovery process in multiagent systems. Moreover, distributed systems should be able to adapt their structural relations to changes in environmental conditions. In this article, we present a service-oriented multiagent systems, where agents initially self-organize their structural relations based on the similarity of their services. During the service discovery process, agents integrate a mechanism that facilitates the self-organization of their structural relations to adapt the structure of the system to the service demand. This mechanism facilitates the task of decentralized service discovery and improves its performance. Each agent has local knowledge about its direct neighbors and the queries received during discovery processes. With this information, an agent is able to analyze its structural relations and decide when it is more appropriate to modify its direct neighbors and select the most suitable acquaintances to replace them. The experimental evaluation shows how this self-organization mechanism improves the overall performance of the service discovery process in the system when the service demand changes.},

As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

For most of these tasks, robots are designed and programmed by human engineers. While they might not have complete knowledge of the situations/tasks they might come across, the robots operate in environments that are to a large extent predictable. Therefore, it is possible to design bodies with sensors and actuators that seem appropriate and to program controllers that provide some level of adaptive behaviour. But what if one wants to send a robot to operate in an unknown environment whose characteristics are unknown or inaccessible or dangerous for humans? To clean up inside a nuclear reactor, for example, mine for minerals at the bottom of the ocean, or explore an asteroid whose surface is unmapped? If a technology could be produced that could design and fabricate robots in-situ, not only could this avoid wasted effort, it could lead to robots uniquely adapted to their environment.},

abstract = {Organic Computing (OC) and other research initiatives like Autonomic Computing or Proactive Computing have developed the vision of systems possessing life-like properties: they self-organize, adapt to their dynamically changing environments, and establish other so-called self-x properties, like self-healing, self-configuration, self-optimization, etc. What we are searching for in OC are methodologies and concepts for systems that allow to cope with increasingly complex networked application systems by introduction of self-x properties and at the same time guarantee a trustworthy and adaptive response to externally provided system objectives and control actions. Therefore, in OC, we talk about controlled self-organization.Although the terms self-organization and adaptivity have been discussed for years, we miss a clear definition of self-organization in most publications, which have a technically motivated background.In this article, we briefly summarize the state of the art and suggest a characterization of (controlled) self-organization and adaptivity that is motivated by the main objectives of the OC initiative. We present a system classification of robust, adaptable, and adaptive systems and define a degree of autonomy to be able to quantify how autonomously a system is working. The degree of autonomy distinguishes and measures external control that is exerted directly by the user (no autonomy) from internal control of a system which might be fully controlled by an observer/controller architecture that is part of the system (full autonomy). The quantitative degree of autonomy provides the basis for characterizing the notion of controlled self-organization. Furthermore, we discuss several alternatives for the design of organic systems.},

abstract = {How organizations develop and provide their services and software projects is undergoing significant changes and the work methodology applied has agility as its key element when it comes to successfully facing this process for the transformation of traditional business models. This scenario is not foreign to companies dedicated to the development of open-source projects, whose products have experienced a boom over the last decade, leading more and more organizations to include them in their portfolios to improve their IT management, accelerate their digital transformation and boost their businesses. These changes are due to the unique qualities and characteristics of free software, which provide organizations with a wide range of helpful solutions for data analysis, distributed communication, or application deployment. It is essential for these types of companies, which are often supported by communities of developers, to have a culture and values aligned with agility, to prevent the numerous problems that may be caused by the lack of agility concerning the sustainability and transparency of their projects, thereby seriously damaging their competitiveness. This work presents the current state of a doctoral research to support a new open approach that provides solutions and proposals to these organizations and Open-Source communities, providing them with values, principles, guidelines, and agile skills with which to respond to the difficulties and complex dynamics that they face in the agile scaling process.},

abstract = {The Android platform has popularized and caused a widespread adoption of its application development approach based on loosely coupled application components. This loose coupling allows for a flexible composition of applications but also enables invocations and reuse of individual components from third-party applications.One problem with the original Android design is that the rather coarse-grained application components themselves prohibit more fine-grained decomposition. To provide more flexible loosely coupled components and also to foster the reuse of more elementary fine-grained functionality, we suggest the extension of Android application components with our concept of $#956;-agents. Moreover, the organisational aspects of the $#956;-agent model introduce means to structure functionality in a more systematic manner.In this article, we introduce our platform concept called Micro-agents on Android (MOA) that realizes the integration of application development principles with a lightweight notion of agency. Several scenarios are used to describe the benefit from functionality reuse across applications enabled by MOA. A performance evaluation demonstrates that $#956;-agents interact in a more efficient manner than Android services, making them well-suited for fine-grained decomposition.Our approach serves as an example showing how existing technology can benefit from utilizing the modelling advantages of agent-based technologies.},

Progress in these areas has been an incentive and a reason for enhancing distributed systems, Internet of things and mobile collaborative computing. The advances in hardware and software technologies have necessitated the development of new communication standards adapted to devices constrained in resources in all areas, energy, computing power, memory and bandwidth. These communication standards have a crucial role in enhancing the IOT and other architectures of mobile collaborative computing such as Cloud, Fog, Edge, and Mobile Edge Computing. In this paper, we will review the current communication standards and protocols by showing its role in strengthening mobile communication networks in the different architectures of mobile collaborative computing and under the different circumstances. More specifically, we will illustrate, within a new proposed approach, how they can maintain an efficient connection even between mobile devices on the periphery and how they can establish autonomous mobile networks by using peer-to-peer communication via Wi-Fi Direct and other technologies.},

abstract = {Intelligent electricity grids, or 'Smart Grids', are being introduced at a rapid pace. Smart grids allow the management of new distributed power generators such as solar panels and wind turbines, and innovative power consumers such as plug-in hybrid vehicles. One challenge in Smart Grids is to fulfill consumer demands while avoiding infrastructure overloads. Another challenge is to reduce imbalance costs: after ahead scheduling of production and consumption (the socalled 'load schedule'), unpredictable changes in production and consumption yield a cost for repairing this balance.To cope with these risks and costs, we propose a decentralized, multi-agent system solution for coordinated charging of PHEVs in a Smart Grid. Essentially, the MAS utilizes an "intention graph" for expressing the flexibility of a fleet of PHEVs. Based on this flexibility, charging of PHEVs can be rescheduled in real-time to reduce imbalances.We discuss and evaluate two scheduling strategies for reducing imbalance costs: reactive scheduling and proactive scheduling. Simulations show that reactive scheduling is able to reduce imbalance costs by 14\%, while proactive scheduling yields the highest imbalance cost reduction of 44\%.},

abstract = {The evolution of technology is leading to a world where computational systems are made of a huge number of components spread over a logical network: these components operate in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment, joining or leaving the system and creating connections between them at runtime. This scenario poses new challenges to software engineers that have to design and implement such complex systems. We want to address this problem, designing and developing an infrastructure, GRU, that uses self-adaptive decentralized techniques to manage large-scale distributed systems. GRU will help developers to focus on the functional part of their application instead of the needed self-adaptive infrastructure. We aim to evaluate our project with concrete case studies, providing evidence on the validity of our approach, and with the feedback provided by developers that will test our system. We believe this approach can contribute to fill the gap between the theoretical study of self-adaptive systems and their application in a production context.},

Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Decentralized identity (DID), the idea of giving users complete control over their identity-related data, is being used to solve the privacy tension in the identity management of decentralized applications (Dapps). While existing approaches do an excellent job of solving the privacy tension, they have not adequately addressed the accountability and Sybil-resistance issues. Moreover, these approaches have a considerable gas overhead, making them impractical for Dapps. We presented Hades, a novel practical DID system supporting full accountability and fine-grained Sybil-resistance while providing strong privacy properties. Hades supports three aspects of accountability, i.e., auditability, traceability, and revocation. Hades is the first DID system that supports accountability in all these three aspects. Hades is also the first DID system that supports fine-grained Sybil-resistance, enabling Dapps to customize personalized Sybil resistance strategies based on users’ identity attributes. Hades can run efficiently on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We implemented and evaluated Hades. The benchmarks showed that Hades has the lowest gas cost incurred on EVM as far as we know. Also, we presented a case study on attribute-associated fair NFT distribution (“airdrops”) where all previous works failed, whereas we gave a solution leveraging Hades.},

Nevertheless, the phenomenon is relevant to HCI, and signifies important developments for future interactive products. To better understand the NFT phenomenon, and to inform future HCI research and design, we investigated the stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem and relations between them. Based on open data we mined from the social news website Hacker News, we contribute the first data-backed model of stakeholders in the NFT ecosystem. The model reveals a nuanced account of the outlooks of creators, owners, and technologists; identifies investment firms and auction houses as arbiters of knowledge and value; and presents implications for future research.},

abstract = {Human-based evolutionary computation (EC), for which people act as executors of all evolutionary operators, can be used to solve problems in human organizations. We previously developed a human-based EC system that represents solutions as tags (words) and allows people to evaluate solutions by clicking corresponding tags. Although the system was easy and intuitive to use, it could not handle problems for which solutions are represented as long sentences. In addition, the system could not trace the evolution of solutions. Traceability is a must for the system to be widely and reliably used. In this study, we thus develop a human-based EC system that allows solutions to be represented as both sentences and tags. A function for tracing the evolution of solutions is embedded into the system. The function asks a solution creator to specify which existing solutions influenced the solution creation. We conduct an experiment in which 18 human subjects use the system and then fill out a survey. The results show that the system creates better solutions than those created by each human subject independently. Furthermore, the evolution tree generated from the information given by solution creators is used to confirm that the system allows the evolution of solutions to be traced.},

For these applications a key-issue is a well-defined adaptation semantics featuring a cost model which describes the overhead for reconfiguring a component (e.g. when switching between versions).

abstract = {In ubiquitous environments smart devices collaborate although they were never designed specifically for each other. A smart tv acts as a display for a smart phone on demand without installing specific software. However, the variety of collaborations among smart devices is limited. Given a smart home environment, a smart door bell equipped with a camera should easily integrate and utilize its newly provided functionality in collaboration with existing devices like using a smart tv as display. Further it should be able to adapt to environmental changes, e.g., when the user changes the room another device should take over the displaying part. Composing distributed adaptive software systems at run time is a challenging topic in decentralized infrastructures like Smart Cities or Internets of Things. Such infrastructures consist of a large set of independent autonomous subsystems from different providers, but only a few subsystems might be involved in a composition. Centralized self-adaptive approaches maintain a global view on the system which is infeasible for large infrastructures. Decentralized approaches are limited in terms of heterogeneity and lack incorporation of new functionality.},

The second approach defines decentralized specifications wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system.

Although noteworthy successes have been achieved in many fronts, there is a lack of understanding on how to engineer distributed self-adaptive software systems in which central control is not possible. In this paper, we first describe the key attributes of decentralized self-adaptive systems that set them apart from their centralized counterparts. We illustrate these attributes using two case studies on decentralized self-adaptation. The first case study is an instance of a self-healing system dealing with automated traffic management control. The second case study is an instance of a self-optimizing system that improves the quality of service of a decentralized software system through redeployment of its software components. We generalize the lessons learned from our experiences in the form of a reference model. In light of this model, we present numerous challenges that forms the focus of future research in this area.},

To support the planning and control of the YTs, we propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS). We illustrate our approach using a case study at a Dutch logistics service provider. To evaluate the proposed system, we design an agent-based simulation model, which is set up in a similar way as the MAS. We conclude with the verification and validation of the simulation model.},

abstract = {We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks — and, thereby, DeFi protocols — would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.},

We also contribute to the existing research on behavioral programming a method for coordinating behaviorally-programmed components which, due to different time scales or interaction with the external environment, cannot synchronize and thus cannot employ event blocking. We show that the resulting decentralized system retains many of the advantages present in a purely behavioral, fully synchronized system.},

The crowd can contribute with collecting data in the field, completing map information or votes for ideas or products. Even though the participation of large numbers of users with heterogeneous devices in crowdsourcing is a highly recurrent task, generic infrastructures for crowdsourcing can be hardly found. Especially the management of users, mobile devices and contributed data has to be repetitively implemented in new projects. To ease the development of crowdsourcing applications, in this paper we propose a generic platform for crowdsourcing supporting diverse crowdsourcing scenarios, the ability to handle large numbers of users and the involvement of heterogeneous mobile devices. The evaluation is based on scalability and performance experiments in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract = {Securing digital communications is a major preoccupation for industry and academia, and a great number of techniques have been successfully developed to achieve that goal. The predominant model for digital communication is that which relies on trusted third-parties, either as local servers or as cloud services. Meanwhile, emerging technologies such as internet-of-things are set to broadcast growing amounts of potentially sensitive information thereby making centralized architectures problematic for privacy and performance reasons and making decentralized networks ever more relevant. However, these third-parties play an important role in securing brokered communications and are essential in providing Authentication and Non-Repudiation according to current models. Clearly, such an approach cannot be used in peer-to-peer networks and there is need for a simple model applicable in fully decentralized networks to provide Non-Repudiation. This document proposes such a model, presents an implementation and discusses its application, particularly pertaining to implementing irrefutable trustless transaction mechanisms -- similar to blockchain -- in the realm of limited resources.},

As a research methodology there is a field study based on a survey applied to 45 employees (bosses and IT workers) who work in 22 public institutions located in the province of Manab\'{\i}, Republic of Ecuador, in this study they identify aspects such as: a) the professional profile of the personnel that works in this areas, b) the standards that apply to government, demand management and IT service management, c) levels of implementation of the IT services catalogue. The conclusion that stands out most is, that most institutions do not have their IT services catalog implemented: for the limited application of regulations and/or appropriate standards for the government, the management of services and the management of IT demand, among other important aspects.},

abstract = {Centralized online social networks --- e.g., Facebook, Twitter and TikTok --- help drive social connection on the Internet, but have nigh unfettered access to monitor and monetize the personal data of their users. This centralization can especially undermine the use of the social internet by minority populations, who disproportionately bear the costs of institutional surveillance. We introduce a new class of privacy-enhancing technology --- decentralized privacy overlays (DePOs) --- that helps cOSN users regain some control over their personal data by allowing them to selectively share secret content on cOSNs through decentralized content distribution networks. As a first step, we present an implementation and user evaluation of Image DePO, a proof-of-concept design probe that allows users to upload and share secret photos on Facebook through the Interplanetary File System peer-to-peer protocol. We qualitatively evaluated Image DePO in a controlled, test environment with 19 queer and Black, Indigenous, (and) Person of Color (BIPOC) participants. We found that while Image DePO could help address the institutional threats with which our participants expressed concern, interpersonal threats were the more salient concern in their decisions to share content. Accordingly, we argue that in order to see widespread use, DePOs must align protection against abstract institutional threats with protection against the more salient interpersonal threats users consider when making specific sharing decisions.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed rapid adoption of low-power Wireless Sensor-Actuator Networks (WSANs) in process industries. To meet the critical demand for reliable and real-time communication in harsh industrial environments, the industrial WSAN standards make a set of specific design choices, such as employing the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) technique. Such design choices distinguish industrial WSANs from traditional Wireless Sensor Networks, which were designed for best-effort services. Recently, there has been increasing interest in developing new methods to enable autonomous transmission scheduling for industrial WSANs that run TSCH and the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). Our study shows that the current approaches fail to consider the traffic loads of different devices when assigning time slots and channels, which significantly compromises network performance when facing high data rates. In this article, we introduce a novel Autonomous Traffic-Aware transmission scheduling method for industrial WSANs. The device that runs ATRIA can detect its traffic load based on its local routing information and then schedule its transmissions accordingly without the need to exchange information with neighboring devices. Experimental results show that ATRIA provides significantly higher end-to-end network reliability and lower end-to-end latency without introducing additional overhead compared with a state-of-the-art baseline.},

abstract = {This paper develops a fully decentralized control architecture to address the workload consolidation problem in large-scale server clusters wherein the cluster's processing capacity is dynamically tuned to satisfy the service level agreements (SLAs) associated with the incoming workload while consolidating the workload onto the fewest number of servers. In a decentralized setting, this problem is decomposed into simpler subproblems, each of which is mapped to a server and solved by a controller assigned to that server. Though control loops on different servers run independently of each other, they are implicitly coupled via the shared high-level performance goal and interactions between controllers may result in undesired system behavior such as SLA violations and frequent switching of cores on and off. Using the proposed architecture as the reference, we analyze how the organization of individual controllers within the control structure affects its overall performance for large clusters of up to thousand servers. Our studies indicate that the control structure, when organized as a causal system in which a precedence relation exists among the individual controllers, achieves a high degree of SLA satisfaction (&gt; 98\%) while significantly reducing the corresponding switching cost.},
