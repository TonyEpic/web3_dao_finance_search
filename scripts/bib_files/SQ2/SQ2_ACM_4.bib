abstract = {The rise of social media enables access to valuable information but also fuels the spread of fake news and misinformation. Cheapfake is a type of misinformation created through simple techniques, often involving the use of unaltered images with misleading captions. To distinguish between Out-of-Context (OOC) and Not-Out-of-Context (NOOC) image-caption pairs, prior research has used text-to-image generative models to generate images from captions and then extract correlations between the generated images and the original images. Despite being unable to identify contradictions in the caption pairs, the aforementioned work has demonstrated promising potential for using generative models in cheapfake detection. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that leverages a generative model to join the contents of an original image and a caption into a new image, referred to as a context-synthetic image. To convert the quantitative difference between an original image and a context-synthetic image, termed as the contextual deviation value, into OOC and NOOC labels, we train a classification model on a newly curated dataset of 7144 context-synthetic images generated using the Stable Diffusion model. We believe that our work offers valuable insights into the use of generative models for cheapfake detection, paving the way for future advancements in this field.},

abstract = {In the past years, since 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has alarmed the world with the speed and its spread around the world. This raised the demand of early, accurate and automated detection system for the COVID-19 as there is a scarcity of manpower in medical field. This attracted many researches using deep learning to build COVID-19 detection model. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, computed tomography scanning are being used as more accurate, non-invasive and efficient method in real-time. In this work, we have proposed a model using six different image classification techniques of deep learning on CT scan images and compared the accuracy to find the most suitable and reliable model for transfer learning to achieve best result on ResNet50 as 97.19\% training and 98.05\% testing accuracy. The model will automate the process of detection of the COVID-19, leading to the advancement in the field of smart health-care.},

abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has spread and seriously affected the whole world since its first appearance in 2019. In early 2021, after two successful anti-epidemic attempts, Covid-19 broke out again with the relatively big number of Coronavirus infected cases in the community in Vietnam. When the government decided to apply social distancing, Vietnamese Ministry of Education immediately allowed pupils and students to be off school and conduct synchronous e-learning at home. The implementation of this form of Synchronous e-learning this time is not new to both learners and lecturers as well as universities. However, it cannot be said that the form of Synchronous e-learning in Vietnam has been well built or met the needs of learners. There are still a few limitations when the adaptation is temporary in the context of the pandemic. Without major changes in methods and programs, the teaching of skill subjects through the Synchronous e-learning has to face challanges. This causes the students to find it very difficult to learn the subjects and the learning results seem to be not high. The authors choose to study these difficulties to give solutions to the problems.},

abstract = {Evolutionary multitask algorithms that adopt multitask optimization paradigms have been proposed to tackle multiple problems simultaneously and improve the performance of traditional evolutionary algorithms. One of the most crucial challenges in evolutionary multitasking applied to network design is the lack of an efficient unified representation to encode solutions. This paper presents the first representation based on node-depth encoding for evolutionary multitask algorithms to tackle network design problems. Remarkably, we propose an encoding method to represent solutions modeled by trees of arbitrary graphs in the form of a unified representation and design a corresponding decoding method to reconstruct solutions from a unified search space for each task. To verify the efficiency of our proposed methods, extensive experiments are conducted on well-known network design problems and demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than previous approaches regarding solution quality.},

In recent approaches for mitigation and adaptation, data analytics and ML are only one part of the solution that requires interdisciplinary and methodological research and innovations. For example, challenges include multi-modal and multi-source data fusion to combine satellite imagery with other relevant data, handling noisy and missing ground data at various spatio-temporal scales, and ensembling multiple physical and ML models to improve prediction accuracy. Despite recognized successes, there are many areas where ML is not applicable, performs poorly or gives insights that are not actionable. This tutorial will survey the recent and significant contributions in KDD and ML for sustainable development and will highlight current challenges that need to be addressed to transform and equip engaged sustainability science with robust ML-based tools to support actionable decision-making for a more sustainable future.},

In its fight against the pandemic, Vietnam has chosen to implement social distancing and let students study online at home to prevent the spread of the virus. However, the implementation of online learning is conducted when universities haven't fully prepared the conditions, thus causing many difficulties during the process. These challenges seem to be more severe for public universities where the financial and administrative dependence on the government is relatively large. The implementation of online teaching and learning in response to the pandemic has directly affected students' attitudes and learning efficiency. For this reason, the authors have conducted a survey on students' satisfaction with Synchronous E-learning at public universities in Vietnam.

abstract = {We applied a Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Synchronization Constraints. Additionally, both vehicles and clients are skilled, and each client can require up to two distinct skills to be serviced. On double-skilled clients, the operations of each skill should be performed by different vehicles, either simultaneously or respecting a precedence order. Those requirements introduce nonlinearities on the problem, in the sense that a small change on a single route potentially impacts all the other routes of the solution, making it hard to define an effective local search procedure. To circumvent this difficulty, we approached the problem using a genetic algorithm that evolves the sequence in which the services are inserted into the routes. We assessed the performance of our solution method using instances from the literature of the home health care problem. The genetic algorithm outperformed the previous best-known solutions found by a fix-and-optimize matheuristic by up to 25\%, using less than half of computational times reported previously. The BRKGA demonstrated to be able to perform well both in exploration and exploitation in the solution space of the problem.},

abstract = {Identifying and segmenting lesions are challenging tasks in automatic analysis of endoscopic images in computer aided diagnosis systems. Models based on encoder-decoder architectures have been proposed to segment lesions with promising results. However, those approaches have limitations in modeling the local appearance, dealing with imbalanced data, and over-fitting. This paper proposes a novel method to address these limitations. We propose to improve a state-of-the-art encoder-decoder based model for image segmentation, named as Focal-Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)-Intersection over Union (IoU) loss for Feature Pyramid Network (FocalFPNet), by introducing a new loss function for training. The novel loss function is called Focal-BCE-IoU (FBI), consisting three terms, a Focal term, a BCE term, and an IoU term. In addition, we employ the Lasso regularization sparsity technique in learning to reduce over-fitting. As a result, our proposed model effectively segments lesions of various sizes and shapes, thereby improving the accuracy of the lesion segmentation task. Specifically, the Dice scores of the proposed model on the Esophageal cancer and the Peptic ulcer are 86.54\% and 70.05\%, respectively.},

abstract = {With advancements in distributed ledger technologies and smart contracts, tokenized voting rights gained prominence within decentralized finance (DeFi). Voting rights tokens (a.k.a. governance tokens) are fungible tokens that grant individual holders the right to vote upon the fate of a project. The motivation behind these tokens is to achieve decentral control within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Because the initial allocations of these tokens is often undemocratic, the DeFi project and DAO of Yearn Finance experimented with a fair launch allocation where no tokens are pre-mined and all participants have an equal opportunity to receive them. Regardless, research on voting rights tokens highlights the formation of timocracies over time. The consideration is that the tokens’ tradability is the cause of concentration. To examine this proposition, this article uses an agent-based model to simulate and analyze the concentration of voting rights tokens post three fair launch allocation scenarios under different trading modalities. The results show that regardless of the allocation, concentration persistently occurs. It confirms the consideration that the ‘disease’ is endogenous: the cause of concentration is the tokens’ tradability. The findings inform theoretical understandings and practical implications for on-chain governance mediated by tokens.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that operate on the blockchain, which is the technology that offers security and decentralization. The principal characteristic of cryptocurrencies is that they are not generally issued by a central authority. Many factors can influence the volatility of prices. This paper enables to drive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis of Tweets, Google news and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of cryptocurrency price prediction. Most of the studies have focused exclusively on the sentiment analysis of tweets. In this work, we propose the use of common machine learning tools and available Google News data for predicting the price of crypto. We present the results of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model using Tweets and Google News data.},

The idea of this paper is to use text-to-speech and speech-driven-face to automatically create a video lecture with the instructor's voice and face without recording the video. This approach not only gives the best display of lesson content of video lectures which contains slides (pdf format), instructor's voice, and face but also enables the modification of video lectures without recapture video. Furthermore, this approach allows learners to choose a video lecture with their desired instructor's voice and face. The experimental results validated our approach.},

abstract = {In recent years, when the world economic activity was affected by the epidemic, it was very active in the virtual world. Since Facebook announced the development of the Metaverse, its related applications and services have instantly become hot issues. Although it may take a few years for the Metaverse to become popular as a social platform today, its impact on future community development will be significant. On the other hand, since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs, and the issue of decentralization has gradually spread. Today, as the application of smart contracts becomes more and more extensive and innovative, such as the decentralized architecture and applications of NFT, DeFi, GameFi, DApp, DAO, DEX, its influence has gradually expanded from the virtual world to physical applications, and also has impacts on real financial applications. The recent burst of NFT and DeFi addressed this issue. There are some gaps between reality and hype, and it is a lesson just like e-commerce burst some 20 years ago. A well format regulation and supervision seem required. However, the challenge for financial supervision today is the decentralized application and anonymity. This paper discusses the innovations in communities that related to decentralized financial services in the blockchain. And the blockchain financial supervision issues that within the tolerable range of risk and impact to both virtual and real world.},

It provides the insights for not only the explicit learning indicators but also the implicit attributes of learners, based on which further potential learning support can be timely provided in both physical and cyber world accordingly. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the existing studies for examining the empirical evidences on the usage of IoT data in education and the capabilities of multimodal analysis to provide useful insights for smarter education. In particular, we classify the multimodal data into four categories based on the data sources (data from digital, physical, physiological and environmental spaces). Moreover, we propose a concept framework for better understanding the current state of the filed and summarize the insights into six main themes (learner behavior understanding, learner affection computing, smart learning environment, learning performance prediction, group collaboration modeling and intelligent feedback) based on the objectives for intelligent learning. The associations between different combinations of data modalities and various learning indicators are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges and future directions are also presented from three aspects.},

However, because of their complexity, a N\^{o}m script can be transliterated into one or more of the Vietnamese national scripts (polyphonic), which makes transliteration difficult. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce this complexity by grouping similar words in the statistical machine translation process. Especially, we use class-based language models to enhance higher-level abstract information, making the transliteration model better solve the polyphonic. Our experiments give an improvement of +0.39 BLEU compared to the baseline model, proving the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We aim to address a practical challenge to maximize the perceived quality of end users while keeping the delay constraints remained satisfied using RSMA.

However, not much is known about how these settings influence use, nor how to design for them. We analyse 233 YouTube videos of VR Fails to: (1) understand when breakdowns occur, and (2) reveal how the seams between VR use and the social and physical setting emerge. The videos show a variety of fails, including users flailing, colliding with surroundings, and hitting spectators. They also suggest causes of the fails, including fear, sensorimotor mismatches, and spectator participation. We use the videos as inspiration to generate design ideas. For example, we discuss more flexible boundaries between the real and virtual world, ways of involving spectators, and interaction designs to help overcome fear. Based on the findings, we further discuss the ‘moment of breakdown’ as an opportunity for designing engaging and enhanced VR experiences.},

abstract = {The software running in embedded or cyber-physical systems is typically of proprietary nature, so users do not know precisely what the systems they own are (in)capable of doing. Most malfunctionings of such systems are not intended by the manufacturer, but some are, which means these cannot be classified as bugs or security loopholes. The most prominent examples have become public in the diesel emissions scandal, where millions of cars were found to be equipped with software violating the law, altogether polluting the environment and putting human health at risk. The behaviour of the software embedded in these cars was intended by the manufacturer, but it was not in the interest of society, a phenomenon that has been called software doping. Due to the unavailability of a specification, the analysis of doped software is significantly different from that for buggy or insecure software and hence classical verification and testing techniques have to be adapted.The work presented in this article builds on existing definitions of software doping and lays the theoretical foundations for conducting software doping tests, so as to enable uncovering unethical manufacturers. The complex nature of software doping makes it very hard to effectuate doping tests in practice. We explain the main challenges and provide efficient solutions to realise doping tests despite this complexity.},

Therefore, when it comes to privacy and security, clear communication is essential to avoid putting users’ personal data at risk. In this paper, we elicit 32 symbols and metaphors associated with privacy and security through two brainstorming sessions (n = 8, each). Six experts further separated this collection into security and privacy-related symbols and generated clusters based on similarity. Using participants’ clusters, we derived underlying themes. As a result, we present a symbol and metaphor space for privacy and security and discuss their perceived meaning. Our findings can serve researchers, designers, and developers to find suitable symbols or metaphors for a given scenario (e.g., to decide on the interaction metaphor for a tangible security mechanism) and to understand if a symbol is ambiguous or how it may be understood (e.g., is an eye associated with privacy configurations?).

abstract = {Live video streaming services have experienced significant growth since the emergence of social networking paradigms in recent years. In this scenario, adaptive bitrate streaming communications transmitted on web protocols provide a convenient and cost-efficient facility to serve various multimedia platforms over the Internet. In these communication models, video content is delivered optimally, possibly transcoded, edited automatically, and cached temporarily by network elements along the path. To this end, the computational capabilities of various network elements are considered as major resources to be optimized for service quality improvements. This article provides a contemporary survey of cutting-edge live video streaming studies from a computation-driven perspective. First, an overview of the global standards, system architectures, and streaming protocols is presented. Next, hierarchical computation-driven models of live video streaming are anatomized, including cloud-, edge-, and peer-to-peer-based solutions. Cutting-edge studies are then reviewed to discover the advances they have made in improving system performance in multiple areas. Finally, open challenges are presented to direct future research in this field.},

A wide range of evolutionary strategies such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Differential Evolution along with their quantum-inspired versions, are evaluated. The black-box attacks are shown to be highly effective against state-of-the-art forensics, exposing a vulnerability in current defense techniques. Analysis of the performance of different evolutionary strategies used for attacking also reveals insights on possible solutions to counter against the attacks.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has become a crucial technology for multimedia computing. It offers a powerful instrument to automatically produce high-level abstractions of complex multimedia data, which can be exploited in a number of applications, including object detection and recognition, speech-to- text, media retrieval, multimodal data analysis, and so on. The availability of affordable large-scale parallel processing architectures, and the sharing of effective open-source codes implementing the basic learning algorithms, caused a rapid diffusion of DL methodologies, bringing a number of new technologies and applications that outperform, in most cases, traditional machine learning technologies. In recent years, the possibility of implementing DL technologies on mobile devices has attracted significant attention. Thanks to this technology, portable devices may become smart objects capable of learning and acting. The path toward these exciting future scenarios, however, entangles a number of important research challenges. DL architectures and algorithms are hardly adapted to the storage and computation resources of a mobile device. Therefore, there is a need for new generations of mobile processors and chipsets, small footprint learning and inference algorithms, new models of collaborative and distributed processing, and a number of other fundamental building blocks. This survey reports the state of the art in this exciting research area, looking back to the evolution of neural networks, and arriving to the most recent results in terms of methodologies, technologies, and applications for mobile environments.},

abstract = {Recently, the spy cameras spotted in private rental places have raised immense privacy concerns. The existing solutions for detecting them require additional support from synchronous external sensing or stimulus hardware such as on/off LED circuits, which require extra obligations from the user. For example, a user needs to carry a smartphone and laboriously perform preset motions (e.g., jumping, waving, and preplanned walking pattern) for synchronous sensing of acceleration signals. These requirements cause considerable discomfort to the user and limit the practicability of prevalent solutions. To cope with this, we propose CSI:DeSpy, an efficient and painless method by leveraging video bitrate fluctuations of the WiFi camera and the passively obtained Channel States Information (CSI) from user motion. CSI:DeSpy includes a self-adaptive feature that makes it robust to detect motion efficiently in multipath-rich environments. We implemented CSI:DeSpy on the Android platform and assessed its performance in diverse real-life scenarios, namely; (1) its reliability with the intensities of physical activities in diverse multipath-rich environments, (2) its practicability with activities of daily living, (3) its unobtrusiveness with passive sensing, and (4) its robustness to different network loads. CSI:DeSpy attained average detection rates of 96.6\%, 96.2\%, 98.5\%, and 93.6\% respectively.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Web Applications (WAs) are complex software systems, used by multiple users with different roles and often developed to support and manage business processes. Due to the changing nature of the supported processes, WAs need to be easily and quickly modified, to adapt and align them to the processes they support. In recent years, Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approaches have been proposed and used to develop and evolve WAs. However, the definition of appropriate MDE approaches for the development of flexible process-centric WAs is still limited. In particular, (flexible) workflow models have never been integrated with the models (e.g., presentation, information models) used in MDE approaches to develop this type of applications. In this paper, we present M3D (Model Driven Development with Declare), a tool for developing WAs that integrates three MDE metamodels used to represent the main components of a WA with the metamodel of Declare, a declarative language to model business processes. The tool exploits and combines the declarative nature of Declare and the advantages of MDE to get an efficient roundtrip engineering support to develop and evolve flexible process-centric WAs.},

Besides, assessing students using new learning methodologies, which avoid the idea of teachers as the center of knowledge and students as secondary actors, allow us to understand their advantages and disadvantages. Challenge Based Learning (CBL) is one of these proposals, created with the essential principles of which skills are expected to the 21st century. This paper presents an experience applying an assessment approach during one year to a multidisciplinary group of students, who learned how to develop mobile applications using CBL and came from different universities and courses. The main focus is to allow those students to learn to self-assess them, understand their learning progress on ten technical topics, and share learned lessons from that experience.},

The cross-modal retrieval system uses a textual query to look for images; the air quality index can be predicted using lifelogging images; the congestion can be predicted using weather and tweets data; daily exercises and meals can help to predict the sleeping quality are some examples of this research direction. Although vast investigations focusing on multimodal data analytics have been developed, few cross-data (e.g., cross-modal data, cross-domain, cross-platform) research has been carried on. In order to promote intelligent cross-data analytics and retrieval research and to bring a smart, sustainable society to human beings, the specific article collection on "Intelligent Cross-Data Analysis and Retrieval" is introduced. This Research Topic welcomes those who come from diverse research domains and disciplines such as well-being, disaster prevention and mitigation, mobility, climate change, tourism, healthcare, and food computing},

abstract = {Widely used Deep Learning (DL) frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet, heavily rely on the NVIDIA cuDNN for performance. However, using cuDNN does not always give the best performance. One reason is that it is hard to handle every case of versatile DNN models and GPU architectures with a library that has a fixed implementation. Another reason is that cuDNN lacks kernel fusion functionality that gives a lot of chances to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a DL optimization framework for versatile GPU workloads, called DeepCuts. It considers both kernel implementation parameters and GPU architectures. It analyzes the DL workload, groups multiple DL operations into a single GPU kernel, and generates optimized GPU kernels considering kernel implementation parameters and GPU architecture parameters. The evaluation result with various DL workloads for inference and training indicates that DeepCuts outperforms cuDNN/cuBLAS-based implementations and the state-of-the-art DL optimization frameworks, such as TVM, TensorFlow XLA, and TensorRT.},

abstract = {Microservice architectures are composed of a set of independent microservices that execute well-defined functionalities, allowing each one to be developed in different programming languages and data management technologies. The problem, however, is that such heterogeneity implies in a harder verification process of communication among microservices and the architectural designs of each microservice. Although the state-of-the-art provides several architectural conformance solutions, none formally restricts communications (e.g., over HTTP) between different systems. Even stable and industrial solutions---such as Kubernetes, Terraform, and Docker Compose---provide basic mechanisms to restrict communications between microservices. Thereupon, this paper proposes and evaluates a multi-platform architectural conformance solution for the microservice architecture. For this purpose, (i) we specify an architectural constraint language, called DCL+---adapted from the DCL (Dependency Constraint Language) language; (ii) we propose a multi-platform process that restricts the communication between the microservices and also verifies the architectural projects of each one of them; (iii) we develop DCL+check, a tool that implements the proposed solution; (iv) we apply our process in a medium-size real-world application composed of eleven microservices, developed in two different languages (JavaScript and Java). As result, we found 16 communication and 171 structural design violations. The communication violations occurred in general due to the lack of knowledge of the developers about the restrictions of communication among the modules of the orchestrator system and other microservices, as well as the evolution of two microservices.},

abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis is a common infectious disease primarily targeting the lungs and of high morality and prevalence. Efficient prediction of tuberculosis is important to counter epidemics and successfully allocate recourse. This study's main objective is to investigate the effectiveness of using web search queries in predicting the incidence of tuberculosis in China. We conduct a comprehensive comparison on data driven methods for predicting the incidence of tuberculosis.Methods: Several data mining models are implemented in our study, including stepwise linear regression and SVM incorporating Baidu index (a recording of search queries on Baidu, the main search engine in China). The two methods are compared with traditional time series methods of autoregressive integrated moving (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA). In addition, to further investigate the reliability of prediction, the effectiveness of integrating the individual models is explored in our study, a hybrid model of SARIMA and SVM and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) are adopted to maximize the predictive utility of the models.Results and Conclusion: The experiment results show that Internet queries provide effective data sources for predicting tuberculosis, with comparable predicting ability to that of traditional time series models. It also shows that combining two or models using BMA or hybrid models can improve the prediction ability, with BMA showing by far the best results in prediction in terms of both MAPE and RSME in the 5 areas studied (Guangdong, Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai). The findings from this study pave the way for developing accurate and timely prediction of tuberculosis cases, which is important for allocating healthcare recourses and developing strategies to counter possible future outbreaks in real practice.},

address = {Fukushima-ken, JPN},
abstract = {Pattern based design is an effective way to avoid an expensive process of reinventing, rediscovering and revalidating agnostic software artifacts. The Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) leverages the reusability factor of an application by applying decoupling and location transparency in the communication of the disparate applications and services. Design patterns are reusable solutions to solve recurring issues pertaining to the Functional, Non-Functional and Implementation tasks. The e-Learning is an ever growing and expanding arena. It has huge number of disparate applications and services that can be exposed over a ubiquitous media, such as the Internet, to the various kinds of end users. Therefore, the EAI is an important aspect in the e-Learning Arena in order to increase the high reusability and application decoupling factors. In this paper, we are imitating the ModelView-Controller (MVC) design patterns in order to explore the other composite patterns for an efficient integration of the applications and services. The demarcation of a Functional (View) and an Implementation (Model) task can be achieved deliberately by inducing an Integrator (Controller). The Controller can be further enriched to encapsulate certain Non-Functional activities such as security, reliability, scalability, and routing of request. This enables the separation of an Integration Logic from that of a Functional Logic (Client Application) and an Implementation Logic (Service). The Controller can be viewed by using the compound design pattern of the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). This paper discusses how the Dependency Injection pattern is used in the ESB pattern for the integration of the e-Learning applications.},

In this paper, new Arcsine Shewhart Sign and Variable Sampling Interval EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) distribution-free control charts are proposed. The procedure does not require the assumption of normal data. A Markov chain method is used to obtain optimal designs and evaluate the statistical performance of the proposed charts. Furthermore, practical guidelines and comparisons with the basic Arcsine EWMA Sign control chart are provided. Results show that the proposed chart is considerably more efficient than the basic Arcsine EWMA Sign control chart. The proposed control charts are illustrated by analysing the service quality of the Vancouver City Call Centre.},

Online teaching and learning was then temporarily adopted to ensure students’ continuous learning. However, the effectiveness of this method was far from expectation. Students showed their reluctance to engage in the virtual learning environment. In the meantime, they shared their negative feedback on the traditional teaching and learning method. As a result, lecturers desired to have a more effective approach conducted after the pandemic. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the feasibility of blended learning implementation at some public universities in Vietnam.

For this, we conducted an online survey (N = 444) where we captured participants’ preferences of eight established tangible privacy mechanisms well-known in daily life, their perceptions of effective privacy protection, and personal attributes. We found that the attributes that correlated most strongly with participants’ perceptions of the established tangible privacy mechanisms were their “need for touch” and previous experiences with the mechanisms. We use our findings to identify desirable characteristics of tangible mechanisms to better inform future tangible, digital, and mixed privacy protections. We also show which individuals benefit most from tangibles, ultimately motivating a more individual and effective approach to privacy protection in the future.},

The technical challenge is to compensate the projected image with the intended position and size during walking. To verify the concept, we developed a self-gait training assistance system that displays stride length information on the floor while the user is walking. We conducted a study with ten healthy older adults (ages: 76-91). The results show the effectiveness of visual clues in controlling stride length and elderly people's acceptance of the wearable projector device.},

abstract = {Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in real-time needs to be done quickly and accurately. During an endoscopic examination, the technical doctor must spend a lot of time classifying anatomical landmarks before proceeding with further work such as lesion detection or abnormal region segmentation. The endoscopist also can ensure the completion of the examination with the help of the anatomical landmarks. In this study, we develop a robust and high-performance neural network classifying ten anatomical landmarks in the Upper Gastrointestinal tract. To this end, the proposed method consists of a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to learn an efficient (dis)similarity metric of a pair of landmarks. We then propose to use the weight that is learned by SNN to a CNN-based structure for the feature extraction. The proposed CNN-based architecture is a lightweight model of Resnet-18 that is designed to achieve the best performance as well as a low cost of computational time. Finally, we utilize an SVM classifier to automatically classify ten anatomical landmarks from the Upper Gastrointestinal endoscopic images. The dataset used in this study is collected in four lighting modes such as (WLI) White-light Imaging, FICE (Flexible spectral imaging color enhancement), BLI (Blue Light Imaging), and LCI (Linked color imaging). The dataset is labeled by endoscopists with more than five years of experience. To enrich the dataset, we also research and evaluate augmentation techniques as effectively as possible. The augmented data includes a combination of the geometrical transforms and the data generated using CycleGAN deep learning networks. The proposed method works well with four lighting modes without depending on a certain lighting mode. It achieved 96.3\% sensitivity, 99.6\% specificity, and 99.3\% accuracy. As a result of the computational time, we achieved approximately 60 FPS (Frame Per Second) using 20W average power with the deep learning framework Pytorch on the Jetson Xavier AGX.},

Because of high requirements on a single processing machine, real-time visualizations from multiple users are unfeasible if rendered locally. We designed a framework that collects data from multiple eye-trackers regardless of their physical location, analyses these streams, and renders heatmaps in real-time. We propose a cloud computing architecture (EyeCloud) consisting of master and slave nodes on a cloud cluster, and a web interface for fast computation and effective aggregation of the large volumes of eye-tracking data. In experimental studies of the feasibility and effectiveness, we built a cloud cluster on a well-known service, implemented the architecture and reported on a comparison between the proposed system and traditional local processing. The results showed efficiency of the EyeCloud when recordings vary in durations. To our knowledge, this is the first solution to implement cloud computing for gaze visualization.},

The physical design optimizations commonly improve area, latency (=speed), and power consumption together. This paper is dedicated to improving the physical implementation of FPGA tiles and the configuration storage in SRAM FPGAs. This paper proposes to remap configuration bits and interface wires to implement tightly packed tiles. Using the FABulous FPGA framework, we show that our optimizations are virtually for free but can save over 20\% in area and improve latency at the same time. We will evaluate our approach in different scenarios by changing the available metal layers or the requested channel capacity. Our optimizations consider all tiles and we propose a flow that resolves dependencies between the CLBs and other tiles. Moreover, we will show that frame-based reconfiguration is, in almost all cases, better than shift register configuration.},

abstract = {This paper is about the development of MLEA, a platform that assists, through Android cellphones and tablets, the mobility of users of learning virtual environments. MLEA is an application that implements computational techniques such as web services, design patterns, ontologies, and mobile computational techniques in order to allow the communication between mobile devices and the content management system -- Moodle. It's based on a service oriented, client server architecture that combines the REST protocol and JSON format for data interchange. The client will be provided with features for alerts, file downloads, chats and forums, grade books, quizzes, and calendar, among others.},

abstract = {Entity-centric knowledge graphs (KGs) are now popular to collect facts about entities. KGs have rich schemas with a large number of different types and predicates to describe the entities and their relationships. On these rich schemas, logical rules are used to represent dependencies between the data elements. While rules are useful in query answering, data curation, and other tasks, they usually do not come with the KGs. Such rules have to be manually defined or discovered with the help of rule mining methods. We believe this rule-collection task should be done collectively to better capitalize our understanding of the data and to avoid redundant work conducted on the same KGs. For this reason, we introduce RuleHub, our extensible corpus of rules for public KGs. RuleHub provides functionalities for the archival and the retrieval of rules to all users, with an extensible architecture that does not constrain the KG or the type of rules supported. We are populating the corpus with thousands of rules from the most popular KGs and report on our experiments on automatically characterizing the quality of a rule with statistical measures.},
