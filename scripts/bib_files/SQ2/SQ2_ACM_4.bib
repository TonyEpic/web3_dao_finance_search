abstract = {The Weighted-Mean Subsequence Reduced (W-MSR) algorithm, the state-of-the-art method for Byzantine-resilient design of decentralized multi-robot systems, is based on discarding outliers received over Linear Consensus Protocol (LCP). Although W-MSR provides theoretical guarantees relating network connectivity to the convergence of the underlying consensus, W-MSR comes with several limitations: the number of Byzantine robots, F, to tolerate should be known a priori, each robot needs to maintain 2F+1 neighbors, F+1 robots must independently make local measurements of the consensus property in order for the swarm's decision to change, and W-MSR is specific to LCP and does not generalize to applications not implemented over LCP. In this work, we propose a Decentralized Blocklist Protocol (DBP) based on inter-robot accusations. Accusations are made on the basis of locally-made observations of misbehavior, and once shared by cooperative robots across the network are used as input to a graph matching algorithm that computes a blocklist. DBP generalizes to applications not implemented via LCP, is adaptive to the number of Byzantine robots, and allows for fast information propagation through the multi-robot system while simultaneously reducing the required network connectivity relative to W-MSR. On LCP-type applications, DBP reduces the worst-case connectivity requirement of W-MSR from (2F+1)-connected to (F+1)-connected and the minimum number of cooperative observers required to propagate new information from F+1 to just 1 observer. We demonstrate that our approach to Byzantine resilience scales to hundreds of robots on target tracking, time synchronization, and localization case studies.},

abstract = {When solving a complex task, humans will spontaneously form teams and to complete different parts of the whole task, respectively. Meanwhile, the cooperation between teammates will improve efficiency. However, for current cooperative MARL methods, the cooperation team is constructed through either heuristics or end-to-end blackbox optimization. In order to improve the efficiency of cooperation and exploration, we propose a structured diversification emergence MARL framework named Rochico based on reinforced organization control and hierarchical consensus learning. Rochico first learns an adaptive grouping policy through the organization control module, which is established by independent multi-agent reinforcement learning. Further, the hierarchical consensus module based on the hierarchical intentions with consensus constraint is introduced after team formation. Simultaneously, utilizing the hierarchical consensus module and a self-supervised intrinsic reward enhanced decision module, the proposed cooperative MARL algorithm Rochico can output the final diversified multi-agent cooperative policy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a disruptive approach "Immersive Networking" enabling massively distributed IoT nodes to participate in autonomous and cooperative decision-making. The approach is mandated by perceived limitations in 5G networking architecture maintaining control in the edge gateway. In our approach, control may be delegated to clusters of IoT nodes beyond the edge gateway. The communication is event-based involving publish-subscribe between related nodes. Clusters are identified in an autonomic fashion based on multi-criteria proximity. Local decisions can combine global and local context information to establish network slices in a decentralized fashion based on application demands. Moreover, such decisions may be part of a collaborative effort (map-reduce) based on either local or global context. Application demands expressed as such are modeled compatible with Open Data initiatives. We demonstrated feasibility of the approach and evaluate its advantages over the 5G architecture involving an edge gateway.},

abstract = {Blockchain Technologies, known as BCT have been praised by most people as a new and revolutionary means of ensuring secure and transparent data sharing and record keeping with potential uses in a number of sectors. The government sector is one of them. The potentials of DLTs are among the motivating reasons why most government agencies are looking to this technology to help make them become more efficient, accountable, cost-effective, and transparent. Some, on the other hand, are looking for ways in which the DLTs can help increase the trust in government agencies as well as various governmental institutions. Despite the endless potentials of the DLTs, they are still in infant stage and at the same time having a number of risks that may deter its future integration and use. This paper proposes a framework towards the integration of DLTs into government organizations of various levels like municipalities and public services that will help in introduction of them in governmental tasks such as digital ID management, secure document handling and voting while keeping them simple for administrators to use and apply in every organization and domain.},

Centralized systems typically assume the knowledge of location, planned path, status of all mobile robots in the system. This paper presents a simulation-based decentralized path planning method that has a traffic prediction and avoidance component. The method is applied to autonomous mobile robots in a warehouse environment. Given only the starting, pick-up, and drop-off locations of the other robots in the system, we utilize a deep-learning algorithm to predict heavy traffic zones with the goal of minimizing travel time. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation analysis to demonstrate the capabilities of the method.},

Its indivisible, unique, and verifiable characteristics can truly reflect personal assets and virtual assets to a certain extent. It is widely applied by users in art, games, collectibles and other areas. NFT is stored on the blockchain. The user's digital signature is embedded into the NFT record, which is distributed through a smart contract and verified by the blockchain consensus mechanism, thus solving the problem of identity confirmation in digital asset transactions. This paper makes a review of the main processes and key technologies in NFT applications. First, it introduces the life of NFT: minting, distribution, storage and circulation. Then, the key technologies of NFT are explained, including the blockchain smart contracts and consensus mechanisms in NFT distribution and transaction, the token standards that the minting and transaction process of NFT needs to use, and the important role of NFT in the field of web3. Finally, through the evaluation system of NFT, the problems existing in the current NFT applications and the future research direction are drawn out.},

To meet the demand for an increased system autonomy these CPSs need to continuously adapt to the dynamic environment or context in which they operate. As a result, there is the necessity to design systems that self-adapt and optimize their system state autonomously in response to different run-time context changes. However, making a decision on the optimal adaptation in a changing context is a complex task. In response, in this paper, we proposing a modular analysis and planning approach, which generates the optimal adaptations based on individual sub-decisions. Each sub-decision corresponds to an adaptation module which focuses on a specific parts of the context.},

Femto-cells can improve user experience in indoor locations, and increase overall system capacity with modest monetary investment. But the unplanned dynamic nature of these cells, significantly complicate resource allocation and interference control. We propose a relatively simple, decentralised market-oriented scheme for sub-channel and power allocation when femto-cell users co-exist with those of an OFDMA macro-cell. Our scheme utilises the Dutch auction (price progressively falls until a participant buys the object). Special "confirmation messages" are used to control interference, achieve channel reuse across Femto-cells, and mitigate the "hidden terminal" problem. Secure software inside each terminal may record transactions for eventual payment collection, or the auction can be interpreted as a prioritised decentralised allocation algorithm, without real money exchange.},

abstract = {Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are expected to enable reliable, efficient, and intelligent transportation systems. Most motion-planning algorithms for multi-agent systems implicitly assume that all vehicles/agents will execute the expected plan with a small error and evaluate their safety constraints based on this fact. This assumption, however, is hard to keep for CAVs since they may have to change their plan (e.g., to yield to another vehicle) or are forced to stop (e.g., a CAV may break down). While it is desired that a CAV never gets involved in an accident, it may be hit by other vehicles and, sometimes, preventing the accident is impossible (e.g., getting hit from behind while waiting at a red light). Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) is a set of safety rules that defines the objective of CAVs to blame, instead of safety. Thus, instead of developing a CAV algorithm that will avoid any accident, it ensures that the ego vehicle will not be blamed for any accident it is a part of. Original RSS rules, however, are hard to evaluate for merge, intersection, and unstructured road scenarios, plus RSS rules do not prevent deadlock situations among vehicles. In this article, we propose a new formulation for RSS rules that can be applied to any driving scenario. We integrate the proposed RSS rules with the CAV’s motion planning algorithm to enable cooperative driving of CAVs. We use Control Barrier Functions to enforce safety constraints and compute the energy optimal trajectory for the ego CAV. Finally, to ensure liveness, our approach detects and resolves deadlocks in a decentralized manner. We have conducted different experiments to verify that the ego CAV does not cause an accident no matter when other CAVs slow down or stop. We also showcase our deadlock detection and resolution mechanism using our simulator. Finally, we compare the average velocity and fuel consumption of vehicles when they drive autonomously with the case that they are autonomous and connected.},

abstract = {AGERE! 2013 was the third iteration of AGERE! held alongside SPLASH. The workshop -- which focuses on concerns of modelling, design and programming of systems, where decentralized control is an underlying assumption -- has emerged as a venue that brings together approaches from a family of paradigms variously referred to as Actors, active objects, agents, etc. Actors and more broadly object-oriented concurrent programming -- which couple object-oriented programming with concurrency -- offer a clean and powerful model for computation, which is gaining in popularity with adoption in mainstream languages, frameworks and libraries. Agents and agent-oriented programming provide a further layer of abstraction on top of actors and objects, conceiving concurrent/distributed systems as organizations of autonomous task-oriented entities featuring proactive and reactive behaviors, and interacting in a shared environment.The growing interest in libraries and frameworks supporting Actors or Actor-like mechanisms for use in mainstream platforms calls for tackling of both conceptual and practical hurdles that practitioners may face in using them. For example, how do we best integrate active and passive entities or entities based on different models of concurrency? More generally, it calls for tackling all those problems which become important as soon as these approaches start aiming to become the solution of choice for modelling, designing and programming large and complex software systems.Accordingly, AGERE!'s general theme has evolved to address the question of how these models and abstractions can help improve the way we think about about problems, the way we design, implement, test and validate models and systems, and finally, inform the tools we develop to aid these processes.AGERE! 2013 hosted two invited lectures, one by Yoshiki Ohshima from VPRI and another by Ole Lehrmann Madsen. Ohshima's talk -- titled "The future of personal computing system construction" -- reporting VPRI's work as part of the the STEP project -- discussed how the complexity of system construction can be tackled by creating meta-languages which allow us to build and experiment with new domain-specific languages. With these new languages, we can describe different parts of systems in a cleaner and more intention-revealing manner. From a conceptual point of view, objects remain the fundamental building blocks of the approach; however, decentralization of control and asynchronous interactions - alongside synchronous ones - appear to be a part of the foundation as well. Madsen's talk -- titled "SIMULA style concurrent objects" -- introduced sub-pattern restrictions as a mechanism used for defining safe concurrency abstractions in a new experimental version of Beta. Besides specific mechanisms, Beta -- being the successor of Simula -- has been designed to naturally support the modelling of concurrent activities, where Simula was originally designed to model and simulate activities in the real world.},

abstract = {Autonomous drones represent a new breed of mobile computing system. Compared to smartphones and connected cars that only opportunistically sense or communicate, drones allow motion control to become part of the application logic. The efficiency of their movements is largely dictated by the low-level control enabling their autonomous operation based on high-level inputs. Existing implementations of such low-level control operate in a time-triggered fashion. In contrast, we conceive a notion of reactive control that allows drones to execute the low-level control logic only upon recognizing the need to, based on the influence of the environment onto the drone operation. As a result, reactive control can dynamically adapt the control rate. This brings fundamental benefits, including more accurate motion control, extended lifetime, and better quality of service in end-user applications. Based on 260+ hours of real-world experiments using three aerial drones, three different control logic, and three hardware platforms, we demonstrate, for example, up to 41\% improvements in motion accuracy and up to 22\% improvements in flight time.},

To address these problems, this research proposes an agent-based decentralised process management framework for Web service composition. This framework allows distributed BPEL engines, each of which is represented by a software agent, to manage the execution of relevant sub-processes, and to interact with one another directly to coordinate the execution of the whole process. Such a framework naturally reflects the distributed and dynamic features of the Web services environment and subsequently offers improved coordination support for service composition provision.},

abstract = {Low-cost mini-drones with advanced sensing and maneuverability enable a new class of intelligent sensing systems. To achieve the full potential of such drones, it is necessary to develop new enhanced formulations of both common and emerging sensing scenarios. Namely, several fundamental challenges in visual sensing are yet to be solved including (1) fitting sizable targets in camera frames; (2) positioning cameras at effective viewpoints matching target poses; and (3) accounting for occlusion by elements in the environment, including other targets. In this article, we introduce Argus, an autonomous system that utilizes drones to collect target information incrementally through a two-tier architecture. To tackle the stated challenges, Argus employs a novel geometric model that captures both target shapes and coverage constraints. Recognizing drones as the scarcest resource, Argus aims to minimize the number of drones required to cover a set of targets. We prove this problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate, before deriving a best-possible approximation algorithm along with a competitive sampling heuristic which runs up to 100\texttimes{} faster according to large-scale simulations. To test Argus in action, we demonstrate and analyze its performance on a prototype implementation. Finally, we present a number of extensions to accommodate more application requirements and highlight some open problems.},

abstract = {Supply Chain Formation involves determining the participants and the exchange of goods within a production network. Today's companies operate autonomously, making local decisions, and coordinating with other companies to buy and sell goods along their Supply Chains. Such temporal interactions need to be formed rapidly and in a decentralized manner. For sufficiently large problems, current state-of-the-art approaches for Decentralized Supply Chain Formation are only capable of either (i) producing Supply Chains of high value at the expense of high resource requirements; or (ii) require low resources at the expense of producing Supply Chains of low value. In this paper we describe an algorithm that is able to produce Supply Chains of high value while keeping a low resource usage profile. Moreover, our method is able to produce near optimal Supply Chains while using up to four orders of magnitude less resources that the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {We present a distributed approach to self-organization in a distributed sensor network. The agents in the system use a series of negotiations incrementally to form appropriate coalitions of sensor and processing resources.Since the system is cooperative, we have developed a range of protocols that allow the agents to share meta-level information before they allocate resources. On one extreme the protocols are based on local utility computations, where each agent negotiates based on its local perspective. From there, a continuum of additional protocols exists in which agents base decisions on marginal social utility, the combination of an agent's marginal utility and that of others. We present a formal framework that allows us to quantify how social an agent can be in terms of the set of agents that are considered and how the choice of a certain level affects the decisions made by the agents and the global utility of the organization.Our results show that by implementing social agents, we obtain an organization with a high global utility both when agents negotiate over complex contracts and when they negotiate over simple ones. The main difference between the two cases is mainly the rate of convergence. Our algorithm is incremental, and therefore the organization that evolves can adapt and stabilize as agents enter and leave the system.},

abstract = {Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications.In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we evaluated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.},

abstract = {Recent advancements of blockchain technologies ensure security and trustability of Community Currency Systems (CCSs), enabling their increasingly widespread adoption. These systems aim at empowering the local economies by virtue of a medium of exchange whose governance and circulation are local. Smart contracts enable the enforcement of token economy policies, which facilitate the experimentation of radically new economic models. Recent studies investigated blockchain-based CCSs. Still, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing a CCS providing a token-based Universal Basic Income (UBI). We evaluate the Circles UBI decentralised application utility in delivering an unconditional income to its users, focusing on its main pilot project running in Berlin. We analyse the structural changes in the network, especially in relation to a subsidy program, involving local businesses. We also identify prominent users based on centrality measures, and investigate how the UBI was effectively spent. We adopt a method agnostic to the economic context to identify optimal aggregation windows for the temporal network of CCS transactions based on the Causal Fidelity (CF) index. This aims to provide static representations as accurate as possible in terms of sequential order of edges, which aspect was not considered in previous research on CCSs. Our findings suggest that the pilot project sustained the expansion of the economic network and the system facilitated trade in urban communities in Berlin. Future research is needed to identify methods to ensure sustainability of self-organised CCSs adopting a UBI issuance scheme and to further decentralise their governance.},

Our accounting scheme relies on the observed relative performance among the parties. It is totally autonomous in the sense that it uses only local information, i.e. there is no exchange of information between the parties. This allows for the deployment of the autonomous accounting without requiring any sort of identification infrastructure, such as certificate authorities. The no need of trust or sophisticated infrastructure make our accounting scheme a perfect fit for peer-to-peer grids, which aim to scale much further than traditional grids by allowing free unidentified entry into the grid. Our results show that the proposed scheme performs very close to a perfect accounting scheme whose implementation is infeasible in most systems, including those we target. Although our autonomous accounting scheme was developed to work with OurGrid, it can also be useful for other systems. The basic requirement to use our accounting scheme is that resource consumers must also be resource providers.},

Despite its usefulness, there are privacy and ethical issues with the typically centralised approach to Predictive Learning Analytics. In this positioning paper, it is proposed that the issues associated with Predictive Learning Analytics can be alleviated, in a framework called EMPRESS, by combining 1) self-sovereign data, where data owners control who legitimately has access to data pertaining to them, 2) Federated Learning, where the data remains on the data owner’s device and/or the data is processed by the data owners themselves, and 3) Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous graphs, which are examples of knowledge graphs.},

abstract = {Traffic management in urban areas is a challenging task. Provisioning of traffic moving on the roads becomes crucial especially when emergency services such as an ambulance or fire-fighting team need to make their way to the hospital or to the point where the problem is. With the advent of networking technologies, the traffic signals can now be equipped with sensing and communicating equipment facilitating the diversion of such vehicles along shorter and less crowded paths towards their respective destinations. This paper exploits the concept of an Internet of Things comprising the various traffic signaling equipments, and proposes a distributed mobile agent based mechanism to autonomously discover, create and manage a partial green corridor just ahead of the emergency vehicle along the least crowded path to its destination. The proposed mechanism assumes a network of equipment used for traffic signaling as its base and makes use of intelligent mobile software agents to facilitate the smooth movement of an emergency service vehicle. We have implemented the proposed mechanism by emulating the network of traffic signals and mobile agents using a mobile agent platform. The movement of the ambulance and the traffic flowing on the roads has been at the moment simulated. Our implementation and results obtained emphasize that the proposed mechanism can prove to be a viable solution for the movement of emergency vehicles in urban traffic.},

abstract = {In a decentralized storage system, agents replicate each other’s data to increase availability. Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners’ availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents’ availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents’ matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running.We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an “adoption” mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents.},

Furthermore, centralized orchestration is infeasible for the composite of services beyond enterprise boundaries. Decentralized orchestration approaches are therefore devised to overcome these drawbacks. Decentralized orchestration, however, is generally regarded as more complex for certain orchestration management tasks due to absence of centralized states. Among the challenging tasks are fault handling and recovery. This paper presents fault handling and recovery of composite services in a decentralized orchestration approach that is based on continuation-passing messaging.

abstract = {A central problem in environmental sensing and monitoring is to classify/label the hotspots in a large-scale environmental field. This paper presents a novel decentralized active robotic exploration (DARE) strategy for probabilistic classification/labeling of hotspots in a Gaussian process (GP)-based field. In contrast to existing state-of-the-art exploration strategies for learning environmental field maps, the time needed to solve the DARE strategy is independent of the map resolution and the number of robots, thus making it practical for in situ, real-time active sampling. Its exploration behavior exhibits an interesting formal trade-off between that of boundary tracking until the hotspot region boundary can be accurately predicted and wide-area coverage to find new boundaries in sparsely sampled areas to be tracked. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the active exploration performance of the DARE strategy: under reasonable conditional independence assumption, we prove that it can optimally achieve two formal cost-minimizing exploration objectives based on the misclassification and entropy criteria. Importantly, this result implies that the uncertainty of labeling the hotspots in a GP-based field is greatest at or close to the hotspot region boundaries. Empirical evaluation on real-world plankton density and temperature field data shows that, subject to limited observations, DARE strategy can achieve more superior classification of hotspots and time efficiency than state-of-the-art active exploration strategies.},

abstract = {Data collaboration enables multiple parties to pool data for deriving meaningful data insights. However, data misuse and unlawful data collection have led to precautionary measures being imposed by individual organizations to guide against data leakage and abuse. As a response, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has emerged as an attractive paradigm to facilitate data collaboration while being amenable to privacy-preserving data and knowledge sharing, cost reduction, and prediction accuracy improvement. Unfortunately, the participating parties in DFL tend to be heterogeneous with skew datasets and uneven capabilities. Inevitably, training and transmission costs, and the presence of free-riders pose challenges to the adoption and participation of DFL. The absence of centralized parameter servers further exacerbates the problem of evaluating the contribution of each individual party. Therefore, an effective incentive mechanism is essential to promote data collaboration.In this paper, we propose a novel Incentive-aware Decentralized fEderated leArning (IDEA) framework for facilitating data collaboration. Specifically, we first design a customizable reward scheme for heterogeneous parties to optimize their respective objectives such as higher model accuracy, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. To reward fairly to deserving parties while offering flexibility, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) incentive mechanism, which enables heterogeneous parties to learn their own optimal collaboration policy. We then design an efficient decentralized data collaboration algorithm that supports the customizable reward scheme based on individual objective-specific collaboration policy. We theoretically prove that the algorithm achieves a Nash equilibrium, which ensures the fairness of the corresponding rewards for parties. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework against four baselines on five real-world datasets. The results show that IDEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and accumulated reward.},

abstract = {Many distributed applications rely on forms of event correlation, which result in atomic delivery of multiple events aggregated by following process-specific criteria. Generally, more than one process is aggregating events, implying that events are multicast. While delivery guarantees for multicast scenarios with single event/message delivery are well understood, existing systems and models for aggregated deliveries either consider only unicast, centralized setups, or focus on efficiency thus providing only best-effort guarantees.This paper first reviews properties and grammar previously proposed for decentralized event correlation. While these properties compose an essential set for fair correlation of events in a decentralized setting, there are further properties that may be explored. This paper will also discuss these additional properties and describe the challenges and open questions they present.},

abstract = {The use of autonomous robots for delivery of goods to customers is an exciting new way to provide a reliable and sustainable service. However, in the real world, autonomous robots still require human supervision for safety reasons. We tackle the real-world problem of optimizing autonomous robot timings to maximize deliveries, while ensuring that there are never too many robots running simultaneously so that they can be monitored safely. We assess the use of a recent hybrid machine-learning-optimization approach COIL (constrained optimization in learned latent space) and compare it with a baseline genetic algorithm for the purposes of exploring variations of this problem. We also investigate new methods for improving the speed and efficiency of COIL. We show that only COIL can find valid solutions where appropriate numbers of robots run simultaneously for all problem variations tested. We also show that when COIL has learned its latent representation, it can optimize 10\% faster than the GA, making it a good choice for daily re-optimization of robots where delivery requests for each day are allocated to robots while maintaining safe numbers of robots running at once.},

abstract = {Multi-agent problem domains may require distributed algorithms for a variety of reasons: local sensors, limitations of communication, and availability of distributed computational resources. In the absence of these constraints, centralized algorithms are often more efficient, simply because they are able to take advantage of more information. We introduce a variant of the cooperative target observation domain which is free of such constraints. We propose two algorithms, inspired by K-means clustering and hill-climbing respectively, which are scalable in degree of decentralization. Neither algorithm consistently outperforms the other across over all problem domain settings. Surprisingly, we find that hill-climbing is sensitive to degree of decentralization, while K-means is not. We also experiment with a combination of the two algorithms which draws strength from each.},

However, the transparency of blockchain networks and the open mechanism of DeFi applications also cause new security issues. In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.},

Steering committees were utilized more often with a generalized IS manager than with a specialized telecommunications manager. Organizations with steering committees were more likely to provide organizational support for the telecommunications function than the other organizations. There was no statistical significance between organizations with steering committees and those without such a committee on the development and implementation of a telecommunications plan. However, there was a strong correlation between the decision-making authority of the steering committee and the development and implementation of a telecommunications plan.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Programming based on Actors, Agents, and Decentralized Control (AGERE!). The latest edition of the AGERE! workshop confirms its role as a unique venue in the research landscape bringing together researchers and practitioners interested in actors, agents and, more generally, high-level paradigms emphasizing decentralized control in thinking, modeling, developing, and reasoning about programs and software systems.The fundamental turn of software into concurrency and distribution is not only a matter of performance, but also of design and abstraction. It calls for programming paradigms that, compared to current mainstream paradigms, would allow us to more naturally think about, design, develop, execute, debug, and profile systems exhibiting different degrees of concurrency, autonomy, decentralization of control, and physical distribution.AGERE! is an ACM SIGPLAN workshop dedicated to focusing on and developing research on programming systems, languages and applications based on actors, agents and any related programming paradigm promoting a decentralized mindset in solving problems and in developing systems to implement such solutions.All stages of software development are considered interesting for the workshop, including requirements, modeling, formalization, prototyping, design, implementation, tooling, testing, and any other means of producing running software based on actors and agents as first-class abstractions. The scope of the workshop includes aspects that concern both the theory and the practice of design and programming using such paradigms, so as to bring together researchers working on models, languages and technologies, as well as practitioners using such technologies to develop real-world systems and applications.The workshop was organized as a one-day workshop, integrating both: a part featuring a mini-conference style, like previous editions, reserving some time slots for the presentation and discussion of those accepted contributions that are meant to be published in the formal proceedings.a part featuring a brainstorming style, more targeted to solicit the discussion of ideas/challenges/new directions, etc. raised by the set of position/work-in-progress papers submitted to the workshop and selected by the PC.The workshop welcomed three main kinds of contributions: Mature contributions: full papers presenting new previously unpublished research in one or more of the topics of the workshop.Position papers and work-in-progress contributions: short papers introducing a contribution (an idea, a viewpoint, an argument, work-in-progress, etc.) which may be in its initial stage and not fully developed but which is worth being presented given its relevance to the AGERE! topics, to trigger discussions and interactions.Demos: these contributions describe a technology/system presented and discussed during the event.Posters: these contributions are aimed to exploit the event to discuss (with other participants) an idea and get feedback for future work.AGERE! 2014 received 14 submissions, of which 9 full papers were accepted to be included in these proceedings.Since the first edition, a main objective of the workshop has been to explore and foster the adoption of actors, agents and paradigms based on a decentralized control as a more high-level and effective alternative --- from an abstraction point of view in particular --- to mainstream approaches such as multi-threaded programming. Among others, this calls for devising technologies featuring a good level of maturity and performance. This is reflected by the contributions accepted in this edition.},

In contrast to this approach, we propose the ACIDE framework: A completely decentralized, bottom-up clustering process and information exchange that does not depend on given infrastructure such as fixed root nodes. While it has slightly higher requirements for the nodes, its dynamic and independent nature has many advantages, such as the user beeing able to initiate queries from any point in the network rather than being limited to query the network through an a priori fixed sink node. The framework can deal with changing environments and energy depletion. Through careful abstraction, we also support customization and adaption to different environments.},

abstract = {Workflow systems are gaining importance as an infrastructure for automating inter-organizational interactions, such as those in Electronic Commerce. Execution of inter-organiz-ational workflows may raise a number of security issues including those related to conflict-of-interest among competing organizations. Moreover, in such an environment, a centralized Workflow Management System is not desirable because: (i) it can be a performance bottleneck, and (ii) the systems are inherently distributed, heterogeneous and autonomous in nature. In this paper, we propose an approach to realize decentralized workflow execution, in which the workflow is divided into partitions called self-describing workflows, and handled by a light weight workflow management component, called workflow stub, located at each organizational agent. We argue that placing the task execution agents that belong to the same conflict-of-interest class in one self-describing workflow may lead to unfair, and in some cases, undesirable results, akin to being on the wrong side of the Chinese wall. We propose a Chinese wall security model for the decentralized workflow environment to resolve such problems, and a restrictive partitioning solution to enforce the proposed model.},

However, there is a dearth of research characterizing online impression management in the context of youth empowerment organizations. To address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study investigating the use of SNS in a youth empowerment organization. Using Goffman's dramaturgical model, we characterized how youth tried to hack SNS algorithms, and their desire to better identify their audience. Our findings reveal how youth use SNS to create authentic images and connections with their audience. On the other hand, we discuss adults' desire to convey a curated organizational image and challenges that arose. We conclude with design implications for tools that support impression management online for youth activists.},

Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and model based—limitations that we address by distributed reinforcement learning (RL). We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL. However, alternate learning requires an initial policy. We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach. We empirically demonstrate that the refined approach produces near-optimal solutions in many challenging benchmark settings, staking a claim to being an efficient (and realistic) approximate solver in its own right. Furthermore, alternate best response learning seeded with such policies quickly learns high-quality policies as well.},

abstract = {The evolution of the business networks is fostering the demand for more connected devices to execute tangled and sophisticated business operations. This leverages complicated business networks space to include scalable network layers, more devices, and platforms relying on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Despite the fact that traditional IoT platforms usually target the technical side for IoT applications, they are not prepared enough to be easily integrated with pluggable and executable business logic or smart contracts. This makes it difficult to control a collection of shared business network resources in a standard and decentralized manner. With the rise of FinTech due to blockchain technology, it becomes possible to seamlessly engage business networks with financial digital assets. Consequently, combining IoT platforms with blockchain will drive new ways for better services consuming, transparency and products that depend on crowd-based economy [12]. In this paper, Sitechain is proposed as a new architecture to integrate IoT platforms with blockchain technology. The proposed architecture is not locked to specific IoT platforms but it can be extended to support different platforms in a standard, systematic and easy way. Sitechain is demonstrated by integrating Sitewhere and FIWARE IoT platforms with Hyperledger Fabric as a private blockchain network manager. Moreover a modeling language supported by Hyperledger composer is used to easily develop smart contracts and generate RESTful APIs, therefore any smart contract transaction events can be mapped into actions on remote devices.The system testing is performed using a large set of connected shared devices that are deployed as part of private business networks. The results are recorded in the conclusion section.},

BC is comprised of five core stages, but the focus of this paper is on BC 2.0, specifically smart contracts. Smart contracts are utilized to ensure appropriate access controls and the enforcement of contracts. Digital signatures are essential for transactions in smart contracts, and various signature algorithms are employed, including ECDSA and EdDSA. The research problem is to compare and contrast the levels of security offered by two digital signature algorithms, ECDSA and EdDSA, which are employed in smart contracts. The primary objective of this study is to determine which digital signature algorithm performs better in terms of security.},
