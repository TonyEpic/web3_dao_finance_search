abstract = {Despite the increase in the number of blockchain-based Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), there is no consensus on what constitutes a DAO. This paper provides an in-depth study of DAOs by analyzing their definitions, characteristics, and emerging developments. Existing definitions in the literature hardly recognize common functionalities and intermingle coded DAOs, DAO deployment platforms, and blockchain DAOs. We developed a comprehensive DAO definition by reviewing the literature and empirically analyzing 1,859 DAOs. The findings show that many DAOs were inactive and that a threshold of 20 tokenholders is a tipping point for DAOs to survive over time and maintain sustained levels of activity. Finally, based on an empirical analysis of 9,845 perceived DAOs, we identified the emerging development of off-chain voting. This emerging development challenges the autonomous nature of DAOs. We recommend further research to investigate the effect of governance structures on their long-term sustainability and viability for both on-chain and off-chain DAOs.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

However, on the one hand, the inability to reach mutual trust between unfamiliar entities limits the collaboration of entities, and on the other hand, most of the profits in the industrial chain are grabbed by the dominant enterprises. In this paper, an information system for collaboration among business entities is developed based on blockchain, based on which a business model called Decentralized Industry Alliance (DIA) is proposed. Transactions and profit distribution in the DIA are executed by smart contracts, which enables unfamiliar entities to trust each other without relying on a third party. Any entity that voluntarily complies with the smart contracts automatically becomes a member of the DIA, thereby promoting the expansion of the industry scale. The smart contracts distribute profits according to each entity’s contribution to the alliance, so as to ensure the fairness of value distribution. A case about the alliance of elderly care industry is carried out, which shows that the DIA achieves rapid expansion on the premise of ensuring fairness. As a general business model in the web 3.0 era, the DIA can be referenced by other industries.}

abstract = {Objective
To explore the potential molecular targets of Cang Fu Dao Tan Formula (CFDTF) in the treatment of obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using network pharmacology and bioinformatic approaches.
Methods
The potential blood-entry active compounds and targets of CFDTF were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and obese PCOS related gene targets were retrieved from GeneCard databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of CFDTF component-targets and obese PCOS disease- targets was constructed using STRING. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the intersection network were conducted using a Bioconductor database.
Results
In total, 114 active compounds were screened according to oral bioavailability (OB) and drug similarity (DL), and 328 targets related to these constituents were obtained. Further, 2 559 target genes directly related to obese PCOS were obtained from the GeneCard databases, and 82 genes were obtained from the intersection of the component-target and disease-target PPI network. These genes were mainly involved in response to steroid hormones, nutrient levels and lipopolysaccharide as well as in other biological processes. Their molecular functions were mainly related to nuclear receptor activity, phosphatase binding and cytokine activity, and they were enriched in the cytoplasm, cell membrane and membrane region.
Conclusions
CFDTF consists of 114 active compounds that are responsible for its pharmacodynamic effects. It mainly regulates the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, bladder cancer, and hepatitis B and in other signaling networks. These findings provide certain theoretical and scientific basis for the treatment of obese PCOS with Chinese medicine.}

Smart contracts consists of computer code that composed set of rules agreed upon by the involved parties. When these predefined conditions or rules are satisfied by the transactions initiated by parties, the smart contract executes itself to complete the transaction. Normally, while performing transactions with agreements involving multiple parties, a third party have to be involve to verify all the information, which makes it complex and time consuming process. Smart contracts simplify this process by eliminating the third party and automating the process, enabling the stakeholders to perform transactions directly with each other. Smart contract itself is replicated among multiple nodes of a blockchain there by giving benefits of immutability, security and permanence. Most smart contracts are written in Solidity programming language due to its simplicity and conciseness. Attackers are attracted by the popularity of Solidity language and its vulnerability possibilities. For example, in the 2016 year, 60 million US dollars was theft by Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack due to vulnerabilities present in smart contracts. There are few existing tools and papers on this area to find vulnerabilities on smart contracts but taking more time to predict. Thus, this paper presents different Deep learning techniques with satisfactory results to identify smart contract vulnerabilities which are Re-entrancy, Denial of Service (DOS) and Transaction Origin using binary, multi class and multi label classification techniques.}

Our aim is to explore how toolkits theory applies to Web3 innovation, proposing that Web3 innovation is being organized through toolkits (e.g., blockchains, token standards, DAO frameworks) that enable efficient organization of sticky information to facilitate innovation. The contribution of this paper is the first application of toolkits theory to Web3, reframing its development as a problem of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of distributed information. We provide implications for the role of developers as user innovators, the economic problem of emergent toolkit stacking, and the design of toolkit business models.}

Ethereum thus enables global, unincorporated associations to conduct governance experiments. Such experiments are crucial to Decentralised Finance (DeFi). DeFi is a nascent field of unlicensed, unregulated, and non-custodial financial services that utilise public distributed ledgers and crypto-assets rather than corporate structures and sovereign currencies. The inaugural Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index, launched in August 2021, included nine Ethereum-based projects – non-custodial exchanges as well as lending and derivatives platforms. Each project is governed, at least in part, by unregistered holders of tokenised voting rights (also known as governance tokens). Token-holders typically vote for or against coders’ improvement proposals that pertain to anything from the allocation of treasury funds to a collateral’s risk parameters. DeFi’s governance thus depends on the distribution and exercise of tokenised voting rights. Since archetypal DeFi projects are not managed by companies or public institutions, not much is known about DeFi’s governance. Regulators and law-makers from the United States recently asked if DeFi’s governance entails a new class of “shadowy” elites. In response, we conducted an exploratory multiple-case study that focused on the tokenised voting rights issued by the nine projects from Bloomberg’s inaugural Galaxy DeFi index. Our mixed methods approach drew on Ethereum-based data about the distribution, trading, staking, and delegation of voting rights tokens, as well as project documentation and archival records. We discovered that DeFi projects’ voting rights are highly concentrated, and the exercise of these rights is very low. Our theoretical contribution is a philosophical intervention: minority rule, not “democracy”, is the probable outcome of token-tradable voting rights and a lack of applicable anti-concentration laws. We interpret DeFi’s minority rule as timocratic.}

Heavy feeds suitable for the production of lubricating oils include vacuum gas oil (VGO) and deasphalted oil (DAO), because the substantial portion of these feeds boils above 400˚C. The crudes from which VGO and DAO were obtained influence the overall processing scheme. For example, VGO and DAO derived from naphthenic crude are more suitable for the production of lubricants than those derived from aromatic crude. Although of non-petroleum origin, the wax by-product of the FT synthesis has been identified as an important feed for the production of lubricating oils. The advances in catalyst development resulted in the process that can readily hydroisomerize the wax by-product to produce the lube base oil, possessing similar properties as that derived from petroleum feeds. Middle distillates and AGO are other feeds that may require dewaxing to meet the final products specifications. Conventional dewaxing involved the removal of aromatics by extraction, using solvents such as furfural and phenols. In a concentrated form, aromatics were separated from the solvent by distillation. The extraction of aromatics was usually followed by the removal of long-chain paraffins. The removal of aromatics was necessary to improve viscosity behavior, whereas the removal of paraffins to improve cold flow properties of lubricating oils. Middle distillates used for the preparation of fuels require a similar dewaxing, as it is used for the preparation of lubricants.}

Waddington's concepts of ‘chreods’ (canalized paths of development) and ‘homeorhesis’ (the tendency to return to a path), each associated with ‘morphogenetic fields’, were conceived by him as a contribution to complexity theory. Subsequent developments in complexity theory have largely ignored Waddington's work and efforts to advance it. Waddington explained the development of the concept of chreod as the influence on his work of Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, notably, the concept of concrescence as a self-causing process. Processes were recognized as having their own dynamics, rather than being explicable through their components or external agents. Whitehead recognized the tendency to think only in terms of such ‘substances’ as a bias of European thought, claiming in his own philosophy ‘to approximate more to some strains of Indian, or Chinese, thought, than to western Asiatic, or European, thought.’ Significantly, the theoretical biologist who comes closest to advancing Waddington's research program, also marginalized, is Mae-Wan Ho. Noting this bias, and embracing Whitehead's and Waddington's efforts to free biology from assumptions dominating Western thought to advance an ontology of creative causal processes, I will show how later developments of complexity theory, most importantly, Goodwin's work on oscillations, temporality and morphology, Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics, Salthe's work on hierarchy theory, biosemiotics inspired by Peirce and von Uexküll, Robert Rosen's work on anticipatory systems, together with category theory and biomathics, can augment while being augmented by Waddington's work, while further advancing Mae-Wan Ho's radical research program with its quest to understand the reality of consciousness.}

Their management is decentralized without top executive teams and built on automated rules encoded in smart contracts, and their governance works autonomously based on a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms that support community decision-making. A growing body of literature has emerged exploring DAOs. However, there is a considerable lack of clarity about this organizational design and its theoretical conceptualization. To this end, we undertake an integrative literature review that reveals three main principles—decentralized, automated and autonomous organizations—and the following four theoretical perspectives mainly adopted to examine this novel organizational form: transaction cost theory, institutions for collective action, agency theory, and socio-materiality. By extending these theories, we propose an integrative model of DAO for research and theory building. Our contribution provides conceptual clarity and proposes a framework for future research directions.}

As 6LoWPAN runs on resource-constrained devices like ultra-low powered micro-controllers and radio transceivers, therefore use of traditional routing protocols is not recommended. To solve the problem of achieving energy-efficient routing in 6LoWPAN, Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is specified by IETF. Although RPL gives many benefits to 6LoWPAN, but the research fraternity has raised many concerns regarding its security. One such security issue is the Dropped Destination Advertisement Object (DDAO) attack. In a DDAO attack, an attacker exploits the standard DAO forwarding technique of RPL to perform the attack without getting noticed. Using multiple experiments, we have observed that the key network performance parameters are severely affected by the DDAO attack. In this view, this paper proposes a novel lightweight Challenge-Response Authentication-based technique for securing RPL against DDAO attacks. The key idea of CRA-RPL is to use a modified version of control messages by incorporating challenge-response pair for authenticating DAO-ACK messages. CRA-RPL is implemented on a widely used Contiki-NG embedded operating system and validated on Cooja Simulator. Performance of CRA-RPL is compared with ContikiRPL (i.e., standard RPL implementation).

To resist malicious TPAs, a plethora of blockchain-based public auditing mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot effectively mitigate single point of failure and collusion between TPAs and miners. These schemes are burdened by significant wastage of storage resources due to the presence of redundant data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized auditing scheme supporting ciphertext deduplication (BDACD). BDACD leverages a decentralized blockchain, which takes over the role traditionally played by a centralized TPA. A decentralized autonomous organization is incorporated to enhance resistance against collusion attacks. By integrating advanced ciphertext deduplication techniques, BDACD effectively mitigates storage overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept, T-Merkle hash tree, along with a corresponding search algorithm. This innovation significantly enhances blockchain storage utilization and enables efficient half-interval searches within a block. To ensure accountability and fairness, a smart contract is employed to establish an arbitration mechanism. This mechanism serves a dual purpose: penalizing any malevolent actions by cloud servers and providing adequate compensation to data owners whose data integrity has been compromised. Detailed security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate BDACD has desirable security and efficiency.}

Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field.

abstract = {Blockchain and its related concept of decentral autonomous organization (DAO) is starting to influence project management. But how might project management supported by blockchain technology look like? And how would such a new form change and affect traditional project management? Not many concepts have been designed or even implemented yet. We chose an experimental framework to answer the first aspects of these questions. We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.}

abstract = {Botnet-originated DDoS attacks continue to plague the internet and disrupt services for legitimate users. While various proposals have been presented in the last two decades, the botnet still has advantages over the defenders, because botnets have orchestrated processes to launch disruptive attacks. On the other hand, the defenders use manual methods, siloed tools, and lack orchestration among different organizations. These unorchestrated efforts slow down the attack response and extend the lifespan of botnet attacks. This article presents shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN, an inter-organization collaborative defense framework using P4, SDN, and Blockchain, which extends our earlier research on microVNF, a solution of Edge security for SIP-enabled IoT devices with P4. Besides mitigating DDoS attacks, microVNF also produces attack fingerprints called Indicator of Compromise (IOC) records. ShieldSDN and shieldCHAIN distribute these IOCs to other organizations so that they can create their own packet filters. Effectively, shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN synchronize packet filters for different organizations to mitigate against the same botnet strain. Four experiments were performed successfully to validate the functionalities of shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN. The scope for the first experiment was intra-company, while the second, third, and fourth experiments were inter-company. In the first experiment, shieldSDN extracted IOCs from the source switch and installed these as packet filters on other switches within the same organization (in the U.S.). In the second experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the publishing organization (in the U.S.) shared IOCs by posting them to the Blockchain. In the third experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations (in Singapore & the U.K.) retrieved these IOCs from Blockchain. Finally, in the last experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations installed the retrieved IOCs as packet filters; that are identical to those in the originating organization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that uses the P4 switch, SDN controller, and Blockchain together for this use case. As SDN and Blockchain gain acceptance, this framework empowers community members to collaborate and defend against botnet DDoS attacks.}

Three themes emerge from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) voting structure, (2) proposal management, and (3) token management. Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose. However, the operations and methods implemented are more oriented toward agency viewpoints due to their reliance on incentive-based processing and are based on a lack of trust among DAO stakeholders. This study provides empirical insights into DAO governance mechanisms.11Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).}

While previous literature on project delivery models identifies the use of decentralized governance, there is not yet a holistic conceptualization nor a specific overview of governance applications that can be applied. To develop the concept, we use a literature review to synthesize fourteen blockchain governance mechanisms useful for managing the crypto-commons. Subsequently, we use systematic combining to identify twenty-two specific applications for decentralized project delivery in the construction industry, one of the largest project-based industries. Each application is briefly reviewed, and examples of their relevance to realize decentralized project delivery models are provided. We discuss the potential for novel forms of project delivery, but also the need for future research on the applications, as well as on the system level implications, the system design challenges, and the implementation barriers in the specific context of the construction industry. Overall, the concepts and mechanisms presented provide a theoretical foundation upon which future researchers can use to design novel decentralized project delivery models.}

abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.}

abstract = {Background
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), as a common endocrine disease in reproductive-age women, which is characterized by both reproductive and metabolic disorders. Cang-Fu-Dao-Tan Formula (CFDTF) is an effective and relatively safe treatment for PCOS. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood.
Purpose
To explore the effective compounds and mechanisms of CFDTF in treating PCOS based on UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, network pharmacology and molecular experiments.
Methods
The UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS and TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction databases were used to identify the active ingredients of CFDTF. Then GeneCards, Disgenet, Drugbank databases were used to obtain the PCOS related targets. Based above, the Drug-component-target (D-C-T) network and protein-protein-interaction (PPI) network were built to analysis the key targets. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were performed to find the potential mechanisms. Finally, molecular docking analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular experiments were used to confirm the interactions among the active compounds, targets and explore the potential mechanisms.
Results
A total of 20 compounds were identified by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, and 136 active compounds by TCMSP from CFDTF. After removing the duplicate results, there were 370 targets related to both CFDTF and PCOS, among which, MAPK3, AKT1, RELA, EGF, TP53 and MYC were proved to have high interactions with the components. The mechanisms of CFDTF against PCOS were related to PI3K-Akt, mTOR, MAPK signaling pathways, and the in vitro experiments proved that the CFDTF positively regulated the cell proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis levels in PCOS cell model.
Conclusions
The combination of UPLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS, systematic network pharmacology and molecular experiments identified that the quercetin, hesperidin, and glycyrrhizin disaccharide are the TOP 3 effective compounds of CFDTF in treating PCOS and the potential mechanisms may involve in regulating proliferation and apoptosis of granulosa cells.}

Here, we tested three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of DAO in a group of Korean schizophrenia patients, and found no significant association in the overall study subjects. Interestingly, however, we found gender-specific differences in allele distributions, with SNP rs2070586 appearing to act as a risk allele in female schizophrenia patients, but as a protective allele in males. Our data support the hypothesis that DAO plays a role in schizophrenia, possibly in a gender-dependent manner.}

In the second phase, we collected and examined code-related data from GitHub and market-related data from blockchain browsers (e.g., Etherscan) for these projects. Our analysis revealed that the Web3 ecosystem can be categorized into two groups, i.e., Web3 infrastructure and Web3 applications, with each consisting of several subcategories or subdomains. We also gained insights into the popularity of these Web3 projects at both the code and market levels and pointed out the challenges in the Web3 ecosystem at the system, developer, and user levels, as well as the opportunities it presents.

The framework is built upon a total of 34 articles on DAO and OSS governance. The framework was evaluated in three leading DAOs that produce OSS. The evaluation underscores the significance of the framework and proves the potential of the systematic categorization of governance mechanisms. Finally, we list emerging governance practices in various governance domains in this developing field.}

abstract = {Within the last two decades, communication technologies have evolved and continue evolving rapidly, and this caused significant advancements in Internet of Things applications and services. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, have numerous emerging applications in various domains of life and have attracted the interest of researchers because of their fundamental attributes such as mobility, flexibility, reliability, and energy efficiency in wireless networks. Similar to wireless sensor networks and other remote sensing applications, these devices are generally not designed with integrated security mechanisms. Furthermore, the existing solutions in which the main focus is on drone communication security are quite limited in the literature. Blockchain (BC) is defined as a list of data blocks as a publicly distributed ledger, which is linked together using cryptography such as hash functions and public key infrastructures. In this matter, cryptographic security issues have increased. Conventional UAVs mostly depend upon centralized servers, where the authentication mechanisms run. Therefore, in recent years, new, advanced authentication/privacy protection techniques have been designed and developed for the diversity of computer security requirements resulting in the introduction of different kinds of security models. One of these suggestions is to use a decentralized BC-based server to secure information. In order to make precise decisions, machine learning (ML) techniques are required to analyze and decide on secure data in the BC-based server. There are various traditional ML techniques, such as support vector machines, convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory to analyze the attacks on a BC-based network. However, there are a limited number of detailed studies in the literature on ML adoption for making BT-based networks more resilient against attacks. In this paper, various ML algorithm applications based on BC-based cryptographic algorithms for UAVs are discussed in detail, with some future research directions given.}

abstract = {Due to the nature of decentralization, blockchain-based applications are gradually adopted by more and more systems in different fields to replace centralized third-party agencies. Many applications, like blockchain oracles, rely on on-chain transactions to deliver information that is used to make final decisions. There have been many methods proposed to guarantee the correctness of the final results, and most of them are in terms of the management of information providers and the application's design. However, to our notice, only a few works have discussed the security threat caused by rational mining pools that are responsible for packing transactions and information into blocks and uploading them to the blockchain. Therefore in this paper, we propose a possible delayed packing attack carried out by rational mining pools against these transaction information based applications. Game theory analysis is conducted to obtain the Nash equilibrium strategy, and the price of anarchy is calculated to depict the success probability of such an attack under different circumstances. In addition, we design a countermeasure protocol based on cryptography tools to defend against the delayed packing attack. Finally, we carry out a thorough security analysis as well as corresponding experiments to prove the security and feasibility of our countermeasure.}

abstract = {A key component of blockchain technology is the ledger, viz., a database that, unlike standard databases, keeps in memory the complete history of past transactions as in a notarial archive for the benefit of any future test. In second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum, the ledger is coupled with smart contracts, which enable the automation of transactions associated with agreements between the parties of a financial or commercial nature. The coupling of smart contracts and ledgers provides the technological background for very innovative application areas, such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which propelled blockchains beyond cryptocurrencies that were the only focus of first generation blockchains, such as Bitcoin. However, the currently used implementation of smart contracts as arbitrary programming constructs has made them susceptible to dangerous bugs that can be exploited maliciously and has moved their semantics away from that of legal contracts. We propose here to recompose the split and recover the reliability of databases by formalizing a notion of contract modeled as a finite-state automaton with well-defined computational characteristics derived from encoding in terms of allocations of resources to actors, as an alternative to the approach based on programming. To complete the work, we use temporal logic as the basis for an abstract query language that is effectively suited to the historical nature of the information kept in the ledger.}

In this paper we aim to review the existing governance practices of established or popular blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems with a view to understanding how they hold up in times of crises. What questions are raised when they are compromised or faced consensus challenges in coordinating action especially around control and accountability? We use a translational process, generating focal insights about present concerns from the reference point of completed academic studies and extensive practitioner consultation. Rather than adopting a declarative approach attempting to provide all the answers, we draw insights from the IT platform governance literature to offer a critical perspective for asking the right questions around key governance issues in financial infrastructure such as decision rights, control mechanisms, and incentives.}

Our findings reveal that both factors significantly influence the efficiency of crypto-assets. Notably, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) exhibit higher efficiency compared to non-DAO projects. This suggests that transparent decentralized decision-making models can reduce information asymmetry, leading to a more efficient market pricing. Furthermore, we show a positive relationship between market efficiency and increased liquidity and age.

A public and auditable record of the environmental impact of each supply chain stage can be made using blockchain technology. A more streamlined and effective supply chain is made possible by blockchain's decentralized structure. Delays, mistakes, and the need for middlemen are decreased by real-time access to a shared ledger. IIoT devices like sensors and RFID tags can provide real-time data on the location, condition, and environmental parameters of goods. Blockchain can then be used to record and incentivize sustainable practices, such as reducing energy consumption or minimizing waste. The integration of blockchain with IIoT can develop the supply chain management for enabling real-time tracking of goods, optimizing inventory management, and ensuring compliance with sustainability standards. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the key challenges facing traditional supply chains and how the combined use of Blockchains and IIoT technologies. The review also evaluates the environmental, social, and economic implications of adopting Blockchain-enabled IIoT solutions in supply chain operations. Furthermore, the review assesses the current state of research and development, identifying gaps in existing literature and proposing avenues for future exploration. As a results, by highlighting the synergies between these technologies, it seeks to inspire further innovation and adoption, ultimately fostering a more resilient, transparent, and environmentally conscious industrial ecosystem.}

The package represents a first attempt to regulate a complex and emerging phenomenon, characterised by significant trade-offs. Unsurprisingly, in this early stage of the law-making process several relevant aspects of the crypto environment remain unaddressed, such as pure DeFI models, DAOs, and NFTs. Such regulatory gap is to a large extent attributable to the difficulty of addressing technologically complex issues through command-and-control top-down legislation. The improvements delivered by the Better Regulation Agenda are not enough to solve this conundrum. In this context, the Communication by the Bank of Italy on Decentralised Technology in Finance and Crypto-assets and its first move, the smart-contract MoU, provide an interesting case study to discuss the potential of ‘participatory regulation.’ This experimental form of regulation tries to get the most out of co-regulation, self-regulation, and command-and-control, combining their characters with the view of reconciling the technology neutrality principle with technology-based regulation. Participatory regulation aims to bridge the public and private sector in order to strike a right balance between flexibility and legal certainty, without stifling innovation.}

abstract = {In the information age, electronic documents (e-documents) have become a popular alternative to paper documents due to their lower costs, higher dissemination rates, and ease of knowledge sharing. However, digital copyright infringements occur frequently due to the ease of copying, which not only infringes on the rights of creators but also weakens their creative enthusiasm. Therefore, it is crucial to establish an e-document sharing system that enforces copyright protection. However, the existing centralized system has outstanding vulnerabilities, and the plagiarism detection algorithm used cannot fully detect the context, semantics, style, and other factors of the text. Digital watermark technology is only used as a means of infringement tracing. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for e-document sharing based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and non-fungible token (NFT) in blockchain. The use of blockchain as a distributed credit base resolves the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional centralized systems. The e-document evaluation and plagiarism detection mechanisms based on the DAO model effectively address challenges in comprehensive text information checks, thereby promoting the enhancement of e-document quality. The mechanism for protecting and circulating e-document copyrights using NFT technology ensures effective safeguarding of users’ e-document copyrights and facilitates e-document sharing. Moreover, recognizing the security issues within the DAO governance mechanism, we introduce an innovative optimization solution. Through experimentation, we validate the enhanced security of the optimized governance mechanism, reducing manipulation risks by up to 51%. Additionally, by utilizing evolutionary game analysis to deduce the equilibrium strategies of the framework, we discovered that adjusting the reward and penalty parameters of the incentive mechanism motivates creators to generate superior quality and unique e-documents, while evaluators are more likely to engage in assessments.}

Unlike other reactions, direct aerobic oxidation (DAO) of CAHs does not require growth substrates and avoids the generation of toxic by-products. Here, we critically review the current understanding of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons-DAO and its application in bioreactors and at the field scale. According to reports on chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons-DAO bacteria, isolates mainly consisted of Methylobacterium and Proteobacterium. Chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons-DAO bacteria are characterized by tolerance to a high concentration of CAHs and highly efficient removal of CAHs. Trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (t-DCE) is easily transformed biomass for bacteria, followed by 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), dichloromethane (DCM), vinyl chloride (VC) and cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (c-DCE). Significant differences in the maximum specific growth rates were observed with different CAHs and biometabolic pathways for DCM, 1,2-DCA, VC and c-DCE degradation have been successfully parsed. Detection of the functional genes etnC and etnE is useful for the determination of active VC DAO bacteria. Additionally, DAO bacteria have been successfully applied to CAHs in new types of bioreactors with satisfactory results. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, only one study on DAO-CAHs was conducted in-situ and resulted in 99% CAH removal. Lastly, we put forward future development prospect of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons-DAO.}

However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.}

However, by following the Bisq Trade Protocol and interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use novel address clustering heuristics to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We describe address clustering heuristics for both the Bisq Trade Protocol and the Bisq DAO. We show that the heuristics aggregate activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.}

The blockchain technology plays an important role in achieving efficient smart cities. Blockchain technology performs transactions across a wide network between untrusted parties in chronological order and digital ledgers in a decentralized database. The decentralized architecture of blockchain offers greater security for distributed systems. Although, there have been some concerns raised about the robustness of blockchain technology. Numerous cybersecurity flaws have been found in blockchain implementations. Blockchain technology enables transactions to be more transparent than the old centralized systems. Hence, the blockchain technology has been exposed to numerous vulnerable cyberattacks. As a result, cyberattacks lead to system breakdown, data loss, password thefts, and information theft.

Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.}

abstract = {Many IoT applications run on a wireless infrastructure supported by resource-constrained nodes which is popularly known as Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Currently, LLNs play a vital role in digital transformation of industries. The resource limitations of LLNs restrict the usage of traditional routing protocols and therefore require an energy-efficient routing solution. IETF’s Routing Protocol for Low-power Lossy Networks (RPL, pronounced “ripple”) is one of the most popular energy-efficient protocols for LLNs, specified in RFC 6550. In RPL, Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) control message is transmitted by a child node to pass on its reachability information to its immediate parent or root node. An attacker may exploit the insecure DAO sending mechanism of RPL to perform “DAO insider attack” by transmitting DAO multiple times. This paper shows that an aggressive DAO insider attacker can drastically degrade network performance. We propose a Lightweight Mitigation Solution for DAO insider attack, which is termed as “Li-MSD”. Li-MSD uses a blacklisting strategy to mitigate the attack and restore RPL performance, significantly. By using simulations, it is shown that Li-MSD outperforms the existing solution in the literature.}

If it brings along opportunities for entrepreneurs, there is no such thing as a theory of blockchain ventures yet. Blockchain technology drives the emergence of unprecedented types of ventures, with varying degrees of decentralization, both from an infrastructural and organizational perspective. However, there is no consistency regarding the definitions and labels used to refer to blockchain ventures. This paper proposes a definition of blockchain ventures and provides a typology distinguishing four ideal types of blockchain ventures. Our findings reveal that blockchain ventures do not inherently entail either organizational or infrastructural decentralization. They contribute to a better understanding of the diverse nature of blockchain ventures and their implications.}

A public process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private, internal business process, thus allowing a provider to reveal only relevant, non-confidential parts of its business process to its clients. Providers can change their internal business processes that may result in inconsistencies with the corresponding process views. Objective: This paper aims to develop an approach for propagating changes from an internal, private process to its public process view, such that the internal process and its process view remain consistent. Method: We develop the approach in a formal way. Definitions of process models and process views are based on BPEL, the standard language for realizing process models using state-of-the-art service-oriented technology. We validate the feasibility of the approach by showing how it can be supported by a conceptual system architecture. Results: The approach relies on two key results. First, a formal characterization of the set of private changes to an internal process, i.e., changes that do not need to be propagated to the process view. Second, a characterization of the non-private changes that can safely be propagated from an internal process to its process view such that they remain consistent. Other non-private changes result in an internal process and a process view that are not consistent. The approach is supported by a system architecture for process-based business collaboration. Conclusion: The approach supports providers in deciding if and how changes to a private, internal process propagate to its public process view such that the process view and the internal process remain consistent. The approach allows clients to monitor a public process view such that they can safely track changes made to a private, internal process.}

These issues have become critically important for economic governance in the context of climate change. Ronald Coase has proposed the most efficient market-based approach to the problem of social costs. This approach has introduced the concept of limited right to perform activities harmful to the third party and provided basis for a peer-to-peer (P2P) settlement of reciprocal damage. Decentralized P2P approach is necessary for evaluation of negative impact costs and mitigation benefits. Advance of decentralized arbitration technologies, such as Blockchain, crucially decreases transaction costs for P2P interactions and thus provides for further development of Coase paradigm. Application of Blockchain technology to mitigat collateral socio-environmental damage of economic activities relies on a concept of decentralized P2P and public evaluation of negative impact, distribution of liability, and settlement in the form of mitigation. Decentralized autonomous organization integral platform for climate initiatives (DAO IPCI) is designed to be truly decentralized public Blockchain-ecosystem and aims at creation of common business space to attract financing from investors not limited by financial capacity, location, or legal status with minimization of transaction costs, increased reliability and transparency of the whole process, which would be free of interference, interventions, manipulations, or falsifications. Although the initial objective is to provide existing markets with a “Blockchain option” or “Blockchain representation,” the goal is also to create a way for environmental markets to evolve toward truly decentralized and free personal market choice model.}

In situations where the formation of histamine in food cannot be prevented through refrigeration, diamine oxidase (DAO) enzyme may be used to degrade histamine to safe levels. The aims of this work were to apply DAO in model (buffer) and real (cooked tuna soup used in the manufacture of a fish paste product, Rihaakuru) systems, in order to obtain predictions for the rates and amounts of histamine degradation. The two systems were set up with a constant concentration of histamine (500mg/L) and the DAO enzyme (2534 units/L) at a temperature of 37°C, agitation at 100rpm and an incubation time of 10h with variable pH (5–7) and salt concentrations (1–5%). A total of 15 experiments were designed for each system using central composite design (CCD). The data from these experiments were fitted into regression models; initially the data were used to generate an exponential decline model and then the data from this were fitted into a secondary response surface model (RSM) to predict the rate and amount of histamine degradation by DAO. The model system results indicated that DAO activity was not significantly affected by salt (p>0.05), and that activity reached a maximum within the pH range of 6–6.5 with an optimum at pH 6.3. However, the results obtained with the tuna soup model showed that the optimum oxidation of histamine using DAO occurred between pH 6–7 and salt 1–3%. This study defined the conditions for the use of DAO to degrade 500mg/L of histamine in tuna soup used to manufacture Rihaakuru. The models generated could also be used to predict the rate and amount of histamine degradation in other foods that have similar characteristics to tuna soup.}

This paper performs an extensive systematic review of 153 DLT and smart contract papers specific to the design, construction and operation of built assets. The protocols and processes of a systematic review were adopted to ensure full transparency, accountability, reproducibility, and updateability of the results. Through thematic analysis, we identify eight distinct themes of applications for DLT and smart contracts in construction: information management, payments, procurement, supply chain management, regulations and compliance, construction management and delivery, dispute resolution, and technological systems. Each theme identified was analysed to understand current capabilities, applications, and future developments. A cross-themes discussion revealed that DLT and smart contracts are ‘supplementary’ technologies that are used in combination with other technologies (e.g. BIM, IoT, cloud computing) as part of ‘technological systems’ that need to co-evolve in order to enable the themes' applications identified. Research into DLT and smart contracts in construction is rapidly moving from theoretical insights and frameworks into developing proofs-of-concept studies (27 studies) and testing them in case studies (20 studies). The next stage of research involving wider academic communities and industry-wide engagement is expected to begin uncovering the anticipated benefits of DLT and smart contracts through investments into technological systems and testing in real-world pilot studies. The discussion of the themes identified from technology, policy, process, and society perspectives exposed the need for an extended socio-technical approach to the solution in order to deliver the necessary change and impact from the adoption of DLT and smart contracts at speed and scale. The results of this systematic review provide a noteworthy reference point for academics, practitioners and policy makers interested in the future development of DLT and smart contract applications in construction.}

abstract = {Smart contracts show a high potential to make supply chain management strategies epochally leap towards higher levels of productivity, not only in the functioning of production processes but also in terms of product innovation and overall economic returns. This article illustrates the principle of Income Sharing as a highly performing economic strategy for supply chains with a natural implementation in blockchain smart contracts. It proposes a blockchain-based architecture that uses smart contracts to implement various algorithmic versions of the Income Sharing principle among companies participating in a supply chain. The formation of the total income and its consequent redistribution are calculated taking into account the role of the technological platform automating these procedures, which therefore becomes a party to the inter-company business project of a supply chain in the alternative roles, as feasible in business practice, of Blockchain-as-a-Service and Blockchain-as-a-Partner. The approach is implemented on Hyperledger Fabric, the most widespread platform for private and consortium blockchains. We compare and justify this design choice with the alternative given by public blockchains, with specific attention to Ethereum.}

However, ChatGPT may generate similar responses for more general questions, irrespective of the given contract code. The tool combines both approaches to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities in Solidity-based smart contracts. The effectiveness of the tool is evaluated on real-world smart contracts, and its potential for detecting and preventing common attack vectors is demonstrated.}

To this end, we explain its potential by elaborating on how blockchain-based sharing services can help solve exploitation, data abuse, financial and legal risks, and the limited accessibility of current sharing practices. Moreover, we conduct a means–end chain analysis to provide a customer’s perspective on the motivations and fears related to blockchain-based sharing solutions. We find four motives (trust, self-determination, quality of life, and security) and two fears (mistrust and economic interest) related to blockchain-based sharing. By juxtaposing the potential benefits of blockchain-based shared services with customer insights, we provide an outline of research avenues for promoting blockchain-based sharing to overcome the current dark side of sharing practices.}

We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.}

Therefore, the need to make transactions more transparent is undoubtedly one of the main requirements of the betting industry, which promotes continuous technological development in the search for ideal solutions. This “technology” allows the creation of records that cannot be falsified. The applicability of this technology in the betting industry can be very attractive in terms of ensuring greater transparency in transactions. Furthermore, in order to decentralize the organization, it is also intended to implement a DAO governance model. This model aims to solve a centralized governance problem and, therefore, consists of governance based on the code and not on a single person/entity. In the scope of this paper, it was possible to demonstrate through a proof-of-concept solution, the applicability of Blockchain and the DAO governance model in a bookmaker. Thie solution was designed and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, using smart contracts. The results obtained in the comparison study showed that the solution is viable and presents advantages compared to traditional solutions.}

The study investigates the prospects of adopting DAO led corporate governance to manage agency (theory) problems in the light of institutional (theory) pressures. The paper depicts how algorithmic trust led corporate governance measures help any organisation follow policies, rules and regulations using DAO led corporate governance (DAOCG) framework. The authors mapped the constituents of agency theory, ethical decision-making, and institutional factors to propose the DAOCG framework. The DAOCG framework is assessed using a thematic analysis of 16 expert interviews with relevant experience from corporate governance and audit domains from varied industries across geographies. The research leveraged MAXQDA software to analyse interview transcripts and opinion codes. The framework helps to identify the core elements of DAO-led corporate governance (DAOCG) and provides the potential to study the theoretically sequenced practical constituents of corporate governance. The first-of-its-kind practical DAOCG framework can be used in the pursuits of digital transformation, business model innovation and social change.}

The study seeks to elucidate how these technologies may either hinder or exacerbate the impacts of HD on e-diasporas, characterized by their human-driven nature. The article begins with an introduction to HD, followed by a literature review on e-diasporas. Methodologically, it presents a comparative analysis of the five disruptive technologies concerning the research question and discusses their implications for e-diasporic communities, concluding with final remarks.}

Steemit is recognized as one of the earliest blockchain-based online communities, and a typical example of DAO. By endowing community members with new roles, the decentralization of blockchain-based communities brings changes to the design of user incentive mechanisms. However, few studies have paid attention to the user incentive mechanism when users play the dual roles of social participant and community owner. On the basis of social capital theory and psychological ownership theory, this study explores Steemit's incentive mechanism by evaluating the impact of these dual roles on user active participation behavior. The study adopts a two-way fixed effect negative binomial regression to test the research model. The results show that users’ social capital, share capital, social feedback, and economic feedback positively affect their active participation behavior. At the same time, social feedback and economic feedback play moderating roles on the effects of the dual capitals. Overall, this research provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for understanding, designing, and governing blockchain-based online communities.}

In this chapter we discuss the needs for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) and key efforts in this field. We then introduce a prospective solution employing blockchain Ethereum, which incorporates a Turing complete programming language with smart contract computing functionality. A solution is elaborated that permits the formation of organizations where participants preserve straight real-time check of contributed collects and governance policies are formalized, automatized and imposed using software. Basic code for smart contract is composed to make a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain. We also explain the working of DAOs code, centering on fundamental establishment and governance characteristics, which includes organization, formation and voting rights. DAOs are considered to agree to the expectation of the business work in the future. But there is still lack of operational base for DAOs in the blockchain community.}

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

Due to the innovative characteristics of decentralization, transparency, immutability, and anonymity, blockchain applications break new ground for users' decision-making in an operations environment. There is a lack of evidence regarding herding in blockchain technology in general and its potential effect on blockchain application platforms in particular. In response to this new technological phenomenon, we studied whether and how herding behaviors take place in the context of blockchain applications for operations in this research. We propose two new variables related to the operation of the blockchain application (i.e., technical assurance and decentralized management efforts) and a new variable related to user identity (i.e., identifiability). We found evidence of the existence of herding by utilizing the objective data of approximately 0.1 million transactions on a leading blockchain application platform providing self-service and collateral-based lending services. Our empirical findings also reveal that technical assurance and decentralized management efforts reduce users' herding tendencies. Moreover, we found that the higher the identifiability, the lower the users' herding tendency, and the less they are affected by technical assurance and decentralized management efforts.}

Without venturing into the wide range of governance paradigms, this research considers governance structures based on trust as a foundation for BC governance. A thematic systematic literature review is conducted to understand the literature on this topic, employing the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis) technique. An examination of 155 papers shows that using BC technology (BCT) replaces the cognitive attribution of trust in the material and human-independent code. It is also found that further research anchored to the ‘trust’ concept is required in building BC governance structures. To provide the direction in which the literature is travelling, future research questions on trust and governance are documented. In general, the literature review suggests that BC has the potential to revolutionize the way in which businesses operate. By improving transparency, efficiency, and security, BC can help businesses to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and make better decisions. This research can help policymakers, industrialists, and researchers to identify where BC governance is being used and which aspects of governance are to be focused on. This paper is a general review of literature and evidence on contemporary developmental issues.}

However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.}

abstract = {Background
Diamine Oxidase (DAO) has an essential role for degradation of exogenous histamine in the intestine; thus, histamine intolerance (HI) mainly has been correlated to a low concentration and/or activity of this enzyme. The objective of the study was to standardize a colorimetric technique to measure the enzymatic activity (function) of hDAO to then apply it to a series of 22 patients with a clinical diagnosis of HI.
Methods
For the standardization variables such as volume and type of sample, incubation time, wavelength of maximum absorption, types of substrates, and concentration of oxidized ascorbate were evaluated. Then the activity and concentration of DAO was determined in 22 patients diagnosed with HI and 22 healthy subjects.
Results
The mean of serum DAO concentration in the 22 patients was of 9.268 ± 1.124 U/mL. The mean of serum DAO concentration in the 22 controls was of 20.710 ± 2.509 U/mL, being significantly higher (P value 0.0002) the mean of the samples. The mean of serum DAO activity of the patients was of 1.143 ± 0.085 U/L and the controls was 1.533 ± 0.119 U/L, significantly greater than the patients (P value 0.011). In addition, the sensitivity of both techniques was 0.63. In the measuring of DAO concentration the specificity was 0.9, constituting a good diagnostic test, especially to rule out the true negatives. The determination of DAO activity had a specificity of 0.68.
Conclusions
Although we used a small number of patients and controls and the absorbance values were lower than expected, statistically significant differences were found in the levels of concentration and DAO activity between the patients with histamine intolerance and the controls. Therefore, the measuring of DAO concentration and DAO activity is a good diagnostic strategy for study suspect cases of HI. The simultaneous use of both assays allows to reduce positive and negative false results, for example, patients with normal DAO levels that could present a dysfunction in the activity of this enzyme.}

In particular, there are a number of three-world or triworld models in different fields and disciplines, where a complex system, a complicated issue, or an intricate concept is explained and understood in terms of three interrelated worlds, with each world enclosing a group of elements or representing a particular view. This paper examines various triadic metaphors and structures in general and three-world metaphors and conceptions in particular for building and explaining basic concepts of three-way decision. The three major objectives are (a) to formulate a TAO (Triading-Acting-Optimizing) framework of three-way decision, (b) to discuss the Dao, the Way of three-way decision, and (c) to articulate the Dao, the Way of three-world thinking. Three-world conceptions offer more insights into three-way decision with new viewpoints, methods, and modes. An emphasis of the paper is on the philosophy and the power of three-way decision for building high-level conceptual models. By using three-part structures, by focusing on only three things, or by considering three basic ingredients, we may build a theory, a model, or a method that is simple-to-understand, easy-to-remember, and practical-to-use.}

Blockchain governance has received considerable attention to ensure the safe and appropriate use and evolution of blockchain, especially after the Ethereum DAO attack in 2016. However, there are no systematic efforts to analyse existing governance solutions. To understand the state-of-the-art of blockchain governance, we conducted a systematic literature review with 37 primary studies. The extracted data from primary studies are synthesised to answer identified research questions. The study results reveal several major findings: (1) governance can improve the adaptability and upgradability of blockchain, whilst the current studies neglect broader ethical responsibilities as the objectives of blockchain governance; (2) governance is along with the development process of a blockchain platform, while ecosystem-level governance process is missing, and; (3) the responsibilities and capabilities of blockchain stakeholders are briefly discussed, whilst the decision rights, accountability, and incentives of blockchain stakeholders are still under studied. We provide actionable guidelines for academia and practitioners to use throughout the lifecycle of blockchain, and discuss future trends to support researchers in this area.}

However, these methods often involve transaction fees, potential delays, and security concerns. These methods lack transparency and traceability features, making tracking, authenticating, and verifying payments and their associated records difficult. To overcome these issues, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) based online payment system that leverages blockchain technology (BT) features and security to revolutionize financial expenses in the education sector. We also present wallet generation, fee tokenization and NFT generation processes. These processes utilize Ethereum and an interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store metadata information associated with fee payment details securely. We use Remix IDE, MetaMask wallet, and Sepolia test network to deploy and analyze the proposed system's results. We have also used the JMeter simulation toolkit to conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of throughput, latency, and response time. Our assessment identifies the increase in performance parameters with the number of users. This initiative will positively contribute towards addressing the issues of financial transactions in the education sector.}

Then, the process of decision-making for each decision making unit (DMU) can be viewed as a social behavior over multiple time periods. Using a numerical example, we demonstrate that the new DEA models can provide acceptable efficiency results with specific weights for each DMU and can describe the details of the consensus relationship among DMUs. Similar to the market mechanism in reality, the efficiency scores of DMUs within an alliance containing more than half of the participants are overestimated, at the expense of nonallied DMUs. The models in this paper provide a possible path for efficiency measurement based on decentralized decision-making principles in complex systems.}

While traditional markets use brand mechanisms to address this issue, transferring such systems to internet-based P2P markets – where misleading practices like fake ratings are rampant – remains challenging. Current internet platforms strive to counter this through verification algorithms, but these efforts find themselves in a continuous tug-of-war with counterfeit actions. Exploiting the transparency, immutability, and traceability of blockchain technology, this paper introduces a robust reputation voting system grounded in it. Unlike existing blockchain-based reputation systems, our model harnesses an intrinsically economically incentivized approach to bolster agent integrity. We optimize this model to mirror real-world user behavior, preserving the reputation system’s foundational sustainability. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, using both uniform and power-law distributions enabled by an innovative inverse transform method, we traverse a broad parameter landscape, replicating real-world complexity. The findings underscore the promise of a sustainable, transparent, and formidable reputation mechanism. Given its structure, our framework can potentially function as a universal, sustainable oracle for offchain-onchain bridging, aiding entities in perpetually cultivating their reputation. Future integration with technologies like Ring Signature and Zero Knowledge Proof could amplify the system’s privacy facets, rendering it particularly influential in the ever-evolving digital domain.}

Crisis management is another serious bottleneck due to challenges of coordinating decisions without central authorities. Informal hierarchies may also emerge—in line with organisational theoretic concept of power clawing back, which would undermine decentralization objectives. Our analysis considers anonymous reputation verification, flexibility, and transparency to have more staying power and identifies scalability as the primary obstacle—stemming from high transaction costs and throughput constraints.}

Feature selection processes were carried out to develop three distinct models, leading to a comprehensive comparative analysis. The results demonstrated that the non-linear stand-alone models (GPR, ANFIS, NN) significantly outperform the linear MVR model, with the M2 model configuration yielding the highest performance across all models. Remarkably, GPR-M2 achieved perfect model tuning with zero error rates, indicating its superior predictive capabilities. Ensemble techniques further improved performance, reflecting the experimental data's complexities in %IE modelling. The hierarchical order of performance in the training phase in the testing phase is DT-SA < MVR-SA < ANFIS-SA < NN-SA < GPR-SA. The GPR-SA ensemble emerged as the most accurate technique, substantially enhancing the predictive accuracy of the ensemble models by up to 67.73% in the training phase and 50.71% in the testing phase. These findings suggest the potential of GPR-SA in boosting the performance of ensemble approaches in material science applications. The study recommended a promising future for ML in the development and application of corrosion-inhibitors.}

Blockchain has received considerable attention recently, due to its promises of verifiable, permanent, and decentralized data handling. In 2017–2020, blockchain (and associated technologies such as smart contracts) has progressed beyond cryptocurrencies, and has been hailed as a disruptive technology for a score of industries. This study adds to the growing body of research on blockchain adoption and blockchain-driven innovation in various fields, including transport, finance, and education. However, the impact of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) on the management of science has not been systematically studied so far. This paper aims to fill the gap by studying the experience of adoption of blockchain-based solutions in academia in 2017–2020. The research is based upon a critical review of projects, relevant literature, and qualitative research: interviews (N = 24) and focus groups (N = 4) with startup founders, scholars, university executives, librarians, and IT experts from the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), Russia, and Belarus. Key challenges and barriers to blockchain adoption in academia are delineated: usability and security issues, legal concerns, conflict of values, and a critique of political dimensions of blockchain governance.}

In this way, the dream of an energy market closer to end-users becomes a reality, although, still, the regulatory framework is not clear, especially for what concerns the tokenization of assets related to investments in energy projects and energy services. The role of the blockchain technology in the energy sector has several facets: fostering Demand Response and the aggregation of loads and generators, helping the creation of energy communities and the integration of electric vehicles in the power grid, providing a more transparent and traceable relation between service providers and customers. This chapter describes current challenges and gives possible directions for the research in the field. This is done considering the possible evolutions of the regulatory framework and thus the possible implications in terms of business models. Finally, the last section of the chapter describes a possible laboratory infrastructure to test energy blockchain business models under the point of view of service providers such as grid and telecom operators, as well as the customer’s perspective.}

Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices.
