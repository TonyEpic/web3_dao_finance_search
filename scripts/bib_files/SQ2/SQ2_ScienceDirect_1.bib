abstract = {This paper introduces a novel decentralized control design procedure for an aeroelastic morphing wing. The control goal is active damping of this flexible system. The model is developed as a multi-agent system with inherent interconnections between the agents. The control system then takes advantage of the model structure and interconnections rather than relying on the entire system's model. This brings benefits, especially with a growing number of agents where the control design dimension remains low. Therefore, the proposed control design is especially suitable for morphing wings with a large number of actuation points. The result is presented in the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) form. A numerical example shows the application of the proposed algorithm.}

This paper provides an in-depth study of DAOs by analyzing their definitions, characteristics, and emerging developments. Existing definitions in the literature hardly recognize common functionalities and intermingle coded DAOs, DAO deployment platforms, and blockchain DAOs. We developed a comprehensive DAO definition by reviewing the literature and empirically analyzing 1,859 DAOs. The findings show that many DAOs were inactive and that a threshold of 20 tokenholders is a tipping point for DAOs to survive over time and maintain sustained levels of activity. Finally, based on an empirical analysis of 9,845 perceived DAOs, we identified the emerging development of off-chain voting. This emerging development challenges the autonomous nature of DAOs. We recommend further research to investigate the effect of governance structures on their long-term sustainability and viability for both on-chain and off-chain DAOs.}

abstract = {In recent years the concept of “organization” has been gradually accepted as a suitable abstraction for the development of open multi-agent systems with dynamic agents. By modelling interactions based on roles, this abstraction allows an organization to be modelled independently of its participating agents so as to support agent dynamicity. A natural requirement from the abstraction is that agents need to be “organization aware”—that is they must be able to inquire, import, and execute roles from the organization. However, how to adequately support those processes in a decentralized and dynamic environment is still an open issue. This paper addresses this problem by presenting ATALK, a novel decentralized agent middleware that fulfills the above requirements. A role component model is designed to facilitate role deployment, reflection and uniform role interaction. In order to support role dynamicity, a compositional agent architecture allowing dynamic role integration and enactment is proposed. Moreover, ATALK allows agents to hand over their role to other agents of a same organization with their run-time states. Thus, agents can dynamically relinquish their roles without jeopardizing the normal execution of the organization. This paper also evaluates our design and current prototypic implementation through both qualitative analysis and simulations. Our results show that ATALK achieves remarkable organization reconfigurability with little additional overhead.}

As the trend moves towards decentralized social networks, diverse approaches are explored, becoming crucial tools for defining trust and privacy in individuals’ personal lives during uncertain environments. Blockchain’s transformative role reaches beyond finance, revolutionizing how we establish trust and privacy in our interconnected digital societies. Concurrently, researchers recognize the efficacy of trust models in enhancing the security and reliability of social networks applications. However, a comprehensive review of recent advancements in trust models based on blockchain for social networks is lacking. To address this gap, our survey takes a comprehensive perspective on the theme of trust within decentralized networks. We examine various concepts such as the trust concept itself, trust models, trust prediction methodologies, decentralization in trust-based social networks, and the role of blockchain in fortifying trust and security in social networks. We investigate the intersection of trust and blockchain technology, encompassing concepts, types of blockchain, and their applications in social networks. These models are categorized based on different parameters, and we examine both their advantages and limitations. Finally, we propose prospective paths for researchers interested in exploring this area.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

However, on the one hand, the inability to reach mutual trust between unfamiliar entities limits the collaboration of entities, and on the other hand, most of the profits in the industrial chain are grabbed by the dominant enterprises. In this paper, an information system for collaboration among business entities is developed based on blockchain, based on which a business model called Decentralized Industry Alliance (DIA) is proposed. Transactions and profit distribution in the DIA are executed by smart contracts, which enables unfamiliar entities to trust each other without relying on a third party. Any entity that voluntarily complies with the smart contracts automatically becomes a member of the DIA, thereby promoting the expansion of the industry scale. The smart contracts distribute profits according to each entity’s contribution to the alliance, so as to ensure the fairness of value distribution. A case about the alliance of elderly care industry is carried out, which shows that the DIA achieves rapid expansion on the premise of ensuring fairness. As a general business model in the web 3.0 era, the DIA can be referenced by other industries.}

The proposed system is developed as an inference engine while having a number of interesting features. First, the system validates and audits the decision-making process while sharing and recording the input data and the computed outcomes in a synchronized trusted manner. Second, the system allows the formation of distributed AI repository that can absorb and manage concurrent use-cases while targeting different scopes and covering diverse AI branches. Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data. A case study of estimating the construction cost for road projects is provided to illustrate the system’s workability and demonstrate its performance.}

In order to preserve data privacy, data owners may choose to upload encrypted data rather than raw data to the classification services. However, these solutions adopted today for encrypted data classification not only fall short in system flexibility and scalability, but also face the single point of failure problem. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a secure decision tree classification scheme that allows decentralized authorization and access control service (SDTC-DAAC). Firstly, we propose a new framework that decouples data encryption and data computation logic to achieve the separation of data storage and computation, which significantly improves upon the flexibility and effectiveness, thus achieving cross-system compatibility requirements. Secondly, we present an end-to-end encrypted access control mechanism which enables authorized users from different parties to participate in calculations together. Finally, we further devise a scheme which serves decentralized storage service of data access control policies and access authorization without trusted intermediaries. Extensive property and performance analysis shows that SDTC-DAAC is effectiveness, as well as satisfying the security requirements for data privacy in an outsourcing environment.}

For that reason, an alternative, fully decentralised agent behaviour model was developed and compared to the hybrid one. Through simulated experiments, it was found that the decentralised agent behaviour model achieved much higher responsiveness; however, it required additional spare capacity to compensate for its decision-making imperfections.}

The path forward for truly blockchain-native financial applications, therefore, must involve the integration of real-world identity information in order to disincentivize defection. We discuss several potential technologies for doing so, and conclude that such integration is possible without compromising pseudonymity, provided real-world identity is available in the breach.}

PKI comprises digital certificates managed by the certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the user’s identity, thus providing secure communication channels. However, the security of PKI is profoundly reliant on the reliability of these third-party CAs, which serves as a single point of failure for PKI. Over the past, there have been several incidents of popular CA breaches, where the centralized operation model of CAs caused numerous targeted attacks due to the spread of rogue certificates. In this paper, we aim to make the CA pool completely decentralized and concurrently build our decentralized solution cooperative with established PKI standards (i.e., X.509) for effective real-world integration. In particular, we harness blockchain technology to propose a decentralized PKI framework named ProofChain, which provides complete trust among a decentralized group of CAs. Our proposed solution provides all the traditional X.509 PKI operations (i.e., registration, validation, verification, and revocation), making it compatible with existing PKI standards. We have also evaluated ProofChain against popular security standards (i.e., the CIA triad model) and PKI adversarial attacks. Besides, to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed system, we have also evaluated the performance of the ProofChain by implementing it on the private testbed of the Ethereum network across various real-world PKI scenarios.}

A growing body of literature has emerged exploring DAOs. However, there is a considerable lack of clarity about this organizational design and its theoretical conceptualization. To this end, we undertake an integrative literature review that reveals three main principles—decentralized, automated and autonomous organizations—and the following four theoretical perspectives mainly adopted to examine this novel organizational form: transaction cost theory, institutions for collective action, agency theory, and socio-materiality. By extending these theories, we propose an integrative model of DAO for research and theory building.

Further, a conceptual analysis of the model is made to discuss the alterations in the intelligence offerings with the enhancing implementation level of smart manufacturing systems. Based on the graphical analysis, the various level of organizational maturity with the enhancing smart manufacturing implementation is deliberated.

The result shows that environmental decentralization has a significant ‘carbon reduction effect’ and ‘pollution reduction effect’ on pig farming; it is also conducive to promoting the synergistic effect of reducing pollution and carbon emissions through supporting environmental facilities and industrial organisations. Various types of environmental decentralization have significant differences in the synergy of pollution and carbon reduction. The scale of pig breeding plays a positive regulatory role in the impact of environmental decentralization on the synergy of pollution and carbon reduction while showing regional heterogeneity. This research is crucial for advancing the green transformation of pig breeding.}

To make LMAS advantages operationally usable in an industrial context, it requires a suitable control system to connect multi-purpose assembly resources and to autonomously configure transient assembly stations. Therefore this paper reviews the relevant literature to identify the necessary components of such architectures. Depending on the control system’s intention and use cases, the properties of the organizational paradigm, an adequate ontology and basic design patterns regarding the distribution and order-relationships of the system entities are to be defined conceptually. For the implementation, a role model, an interaction model, and a data model are required. Due to the utilization of mobile multipurpose resources and the possibility of factory shopfloor reconfiguration by transient stations, existing approaches do not meet LMAS inherent properties. Consequently, we present a suitable decentralized multi-agent control system approach.}

abstract = {Today’s world is shifting slowly from centralized to decentralized nature. In the previous decade, centralized applications were in trend and used in all sectors from retail, agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. But after the introduction of Blockchain, a decentralized and distributed concept which is transparent and immutable, all possible applications are shifting towards this technology. It started with cryptocurrency, but today it is used in many applications like healthcare, retail finance, vehicular ad-hoc network, or intelligent transportation system. But the question is where it will stop? This chapter provides an answer to this question. And, it discusses all possible applications which can be decentralized and work in distributed nature. This paper gives deeper insights into various domains and aspects of technology in which Blockchain can be incorporated for further enhancement. Popular applications like decentralized web (DWeb) are discussed in this work as its major part. For providing details regarding this distributive ledger technology, we select 100 chapters (highly cited) and filtered based on requirement/application wise and provide a summary of the gist of top 50 (each) chapters. This chapter provides a detailed discussion regarding decentralized applications—Dapps (Blockchain 4.0), DWeb, and other future integration of Blockchain in other applications like Blockchain-Internet of Things integration, etc.}

abstract = {Public auditing enables data owners to entrust a third-party auditor (TPA) to perform auditing tasks periodically. To resist malicious TPAs, a plethora of blockchain-based public auditing mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot effectively mitigate single point of failure and collusion between TPAs and miners. These schemes are burdened by significant wastage of storage resources due to the presence of redundant data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized auditing scheme supporting ciphertext deduplication (BDACD). BDACD leverages a decentralized blockchain, which takes over the role traditionally played by a centralized TPA. A decentralized autonomous organization is incorporated to enhance resistance against collusion attacks. By integrating advanced ciphertext deduplication techniques, BDACD effectively mitigates storage overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept, T-Merkle hash tree, along with a corresponding search algorithm. This innovation significantly enhances blockchain storage utilization and enables efficient half-interval searches within a block. To ensure accountability and fairness, a smart contract is employed to establish an arbitration mechanism. This mechanism serves a dual purpose: penalizing any malevolent actions by cloud servers and providing adequate compensation to data owners whose data integrity has been compromised. Detailed security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate BDACD has desirable security and efficiency.}

However, empirical research in this field is still rare, and a more comprehensive understanding of the domain is a missing component in academic research. This paper develops a taxonomy based on a comprehensive literature analysis to systematically structure this emerging field. The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.}

This article adopts the regression discontinuity design (RDD) as well as stage heterogeneity influential mechanism analysis to study the nonlinear form and potential mechanisms of green investment in mitigating the ecological resource curse, based on provincial panel data of China from 2006 to 2020. The study findings indicate an inverted U-shaped curve in the linkage between green investment and pollution emission, with a turning point at 4.98. Moreover, the analysis of heterogeneity mechanisms reflects that local fiscal decentralization and resource dependence initially impede the effect of green investment on mitigating the ecological resource curse. Nonetheless, as green investment matures, the curse is primarily alleviated through substantive innovation in eco-friendly practices. By investigating the regional and resource endowment heterogeneity, it is obvious that inland and non-resource-based regions are more inclined to benefit from green investment in alleviating the environmental resource curse. Thus, this paper proposes certain policy recommendations tailored to regional characteristics, such as fostering a greener consumption mindset and minimizing industry reliance in resource-based zones.}

The intrinsic variable nature of such renewable energy sources calls for affordable energy storage solutions. This paper proposes using lifts and empty apartments in tall buildings to store energy. Lift Energy Storage Technology (LEST) is a gravitational-based storage solution. Energy is stored by lifting wet sand containers or other high-density materials, transported remotely in and out of the lift with autonomous trailer devices. The system requires empty spaces on the top and bottom of the building. An existing lift can be used to transport the containers from the lower apartments to the upper apartments to store energy and from the upper apartments to the lower apartments to generate electricity. The installed storage capacity cost is estimated at 21 to 128 USD/kWh, depending on the height of the building. LEST is particularly interesting for providing decentralized ancillary and energy storage services with daily to weekly energy storage cycles. The global potential for the technology is focused on large cities with high-rise buildings and is estimated to be around 30 to 300 GWh.}

We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.}

This work proposes a decentralized personal data management system for banking sector using block chain which makes sure that the user can control their personal data in their own .It presents a Privacy-Protected Blockchain network in which all data is encoded within a controlled time period. Despite the fact that the data is available in the past, this design can successfully preserve user privacy and protect from deceivers, providing the data more stable and healthier. Blockchain has its advantages over features such as transparency, decentralization and immutability. In the proposed model, a protocol is implemented which converts the blockchain into automated access control manager. There is no need for a third party to be trusted for the implementation of this model. In the proposed system, the transactions are not limited to financial transactions like Bitcoin, it also includes data storing, sharing and querying. Hence, the use of blockchain could reduce the overly concern about securing and compartmentalizing the data.}

Current solutions can be categorized into two types: fully decentralized autonomous systems based on blockchains or centralized solutions that rely on authoritative centers such as certification authorities (CAs). In reality, a balance needs to be struck between guaranteed authority and privacy independence. A certain authority is needed as an authorization guarantee, and decentralization is required to ensure privacy and the independence of the authority. This paper proposes a novel scheme, CT-MA-ABE (Cross-Trust Multiple Authorization Attribute-Based Encryption), to address these issues by implementing MA-ABE for cross-border institutional authorization interactions, utilize blockchain certification authority (BCA) for credibility and encryption-based authorization to protect attribute data privacy. This solution integrates the role of 'notary' in cross-border interactions, addressing the supervision problem in fully decentralized approaches while also considering the trust issue in centralized systems. This paper also introduces the Universal Certificate Authority Pool (UCAP), an innovative hybrid federated authorization method, creatively utilizing the implied authorization conditions of attributes to create a flexible and transitive authorization mechanism based on attribute relationships and extensions, enhancing privacy protection and improving the speed of authorization matrix calculation. The successful deployment of the system between the legal jurisdictions in South China, Zhuhai and Macau as a critical infrastructure component for securing data interactions further demonstrates its effectiveness as a reliable and secure solution.}

Three themes emerge from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) voting structure, (2) proposal management, and (3) token management. Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose. However, the operations and methods implemented are more oriented toward agency viewpoints due to their reliance on incentive-based processing and are based on a lack of trust among DAO stakeholders.

However, scheduling TSCH transmissions in the time and frequency dimensions is left to implementers. A plethora of TSCH schedulers are proposed in the literature and are developed either in a centralized or a decentralized fashion. Our work aims at giving an overview of the most relevant decentralized TSCH schedulers which we classified into : autonomous, distributed, and Reinforcement Learning based protocols. Then, an evaluation of a selection of these schedulers is carried out in a scenario considering highly heterogeneous traffic, i.e, considering the coexistence of very high and very low data rates in the network. These traffic conditions can be faced in current and future IoT applications, especially surveillance applications. Based on the experiment results, a set of conclusions is drawn for each of the considered schedulers to gain insights into their relevance for applications that need to handle highly heterogeneous traffic.}

Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs) in Ghana, a form of forest decentralization, is a relatively recent government strategy to reduce forest loss, promote restoration, and improve local control and participation in resource management. This paper examines the powers devolved to CREMAs in Ghana, using a political ecology lens. Using a variety of qualitative research methods, the paper found that CREMAs receive limited powers from the State and these powers mainly restrict local access to resources, an action the State has often failed at. The results also suggest that CREMAs impose responsibility on local people without accompanying resources and often at the expense of security and safety of local volunteer enforcers. The findings also highlight the lack of coherence between forest decentralization and exiting political decentralization processes; the incoherence between the different institutional regulations for CREMAs; and tensions between new and traditional forms of local resource governance. The study suggests that critical approaches to evaluating the performance of decentralized regimes could be a useful approach to understanding the drivers of vulnerability among local resource users, dependents, and their institutions.}

Virtual power plants (VPPs) have emerged as an important paradigm for aggregating and managing numerous DERs. This paper proposes a decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) multilayer energy trading framework to facilitate optimized coordination of DERs within a VPP context. A control center, prosumers, and service operators constitute the model’s multi-layered architecture. Profits from feed-in tariffs, ancillary services, and P2P sales are optimized for revenue while expenses are minimized using a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Smart contracts enable prosumers to trade energy units in the Ethereum blockchain with ease via a participatory web platform. The effectiveness of the framework in synchronizing power supply and demand within the VPP by coordinating the charging and discharging of storage systems in accordance with consumption patterns is demonstrated through performance evaluation. In contrast to conventional centralized architectures, the proposed framework utilized decentralized architecture efficiently consolidates and optimizes distributed energy resources (DERs) to improve grid stability and renewable energy utilization.}

The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge/cloud computing, 5G networks, big data analytics, and other emerging technologies in IoT systems is leading to the emergence of Smart Systems that support devices to make autonomous decisions in order to improve and facilitate people’s lives. These smart IoT devices produce a huge amount of sensitive data. Thus, establishing Trust between these devices is vital to ensure the security of the sensed data and for the normal functionality of smart systems. To address these challenges, several Trust establishment protocols have been proposed, but they have some limitations such as centralization, the need for human intervention, and the lack of adaptability to smart devices with computation and storage constraints. In this paper, a decentralized trust establishment protocol is proposed for smart IoT devices and is applicable for different scenarios. The protocol provides decentralized identity management, mutual authentication, access control, and secure communication by combining Blockchain technology with PV-SAS-MCA message cross-authentication protocol based on Short Authenticated Strings (SAS). To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to propose a new approach that uses Blockchain as an extra distributed and authenticated channel to exchange Short Authenticated Strings without physical interaction. This helps to allow entities in the Smart IoT environment not only to identify each other but also to exchange their public keys in a secure manner. Moreover, the proposed protocol uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure communications with significantly smaller key sizes and lower computation overhead. Experimental results reveal that the time required to complete the authentication process is less than 90 ms which is a superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art decentralized authentication mechanisms.}

The strategy has been tested and validated on two different platforms: the inter-UAV communication performance is evaluated on NS-3 simulator to measure metrices such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, delay, and routing overhead within the UAV swarms, while mission efficiency and fault tolerance is analyzed on robot operating system framework, and visualized on Gazebo simulator with real-time parameters. Through experimental results, we show that, after proper tuning of control parameters, the approach succeeds in flock formation with high level of fault tolerance, offering higher efficiency in terms of mission time, transmission delay, packet delivery rate, and control overhead, when compared to the benchmark approaches.}

The LDRs model is then reformulated as a computationally tractable solution such that the proposed adjustable robust extension of decentralized operation can handle renewable energy uncertainty while reducing the computation burden of decentralized optimization. Then, a tailored fast alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm with a predictor–corrector type acceleration step is developed to improve the convergence rate of decentralized optimization.

abstract = {Decentralized decision-making can be represented as a connected decision network of agents collaboratively optimizing their local objective functions over common coupling constraints. In this setting, solving large-scale mathematical programming centrally is undesirable or impossible because the data storage and decision authority are already decentralized, the communication bandwidth for information exchange is limited, and privacy concerns with information may exist. We introduce a taxonomy of mathematical programming-based decentralized optimization problems and decentralized algorithms based on the degree of information sharing, information exchange and existence of a central coordinator. We synthesize the literature and identify the shortcomings of a decentralized algorithm, the trends, and the potential research directions based on the proposed taxonomy.}

abstract = {The role of prosumers who are consumers who produce, store, and consume energy is vital to the uptake of renewable energies in Local Energy Communities (LEC). However, the integration of prosumers in the smart grid to facilitate bidirectional flows of energy and information depends on intelligent operations of energy systems and flexible structures of the existing energy markets. But existing energy trading mechanisms are faced with issues of trust, privacy, security, and energy pricing determination. Also, there are fewer studies based on a citizen-centric prosumer approach. Thus, there is need to provide reliable solutions that addresses the aforementioned challenges faced by prosumers in LEC. Advancements in disruptive technologies, such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed a broad spectrum of intelligent systems in smart cities. Therefore, this study examines the integration of AI and IoT as AIoT and DLT towards a citizen-centric prosumer approach for decentralized energy markets trading. Additionally, this article develops an architectural model for energy prosumption in LEC using design science approach based on a user-centred design method that shows a possible implementation concept to support energy sharing and trading in LEC. The architectural model supports trust, data privacy, security, and energy pricing determination using AI and smart contracts to provides real-time energy trading monitoring, easy access, control, and immutable logs to unearth underlying energy demand and supply patterns thereby supporting citizen-centric prosumer approach. Finally, a use case scenario of DLT and AIoT for prosumption operations is presented.}

abstract = {Traditionally, exams were scheduled into designated timeslots within a centralized campus. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted this practice, forcing universities to prioritize the safety of individuals during exams. In response, a shift to online assessments occurred, bringing forth new challenges such as academic dishonesty and inadequate infrastructure. This study presents a novel approach to decentralized in-person exams for geographically dispersed students. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed, followed by a mixed-integer linear reformulation, to optimally determine the scheduling of exams, test center locations, and student allocation, while addressing the incorporation of both hard and soft constraints. Given the complexity of the problem, we have implemented meta-heuristic algorithms to solve larger instances, including genetic and simulated-annealing algorithms. Additionally, we have devised a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of population-based and local-search algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we used real data collected from our department during the fall semester of 2022. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the hybrid algorithm compared to others, in terms of both effectiveness and adaptability. It remains consistent across different scenarios, effectively addressing real-world complexities. Finally, a comparison between centralized and decentralized scenarios underscores the advantages of the latter approach during the pandemic.}

While previous literature on project delivery models identifies the use of decentralized governance, there is not yet a holistic conceptualization nor a specific overview of governance applications that can be applied. To develop the concept, we use a literature review to synthesize fourteen blockchain governance mechanisms useful for managing the crypto-commons. Subsequently, we use systematic combining to identify twenty-two specific applications for decentralized project delivery in the construction industry, one of the largest project-based industries. Each application is briefly reviewed, and examples of their relevance to realize decentralized project delivery models are provided. We discuss the potential for novel forms of project delivery, but also the need for future research on the applications, as well as on the system level implications, the system design challenges, and the implementation barriers in the specific context of the construction industry. Overall, the concepts and mechanisms presented provide a theoretical foundation upon which future researchers can use to design novel decentralized project delivery models.}

abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.}

The advent of the digital era has facilitated the development of a plethora of digital participatory platforms that could presumably help to boost the effective engagement of civic communities in decision making processes in an explicitly decentralized manner and, more so, the demand for such decentralized e-participation services is increasing during the current Covid-19 crisis. However, there is a real shortage of studies that directly focus on the analysis of such autonomous cases and all the more so from real life contexts in their natural settings. In this regard, this paper aims to fill the gap by analyzing the phenomena from an intrinsically peer-to-peer networking perspective, which could be observed today in popular autonomous civic engagement initiatives that have been launched in recent times in the area.}

However, scheduling TSCH communications in the time and frequency dimensions has been left open to researchers since it is tightly coupled with the application requirements. A wide range of TSCH schedulers has been proposed in the literature either in a centralized or decentralized fashion. Our work aims at evaluating a selection of decentralized schedulers including distributed, autonomous and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) based ones in a scenario that considers heterogeneous traffic conditions with very high and very low data rates simultaneously. Based on the experiment results, conclusions are drawn for each scheduler to gain insight into their energy efficiency and network performance with respect to applications that must handle highly heterogeneous traffic.}

Blockchain technology could act as a social innovation to overcome issues in decentralised governance, and rural areas could even prove to be a fertile environment for future innovation. In this conceptual paper, the potential of blockchain technology is theoretically positioned in regional development discourses. After exploring how blockchain could be applied to rural governance and the barriers it needs to overcome to reach mass adoption, a new distributed model of governance is suggested.}

We provide empirical evidence that open standards and blockchain-based governance are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a decentralized and neutral platform. Centralization and concentrated voting power may lead to dependencies, rent extraction behavior and create hold-up problems. Consequently, producers, prosumers and service providers must evaluate the governance structure of the platform before establishing a presence.}

The control scheme is designed for implementation in a modular controller architecture, where a collection of subcontrollers is employed, with each subcontroller being associated with a subsystem that represents a component of the vibrating structure. Each subcontroller uses state feedback from adjacent subsystem sensors to perform vibration suppression and energy harvesting using a switching control law. Furthermore, the assumption is made that neighbouring subcontrollers exchange information collaboratively to estimate the effects of coupling forces, achieving control efficiency comparable to that of a centralized approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a modular suspension platform equipped with semi-active dampers and electromagnetic energy harvesters. The approach is evaluated under various free vibration scenarios, encompassing faulty measurement conditions, and is compared to passive and heuristic state-feedback control strategies. The results confirm that the proposed method attains a superior control performance, independent of the degree of decentralization in the adopted controller architecture, rendering it a viable solution for addressing large-scale semi-active control problems.}

However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.}

The Bisq Trade Protocol systematises the peer-to-peer trading of Bitcoin for other currencies and the Bisq DAO decentralises the governance and finance functions of the entire exchange. However, by following the Bisq Trade Protocol and interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use novel address clustering heuristics to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We describe address clustering heuristics for both the Bisq Trade Protocol and the Bisq DAO. We show that the heuristics aggregate activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.}

abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.}

Blockchain technology drives the emergence of unprecedented types of ventures, with varying degrees of decentralization, both from an infrastructural and organizational perspective. However, there is no consistency regarding the definitions and labels used to refer to blockchain ventures. This paper proposes a definition of blockchain ventures and provides a typology distinguishing four ideal types of blockchain ventures. Our findings reveal that blockchain ventures do not inherently entail either organizational or infrastructural decentralization. They contribute to a better understanding of the diverse nature of blockchain ventures and their implications.}

With the rapid development of the mobile Internet of Things, the fastest way for users to access the evaluation system is through mobile devices. However, this also poses security challenges to the traditional professional title evaluation system. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized and security-enhanced digital title evaluation system in mobile IoT. Since the system uses blockchain to implement a decentralized review process, the transparency and fairness of the review process are guaranteed. At the same time, the review data and reviewer information in the system are encrypted and stored in the distributed network to ensure the security and non-tamperability of the data. All review records are recorded on the blockchain, and anyone can view and verify the legitimacy of the review results. Additionally, the system incorporates security enhancement mechanisms such as identity verification, smart contracts, and auditing functions to improve the credibility of the evaluation process and prevent cheating under mobile IoT. Experiments have shown that this system has important application value in the field of professional title review in universities, which can improve review efficiency, reduce human intervention, and provide strong support for the credibility of review results.}

In line with this, subnational government authorities were created at the local level to ensure effective local government administration. Against this backdrop, this study investigated the challenges hindering the active participation of the citizenry in local governance in the Ketu South Municipality of the Volta Region of Ghana. A qualitative research design was adopted. The study purposively selected thirty-five (35) participants in the study area for the purposes of its primary data collection through interviews. This study investigated the fact that citizens were expected to participate in local governance through community engagement forums, budgeting, and financial planning, medium-term development planning, preparation of annual action plans, and participation in district level elections. The results of the study showed that low participation of the citizenry in local government is attributable to citizens’ lack of information and education on the need for local-level participation, inadequate political structures of the Metropolitan Municipal and District Assemblies, and inadequate resources at the local government level. To ensure and promote the active participation of the citizenry at the local level, there is the need to educate the citizenry, and ensure that there are adequate and sufficient resources at the local level.}

abstract = {Implementation of blockchain is quickly finding popularity in several real-world applications. As a result, in order to execute and process smart contracts, blockchains frequently necessitate integrating them with real-world data from various sources or employing third-party services. Through hybrid smart contracts, Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) make it possible for on-chain code to communicate with off-chain infrastructure and services, assisting in the realisation of this vision. Although the blockchain itself is a secure ecosystem, its reliance on external services and real-world data exposes it to security risks. These dangers reveal themselves in improper smart contract execution as a result of malevolent actors manipulating data from outside sources. Therefore, it is necessary to design a Zero Trust Architecture to provide end-to-end security for DON-based applications. The idea of Proxy Smart Contracts (PSC), which offers a one-level indirection to the execution of the actual smart contracts, is introduced in this article. Prior to the actual smart contract execution, the PSC hypothetically runs the smart contract logic and displays the result state to the interested parties for their approval. Thus, inconsistent end states can be identified and the smart contract’s actual execution can be stopped. Solidity is used in the initial implementation to show that the suggested strategy is workable. The current work is significant since it presents a potential remedy to overcome this crucial gap that can limit widespread acceptance of dApps-based use-cases in the real world.}

However, when the required sensing becomes spatio-temporally large and varying, a collective arrangement of sensing tasks to a large number of battery-restricted and distributed drones is challenging. To address this problem, this paper introduces a scalable and energy-aware model for planning and coordination of spatio-temporal sensing. The coordination model is built upon a decentralized multi-agent collective learning algorithm (EPOS) to ensure scalability, resilience, and flexibility that existing approaches lack of. Experimental results illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results contribute a deeper understanding of how coordinated mobility of drones influences sensing performance. This novel coordination solution is applied to traffic monitoring using real-world data to demonstrate a 46.45% more accurate and 2.88% more efficient detection of vehicles as the number of drones become a scarce resource.}

In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control. At 20 CASVs, 6Blocks achieves an edge-service latency of 0.05ms against 0.76ms, 0.27, and 0.15ms for cloud, edge, and SDN-edge schemes, respectively, with high connection density of 107 nodes, at maximum utilized IPFS bandwidth of 0.2 Mbps. Then, we validate the trust of our model through the automated validation of the internet security protocol and applications (AVISPA) tool and modeled the vehicle and sensor nodes. The obtained results show the efficacy of the proposed scheme against existing state-of-the-art approaches with respect to parameters such as network, security, transaction costs, and auction.}

Using a Smart Contract-driven workflow coupled with a commitment scheme and a differential privacy-based solution, we ensure training integrity, prevent plagiarism, and protect against leakage of sensitive data while performing effective federated training. We demonstrate the system’s effectiveness by performing simulation and implementation of an end-to-end proof of concept. Our practical implementation showcases the system’s efficiency on a single computer with multiple trainers, revealing low memory demands and manageable network and block I/O, which suggest scalability to larger, more complex networks. The paper concludes by exploring future enhancements, including advanced cryptographic methods for enhanced privacy and potential applications extending the system’s utility to broader domains within FL.

In this work, we highlight how technological logic of separation understood in the framework of decentralization can address manipulation concerns. As a first step, we devise a reference model of electronic marketplaces, containing six functional components, and outline how control over these components enables different manipulative practices by gatekeepers. We identify two dimensions of decentralization that can counterbalance monopolistic abuse of marketplace components.

In practice, many ferry terminals are subject to geographical and environmental conditions, limited space resources of the terminal pool, and restricted navigable waters of ships, which leads to constrained operations and increases the difficulty of docking when multiple ferries enter and depart from the terminal. Because of the distributed, real-time and dynamic characteristics of multi-ferry maneuvering, this paper proposes a decentralized, time-optimal control strategy to coordinate the maneuvering of multiple entering and departing ferries in restricted terminals. It combines nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) with an iterative learning control (ILC) framework. Based on the states and maneuver data of previously successfully performed trajectories, the coupled constraints among multiple ferries are decomposed with support vector machine (SVM). Therefore, it also does not require real-time information exchange during ferry operations and has the merits of low communication demand, as only local information is required in each ferry controller. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Environmental decentralization can help local governments strengthen their independence and make better use of the advantages of environmental information to curb the occurrence of environmental emergencies, but regional corruption significantly weakens its effectiveness. Therefore, based on panel data of China's 30 provincial administrative regions between 2005 and 2016, this paper applies the panel threshold model to explore the relationship between environmental emergencies, environmental decentralization, and regional corruption. The results indicate that, first, environmental decentralization, environmental administrative decentralization, environmental monitoring decentralization, and environmental supervision decentralization all have a negative influence on environmental emergencies; second, as the degree of corruption in a region increases, the effect of environmental decentralization on restraining environmental emergencies decreases; and finally, there is heterogeneity in the relationship between environmental emergencies and environmental decentralization in various regions. Environmental decentralization in the eastern and western regions negatively affects environmental emergencies, while there is a positive relationship between the two in the central region.}

It includes a physical simulation of static obstacles, dynamic obstacles with scriptable movement, soil condition, active jammers, static and dynamic link obstacles with configurable damping as well as thermal noise. The simulated ground based mobile robots use CPBP [12] as probabilistic model predictive closed loop controller in combination with gradient free cost functions to evaluate complex unsteady goodness aggregations. The goal of this approach is the development of connection aware swarm behavior for complex missions such as terrain exploration, formations, convoy escorting or creation of a mobile ad hoc network in dynamic disaster areas under realistic environmental conditions. The missions can be combined in any manner and the target extraction of the high-level commands for each agent is done implicitly. To validate the developed behavior, the independent software control kernel is able to be used on real robots as well.}

Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.}

Therefore, the need to make transactions more transparent is undoubtedly one of the main requirements of the betting industry, which promotes continuous technological development in the search for ideal solutions. This “technology” allows the creation of records that cannot be falsified. The applicability of this technology in the betting industry can be very attractive in terms of ensuring greater transparency in transactions. Furthermore, in order to decentralize the organization, it is also intended to implement a DAO governance model. This model aims to solve a centralized governance problem and, therefore, consists of governance based on the code and not on a single person/entity. In the scope of this paper, it was possible to demonstrate through a proof-of-concept solution, the applicability of Blockchain and the DAO governance model in a bookmaker. Thie solution was designed and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, using smart contracts. The results obtained in the comparison study showed that the solution is viable and presents advantages compared to traditional solutions.}

Overcoming these hurdles requires innovative solutions that can bridge the gap between current capabilities and future needs. Swarm electrification emerges as a promising concept that could accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 7 goals by leveraging the collective power of decentralized energy resources. This paper presents a literature review on swarm electrification and related insights from case studies. The study delves into the concept of swarm electrification, placing it within the context of the prevailing trends in the power system sector: decentralization, decarbonization, and digitalization. It examines the role of digital technologies in enhancing swarm electrification and categorizes application areas according to the phases of swarm electrification. Particular attention is given to the technologies underpinning Deep Digitalization, such as distributed ledger technology, notably blockchain, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on machine learning. These technologies play pivotal roles in advancing swarm electrification. The review demonstrates how deep digitalization can facilitate the improvement of swarm electrification and ultimately support the integration of bottom-up initiatives with top-down grid expansion efforts over time.}

In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to optimize the scheduling of home-controlled appliances, minimize overall electricity costs of the community, and prioritize participants' privacy by integrating non-cooperative energy game theory under time-of-use (TOU) tariffs and incentive schemes. The proposed Segmentation Based Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (SBD-ADMM) is a novel algorithm that efficiently addresses the social welfare and participants' privacy problem in a decentralized distribution of power. It introduces a communication-efficient approach to optimize power trading while maximizing collective welfare, without relying on a central hub or authority. Node coloring is used in the formulation of the algorithm, in which every node just needs to trade with its neighbors in order to attain the entire optimum solutions. The suggested P2P trading algorithm is assessed on a broad range of scenarios, demonstrating its efficiency as well as fast convergence. The P2P trading algorithm provides similar optimum results with considerably a lesser number of communications and iterations as compared to other contemporary decentralized techniques. The suggested strategies for DR program and P2P trading are more feasible and privacy-preserving compared to other modern strategies. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that demand response and P2P trading can reduce overall costs for consumers by up to 30.23 % and for prosumers by up to 44.34 %.}

Due to ecological susceptibility and resource scarcity, exploring the core factors of resource consumption is critical for designing an effective climate policy. Manifestly, fiscal decentralization has an enormous potential to pursue sustainable development. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of fiscal decentralization and ecological policy stringency on consumption-based resource footprint (RF) in resource-intensive countries from 1990 to 2019. It applies a cross-section augmented distributive lag estimator in resolving the issues of cross-section dependency and slope heterogeneity. The study's long and short-run outcomes reveal that revenue decentralization and environmental governance significantly reduce RF. However, the contradictory results are examined by expenditure decentralization, which promotes RF. Moreover, strict environmental regulations moderate the positive influence of expenditure decentralization, implying that the resource-decoupling effect of expenditure decentralization on RF is reduced when the countries are embodied with effective environmental governance systems. Similarly, the alternative methods endorsed identical findings, and this study offers valuable policy suggestions to strengthen the environmental protection system and formulate sound ecological policies for efficient resource utilization under the decentralization framework.}

The DAOCG framework is assessed using a thematic analysis of 16 expert interviews with relevant experience from corporate governance and audit domains from varied industries across geographies. The research leveraged MAXQDA software to analyse interview transcripts and opinion codes. The framework helps to identify the core elements of DAO-led corporate governance (DAOCG) and provides the potential to study the theoretically sequenced practical constituents of corporate governance. The first-of-its-kind practical DAOCG framework can be used in the pursuits of digital transformation, business model innovation and social change.}

The findings show that local councils have little administrative discretion and decision space over human resources, financial management, and service delivery. The study calls for a comprehensive review of decentralization policies and local government legislation to address the allocation of powers and decision space of the institutional capacity of local councils to provide local services. Their roles and responsibilities should also be specified in the national constitution to safeguard them from the encroaching “directive culture” of central government officials.}

We then introduce a prospective solution employing blockchain Ethereum, which incorporates a Turing complete programming language with smart contract computing functionality. A solution is elaborated that permits the formation of organizations where participants preserve straight real-time check of contributed collects and governance policies are formalized, automatized and imposed using software. Basic code for smart contract is composed to make a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain. We also explain the working of DAOs code, centering on fundamental establishment and governance characteristics, which includes organization, formation and voting rights. DAOs are considered to agree to the expectation of the business work in the future. But there is still lack of operational base for DAOs in the blockchain community.}

Moreover, ideal segmentation with a large scale participation is another economic issue in terms of allocation of total profit among aggregators. In this context, this study proposes a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market incorporating Multi-agent System (MAS) which consists different three agents with variable power levels. In the MAS environment, while Agent-1 represents a community which has variable household number according to the case studies, Agent-2 is an independent aggregator who is not included in, and does not influence the transactions of the Agent-1. Finally, Agent-3 is the ENKA Insaat ve Sanayi A.S. which has office buildings equipped with electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and photovoltaic (PV) panels. In the paper, all the agents simultaneously solve their own sub-problems by distributed way according to the received dynamic price signals along with the availability of the responsive demands. Moreover, 132 case studies consisting of low, medium, and large scale with different prosumer penetration are created in order to obtain optimal grouping strategy. The obtained results indicate that the group formation under middle penetrations gives the highest cost reductions, and the total cost reductions of Agent-1 and Agent-3 are 24.9% and 13.14%, respectively, while the total profit of Agent-2 is 4.53$ according to the best solution.}

Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization.

The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

Moreover, drivers and passengers are charged with different services fees by the electric mobility service provider. The emergence of emerging technologies such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can foster trust, boost electric car-pooling business models. Hence, DLT is utilized to store electric car-pooling trips, drivers, and passengers’ information to ensure user privacy and maintain security. Similarly, social practice theories such as Community of Practice (CoP) is progressively considered as a significant structure within societies as it aids the development and sharing of resources across groups. But very little attention has been devoted to examined how CoP can be employed to support the design of decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling. Leveraging CoP and DLT, this paper proposes a decentralized community of practice-based model that enables drivers to publish electric car-pooling services and passengers to be matched to a driver without depending on a trusted third party. A systematic literature review was adopted to collect data and a case study of a decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling was presented. Findings from this study highlights conceptualization of CoP for improving decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling and provide insights on efficient decentralized mechanisms for electric car-pooling. Theoretically, this article identifies the current problems, state-of-the-art of decentralized electric car-pooling. For policy implications this study provides guidelines to effectively govern and manage the development of on-demand electric car-pooling for sustainable public transportation.}

Addressing this challenge, we introduce a pioneering decentralized path planning model, DPPDRL, built upon the foundations of deep reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from human path planning and dynamic coupling techniques, DPPDRL imbues AGVs with the autonomy to independently dictate and dynamically adapt their paths in real time. Notably, DPPDRL champions the adoption of diverse policies, thereby facilitating efficient collision avoidance and exploration of potential routes. Simulation-based evidence substantiates critical findings, including remarkable improvements in training speed and scalability, heightened adaptability to environmental variations and agent number changes, and applicability across any number of AGVs, provided a reasonable task distribution. However, DPPDRL's performance becomes limited when tasks are densely concentrated. Addressing this issue through task distribution and hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising direction for future research. These findings underscore the transformative potential of DPPDRL in managing extensive, dynamic AGV operations.}

However, DCL faces significant challenges in ensuring its trustworthiness, as data isolation and privacy issues make DCL systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks that aim to breach system confidentiality, undermine learning reliability or violate data privacy. Therefore, it is crucial to design DCL in a trustworthy manner, with a focus on security, robustness, and privacy. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of existing efforts for designing trustworthy DCL systems from the three key aformentioned aspects: security, robustness, and privacy.

abstract = {In the digital economy, the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is paramount. Despite the deployment of various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in industrial CPSs, the primary obstacles to the advanced research include class imbalance, privacy gap, model homogenization, and arbitrary aggregation. Thus, in this paper, a Permissioned Blockchain-enabled decentralized federated distillation Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), namely PB-fdGAN, is proposed for Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) in industrial CPSs. The novel Local Differential Privacy (LDP)-external classifier GAN (ecGAN) addresses class imbalance and privacy concerns by integrating label conditions into the latent space and using Wasserstein distance for stability in semi-supervised learning. Additionally, a Decentralized Federated Distillation (DFD) scheme allows for collaborative model building without data exchange, enhancing privacy and diversity. Moreover, a Quality of Service (QoS)-consortium blockchain framework with a new QoS evaluation strategy ensures reliable and effective model aggregation. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the high effectiveness of PB-fdGAN in detecting various types of cyber threats and the superiorities over state-of-the-art IDS solutions.}

We construct a set of decentralized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models based on the basic decentralized decision mode of “votingmajority”, and we consider the assumptions that DMUs have no prior information about other DMUs’ decisions, and that they do. Then, the process of decision-making for each decision making unit (DMU) can be viewed as a social behavior over multiple time periods. Using a numerical example, we demonstrate that the new DEA models can provide acceptable efficiency results with specific weights for each DMU and can describe the details of the consensus relationship among DMUs. Similar to the market mechanism in reality, the efficiency scores of DMUs within an alliance containing more than half of the participants are overestimated, at the expense of nonallied DMUs. The models in this paper provide a possible path for efficiency measurement based on decentralized decision-making principles in complex systems.}

To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-to-end example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented.}

abstract = {Decentralized (parent-affiliates) business groups encompass independent firms sharing production resources under common administrative or financial control. Due to the complexity of integrated decision-making, business groups often delegate pricing and technology decisions to separated units. With the growing prevalence of transfer technology in multi-plant operations, there arises a demand for modeling frameworks capturing the joint impact of transfer prices and technology on affiliates’ production. In this paper, we propose an operational methodology to integrate transfer prices and technology, as incentive mechanisms driving affiliates’ production decisions. This consists of a single-leader-multi-follower game where a parent firm (the leader) operates in a single-product market and delegates production to profit-maximizing affiliate firms (the followers). In addition to providing data-driven support for integrated decision-making, our framework reveals how managerial structures respond to the growing significance of intangible technology. In this line, based on the parent’s control of the value chain we present two specifications and solution approaches: full delegation and partial delegation. For the former, we provide an exact characterization of the equilibrium solution; whereas for business groups operating under full delegation, we provide tight lower and upper bounds, computable by state-of-the-art optimization solvers. Our empirical tests rely on a customized version of the Orbis data set. Figures show that our methodology not only integrates the substitutability between transfer prices and technology, as well as their dependency on the parent’s control of the value chain, but also gives rise to a flexible computational approach that is applicable to a wide range of decentralized business groups.}

abstract = {Increasing the penetration of variable and uncertain renewables and electric vehicles in power systems may give rise to problems (such as network congestion and commitment mismatches) if not controlled strategically. This demands control solutions in the form of energy management strategies for active distribution networks which would control the connected distributed energy resources and storage units in real-time to address the mentioned challenges. Centralized strategies may fail to serve this purpose for large-scale distribution networks due to their inherent shortcomings like vulnerability to single point of failures and large computing times. Unlike centralized approaches, decentralized control strategies show more potential. This paper presents one such solution, based on an adaptive multi-agent system, to control a large-scale distribution network in real-time. Its performance is compared with the results obtained with the corresponding centralized optimization problem, modeled as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Both the centralized version and the decentralized multi-agent version of the problem under consideration are presented and a case study is designed for the comparison. The comparison shows that the designed multi-agent system produces a near-optimal solution in real-time while the centralized optimization strategy struggles in terms of computational complexities for larger distribution networks. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we study a new decentralized multi-project time-cost tradeoff problem, called MPTCTP-D, where project scheduling and resource allocation decisions are made in a distributed way by autonomous project managers to optimize their local objective, subject to a global available budget for all the projects. We show and prove the existence of price of anarchy as the difference between the optimal objective value of MPTCTP-D and its centralized counterpart. A multi-agent based cooperative approach with negotiation protocol is proposed to mitigate resource competition of autonomous local decisions and achieve a reasonable allocation of resource for global decision-maker, with both exact and local-search based heuristic algorithms developed. Our exact algorithm is able to find optimal solutions and prove optimality for instances with up to five projects and 120 activities per project. The hybrid randomized and 2-opt improvement algorithm is able to efficiently find optimal solutions to small instances and significantly better solutions than other heuristics alone for instances with up to 20 projects and 120 activities per project. Managerial insights on the optimal solutions and the price of anarchy are obtained and discussed.}

abstract = {The paper focuses on hierarchically structured organisations with a large set of operating units. While the central body in such organisations faces asymmetry of information concerning the operating costs of the units, it may wish to incentivise them through benchmarking and target setting to operate as efficiently as possible. If a standard Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach is used for this purpose, each operating unit could estimate its own efficient targets. However, this decentralised scenario is not necessarily appropriate for a centralised organisation in which a central body wishes to optimise the performance of the system of units as a whole. On the other hand, a top-down imposed set of targets is often not suitable as they would be too demanding for some units and too lax for others. This paper proposes a DEA-based approach for incentivising the units of a hierarchically structured organisation in order to optimise the performance of the units collectively while at the same time the targets are not too demanding for inefficient units. The proposed approach is also extended so that incentive levels for operating units are determined over time, taking into account any changes in their productivity. Accordingly, the central management can strike a balance between not spending too much on incentives on the one hand and encouraging the operating units to reveal their true cost function on the other. We illustrate our approach using data from a set of German savings banks.}

By virtue of the multi-agent system theory, this paper presents an organizational architecture for fractionated spacecraft, which not only enables autonomous cluster operations but also facilitates its non-traditional attributes. Within this organizational architecture, a decentralized framework is proposed to solve cluster reconfiguration problems based on primal and dual decomposition, where subgradient methods are adopted to include reconfiguration cases with non-differentiable objectives. Two typical constraints are considered: final configuration constraints representing coupling variables and collision avoidance constraints representing coupling constraints, both of which are non-convex. General schemes are proposed to convexify those constraints via the linearization and convex restriction technology. Then final configuration constraints are tackled by primal decomposition, while collision avoidance constraints by dual decomposition. To the end, multi-level primal and dual decompositions are employed to solve reconfiguration problems with both coupling variables and coupling constraints. For illustration an example of in-plane cluster reconfiguration is solved and compared with the centralized approach the solution is optimal.}

This paper proposes a computational framework leveraging dynamic multi-agent networks to conceptualize, model, and quantify multi-agent, decentralized recovery process building upon strategic network formation methods. This innovative approach addresses limitations in conventional strategic network formation models by accounting for the fluidity of structural shifts induced by the strategic behaviors of individual agents, and by acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity within agent populations. The central objective of this study is to highlight the critical role of bottom-up recovery and present a systematic, adaptable framework for modeling these processes in diverse real-world scenarios. We achieve this through four key elements: modeling post-disruption responses, exploring their interdependencies, accommodating multiple equilibria, and generating metrics for scenario comparison and forecasting. Our dynamic strategic network formation model offers valuable insights into crucial trade-offs in decentralized recovery processes and facilitates the integration of both bottom-up and top-down resilience strategies. Furthermore, it could serve as a predictive tool informing initial network architectural decisions by estimating likely post-disruption equilibrium states based on the initial network structure. Ultimately, this study provides a robust platform for analyzing network efficiency and resilience trade-offs, setting the stage for more informed decision-making in complex sociotechnical systems.}

Usage control is often coupled with information flow control to monitor how data are propagated. While usage control is well established and modeled in centralized systems, the literature has only partially addressed usage control for distributed systems, for instance by distributing the usage control system components. However, when it comes to assigning policy to certain data, it is always enforced by a central authority. This paper proposes an extended usage control model to integrate decentralized information flow control (DIFC), which enables users to decide collectively which policy to apply to their common data. Functions to handle connection status aspects are also considered, for dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) or peer-to-peer networks where parts of the distributed network can be disconnected. Architectural aspects and formal definitions to enable decentralized policies for shared data are proposed as a novelty, resulting from the integration of DIFC. We used the TLA+ formal specification language on the proposed model and its attached model checker TLC to detect potential issues. We detected potential deadlocks due to the new connection functions as well as temporal ordering issues then suggested mitigations accordingly. A privacy analysis is provided using a car-sharing scenario to highlight the benefits of usage control.}

abstract = {Decentralization is a central characteristic of biological motor control that allows for fast responses relying on local sensory information. In contrast, the current trend of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches to motor control follows a centralized paradigm using a single, holistic controller that has to untangle the whole input information space. This motivates to ask whether decentralization as seen in biological control architectures might also be beneficial for embodied sensori-motor control systems when using DRL. To answer this question, we provide an analysis and comparison of eight control architectures for adaptive locomotion that were derived for a four-legged agent, but with their degree of decentralization varying systematically between the extremes of fully centralized and fully decentralized. Our comparison shows that learning speed is significantly enhanced in distributed architectures—while still reaching the same high performance level of centralized architectures—due to smaller search spaces and local costs providing more focused information for learning. Second, we find an increased robustness of the learning process in the decentralized cases—it is less demanding to hyperparameter selection and less prone to becoming trapped in poor local minima. Finally, when examining generalization to uneven terrains—not used during training—we find best performance for an intermediate architecture that is decentralized, but integrates only local information from both neighboring legs. Together, these findings demonstrate beneficial effects of distributing control into decentralized units and relying on local information. This appears as a promising approach towards more robust DRL and better generalization towards adaptive behavior.}

Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices.

In this paper, we propose NodeMaps, a data processing framework to capture, analyse, and visualise data from several popular P2P blockchain platforms, such as Cosmos, Stellar, Bitcoin, and Lightning Network. We compare and contrast the geographic distribution, the hosting provider diversity, and the software client variance in each of these platforms. Through our comparative analysis of node data, we found that Bitcoin and its Lightning Network Layer 2 protocol are widely decentralised P2P blockchain platforms, with the largest geographical reach and a high proportion of nodes operating on The Onion Router (TOR) privacy-focused network. Cosmos and Stellar blockchains have reduced node participation, with nodes predominantly operating in large cloud providers or well-known data centres.}
