abstract = {Previous indoor positioning research has mainly been focused on using Wi-Fi and RFID. In recent years, researchers began to study using Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor positioning purposes. In general, positioning techniques based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), such as signal propagation and fingerprint, are commonly used in wireless/mobile networks. These techniques have certain limitations and tradeoff in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation and practical application/deployment. For example, both methods require a training process before deployment. In this paper, we present a decentralized BLE-based positioning protocol that does not require training before deployment. The training process can automatically be done on the fly by the anchor nodes. While the anchor nodes are broadcasting, they also scan for signals emitted by other anchors. This collaborative communication process exchanges location information and signal strength measurements between each anchor. This process builds a signal-to-distance reference list for the target node to estimate physical distance in a more accurate way. Experimentation in a real indoor environment shows that the proposed collaborative positioning method can achieve an error of 1.5 meters on average. This is generally applicable for most indoor positioning applications for locating people. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical, because it does not require training before positioning estimation and is adaptive to environmental changes.}

Question: Will (can) a multi-agent system, as a whole, achieve efficient resource allocations, when each agent makes independent decisions, adjusted by feedback of its own viability measure to maximize its own goal based on limited information about the entire system?

In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions—transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement—, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.}

The optimal solution can be used as a reference for tracking control and it guarantees that a speed-dependent safety constraint is satisfied both at the MP and everywhere within a Control Zone (CZ) which precedes it. We analyze the case of no active constraints and prove that under certain conditions the safety and speed constraints remain inactive, thus significantly simplifying the determination of an explicit decentralized solution. When these conditions do not apply, a complete solution is still obtained which includes all possible constraints becoming active. Our analysis allows us to study the tradeoff between the two objective function components (travel time and energy within the CZ). Simulation examples are provided to compare the performance of the optimal controller to a baseline consisting of human-driven vehicles with results showing improvements in both metrics.}

Revenues and costs should be allocated over the decentral units and decentralized data capture and processing of the diagnosis and treatment of any patient.

However, establishing such a network-wide calibration is typically a time-consuming task and requires user interaction. In this paper we present a decentralized and resource-aware algorithm for estimating the poses of all network nodes without any user interaction. This self-calibration of the network is achieved in two steps: First, overlapping camera pairs estimate relative positions and orientations by exchanging locally measured distances and angles to detected objects. Second, calibration information of overlapping cameras is spread throughout the network such that poses of non-overlapping cameras can also be estimated. Our approach does not rely on a priori topological information and delivers the extrinsic camera parameters with respect to a common coordinate system. In a simulation study we analyze the performance of our approach concerning the achieved spatial accuracy and computational effort considering noisy measurements and different communication schemes.}

We explored the links between software as a service (SaaS) and organizational agility by conducting two stages of interviews with key informants in large organizations, and by employing affordance and inertia-theoretical lenses. Two basic affordances emerged from the retroductive data analysis – implementing quickly and sourcing independently – which in turn yielded two higher-level affordances: trialing alternatives and self-organizing business teams. We developed a model that explains how and why these four affordances enhance agility by accelerating the sensing-to-acting process of organizations. We also describe how five categories of organizational inertia in IT units hinder agility. Our main contribution is how adopting SaaS applications enables organizational agility while highlighting the role of IT unit inertia in SaaS affordance actualization processes.}

Unlike the economic literature on decentralisation that is dominated by normative and prescriptive arguments on how a shift towards decentralisation should take place, this paper makes a case for re-centering of the political in the decentralisation literature. This political study of decentralisation does not prescribe decentralisation rules, but weighs the different social, economic and ecological outcomes under varied local conditions. It takes note of the diversity of local institutions and politics in the interpretation of formal rules, power relations, legal rights, moral claims, social custom, and the establishment of informal institutional arrangements. This is done in the context of questioning the typologies of neat property regimes that are broadly categorised as – open-access, state, private and common property - in the economic literature. These widely accepted typologies are tested at the local level and it is found that ownership does not necessarily refer to control and use of resources. The paper highlights the heterogeneity of property regimes under which the village communities manage the forests, and points out that specific state-society relations in particular villages determine the entitlements of the villagers. Importantly, the nature of collective action on decentralisation and negotiation of institutional design has an impact on the consequences at the local level. As the local reality is based on varied local resources, institutions, political processes and social capital, uniform national or state policies have very different local outcomes. This paper asks if it is possible to evolve policies that incorporate diverse institutional arrangements with a combination of different kinds of property rights under decentralised local governance management.}

This paper presents a communications architecture for scalable selective data dissemination in wireless sensor networks which is comprised of a decentralised data distribution layer that is tightly coupled to a reliable gradient-based routing protocol. The system supports mechanisms for selective data pushing and pulling within the sensornet where unstructured Peer-to-Peer content distribution concepts are utilised to fairly distribute pieces of data amongst an overlay of consumer and producer nodes. The system has been evaluated under a variety of network conditions and scenarios, both via simulation and real-world deployment, and it is shown to be reliable, scalable, and capable of distributing data in a fair and efficient manner across the network.}

abstract = {Good governance has been clearly identified as a priority for deep disaster vulnerability reduction and resilience-building. In particular, decentralisation has been lauded as a mechanism to democratise risk management decision-making, by redistributing power across scales in favour of local actors. However, in practice, decentralised risk management frameworks have often been critiqued for being incomplete and exclusionary. This paper argues that the politics of scale offers a neglected yet highly valuable framework to understand the construction of limits to decentred power and agency, which cause these apparent gaps between decentralisation as ideology, policy and practice. Scale theory offers this by providing an insight into the dynamics which define where power is located within risk governance regimes, and why. With reference to a case study of Jamaica’s decentralised disaster management system, the paper illustrates the processes through which scaled risk governance systems can be used, distorted, and shaped by their constituent actors. The analysis identifies three processes of incomplete decentralisation, scale-jumping, and scalar disconnect, as being responsible for the reinforcement of a state-centric power asymmetry within the national disaster management system and the stripping of local agency. Hence, these processes are highlighted as fundamental barriers to the aspirations of a framework that claims decentralisation as a normative goal. The conclusions drawn in this paper are significant for critical geographers and policy-makers interested in the conditions for equitable and effective risk governance policy, and who view local leadership as being necessary for long-term vulnerability reduction.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to the decentralized Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problem. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of decentralized localization using low-density maps built with low-cost sensors. This problem is challenging at different levels. Indeed, each vehicle localization tends to drift over time independently of one another making the global localization of a fleet hard to achieve. To counter this effect, called SLAM inconsistency and which has been stated numerous times in the literature, we introduce a model to represent the natural drift of SLAM algorithms. Its integration inside an Extended Kalman Filter is explained along with simulations validating its use. The second part of this paper presents the fusion architecture designed to solve the different problems arising in a decentralized scheme. It avoids data incest, which is an important source of inconsistency, and integrates the previously mentioned SLAM drift in the estimates produced. This architecture also separates the SLAM classically used for mono-vehicle applications from the high-level decentralized part offering flexibility regarding sensors and algorithms at a low-level. Other aspects, involved by the multi-vehicle settings, are also taken into account (communication losses, latencies, desynchronizations, unknown initial positions of the fleet members and data association). The whole algorithm has been tested in various scenarios with vehicles equipped with a single camera and an odometer. The results, from both simulated and real scenarios, show that our approach can work in real time with very small bandwidth requirements.}

However, a prevalent issue is the ad hoc adoption of SIPs without a cohesive strategy, resulting in isolated solutions that do not effectively enhance core organisational functions. Our research fills this critical gap by identifying and combining the capabilities and barriers posed by SIPs. Our findings allow us to propose a framework comprising the stages each main organisational function needs to develop to move from a traditional to a completely autonomous decision-making function. This evolutional path requires that each organisational function acquires selected capabilities and overcomes specific barriers. Our approach encompasses a multi-method methodology, commencing with a systematic literature review (SLR) encompassing 44 papers, leading to the identification of 20 capabilities and 23 barriers. Subsequently, through rigorous content analyses and expert interviews, we formulate the framework. This paper contributes to academia by providing a framework with an evolutional path that main organisational functions may follow according to the capability they acquire from the SIP and which barriers should be surpassed at each level. For managers in practice, the proposed framework enables a better understanding of the stage of their operations and which capabilities will take their main organisational function from traditional (level 0) to autonomous (level 3) stages.}

However, if control and instrumentation engineers understand the static and dynamic characteristics of a plant, it is not so difficult to design a fully automatic control system for that plant. Nevertheless, the behavior of a biochemical or chemical production plant is not easily measured and understood. If a plant in an organization does not perform a vital role or does not require very accurate control, a relatively simple control system, i.e. only to maintain the plant at its current state or prevent it from moving into abnormal states, may be sufficient from the point of view of reducing the operative personnel. In the present paper, a decentralized autonomous system based on recent computer technology is proposed for such a purpose. Furthermore, a common objective function—the `Happiness Index'—is introduced. The novel concept has been applied onto and tested for an example bioprocess case by simulation.}

In this paper we assess the institutional and environmental impacts of forest decentralization in Bolivia, Kenya, Mexico, and Uganda. We develop theories of institutional impacts based upon the specific content of decentralization reforms. We classify each country’s reforms in terms of the creation/change in local user group empowerment and accountability mechanisms. Using data from the International Forestry Resources and Institutions Program, we estimate the effects of forest decentralization on local forest investments, rulemaking, wealth inequality, and forest conditions in the four countries. Some results support our theory, but the theory is insufficient to explain the full range of outcomes.}

First, decentralized activation in wireless sensor networks is investigated using the theory of global games. Given a large number of sensors which can operate in either an energy-efficient “low-resolution” monitoring mode, or a more costly “high-resolution” mode, the problem of computing and executing a strategy for mode selection is formulated as a global game with diverse utilities and noise conditions. We formulate Bayes–Nash equilibrium conditions for which a simple threshold strategy is competitively optimal for each sensor, and propose a scheme for decentralized threshold computation. The second class of results we consider is in a non-Bayesian context where sensors deploy simple adaptive filtering algorithms and the global behavior converges to the set of correlated equilibria.}

The presented system builds on three contributions: a flexible tree-based policy model that allows delegation of policy definition, a job prioritization algorithm based on local enforcement of distributed fairshare policies, and a decentralized architecture for non-intrusive integration with existing scheduling systems. The system supports organization of users in virtual organizations and divides usage policies into local and global policy components that are defined by resource owners and virtual organizations. The architecture realization is presented in detail along with an evaluation of the system behavior in an emulated environment. In the evaluation, convergence noise types (mechanisms counteracting policy allocation convergence) are characterized and quantified, and the system is demonstrated to meet scheduling objectives and perform scalably under realistic operating conditions.}

abstract = {The impacts of climate change and decreasing local resources are increasingly threatening the resilience and sustainable management of urban areas and infrastructures worldwide. To cope with such threads and vulnerabilities, urban sustainability and resilience oriented plans have been developed. Accordingly, policy makers need to learn how to properly integrate urban sustainability with urban resilience principles and practices in the re-shaping of urban agendas. In order to highlight the future potential of integrating transformative resilience principles into the general sustainability approach, this paper provides a critical review of a recent and successful urban regeneration and development plan, the “Mexico City Green Plan”. This paper also discusses a feasibility study for urban redevelopment and transition towards resilience in Mexico City, in order to illustrate the necessity and potential of urban resilience for the improvement of the life prospects of disadvantaged inhabitant groups. The Valle del Chalco neighborhood in Mexico City is presented as an example, whereby resilient and sustainable urban transformation was achieved through an integrated and sustainable decentralized water management and infrastructure plan. In practice, the terms ‘Sustainability’ and ‘Resilience’ can be exploited to justify conventional, non-sustainable urban development practices. The results discussed in this paper demonstrate the necessity of the integration of transformative resilience principles within sustainable urban redevelopment and regeneration. The main findings are i) Policy makers underestimate the potential of urban resilience in shaping more sustainable urban futures, since they only understand resilience as the flipside of specific vulnerabilities, ii) The building of urban resilience within sustainable urban transitions and redevelopment can effectively foster people empowerment, particularly in combination with the decentralization of resources management systems, and iii) The main challenge for the implementation and execution of transitions processes towards urban resilience and sustainability is the elimination of political barriers.}

In this paper, we build a self-organized decentralized OSN (SDOSN) on the overlay network of an IoT infrastructure resembling real life social graph. A user model based on homophily features is proposed considering social relationships and user interests and focuses on the key OSN functionality of efficient information dissemination. A swarm intelligence search method is also proposed to facilitate adaptive forwarding and effective service discovery.

The economic crisis that has led to a fiscal crisis in many countries has had controversial impact in the global economy. For instance, many local and regional governments are trapped between increased needs of citizens, growing demographic pressures, and minimal financial resources. Taking into consideration that local governments’ financial strength is always below that of national governments, the challenges faced are severe. However, this study recognises that local governments cannot always avoid significant budget reductions. The study also recognises that innovative ways of organising public services, aiming at reducing overhead costs, and preserving, as far as possible, the level and quality of services provided to citizens and communities need to be taken into consideration. The study argues that, successful change also depends on good planning and consultation even though this incurs up-front costs of transition. Moreover, good quality investments for local economic development for instance provide employment and help meet other economic, environmental and social objectives. The findings reveal that, trade related activities at local levels could be instrumental in facilitating economic growth and fighting economic crisis.}

The determination of a beneficial solution, i.e., a respective contract in terms of a common schedule, is particularly difficult due to information asymmetry and self-interested behavior of the involved agents. The agents intend to minimize their individual costs that consist of tardiness cost and their share of the machine operating cost. The aim of this study is to find socially beneficial outcomes by means of negotiation mechanisms that comply with decentralized information and conflicting interests. For this purpose, we present an automated negotiation protocol, which is inspired by metaheuristics, along with a set of optional building blocks. In the protocol, new solutions are iteratively generated, as mutations of a single provisional contract, and proposed to the agents, while feasible rules with quotas restrict the acceptance decisions of the agents. The computational experiments show that the protocol—without central information and subject to strategic behavior—can achieve high quality solutions which are very close to results from centralized multi-criteria procedures. Particular building block configurations yield improved outcomes. Concluding, the considered scheduling problem enhances standard scheduling models by incorporating multiple stakeholders, nonlinear cost functions, and machine operating cost, whereas the presented negotiation approach contributes to the methodology and practice of collaborative decision making.}

In this paper, we propose a Blockchain leveraged decentralized eHealth architecture which comprises three layers: (1) The Sensing layer – Body Area Sensor Networks include medical sensors typically on or in a patient body transmitting data to a smartphone. (2) The NEAR processing layer – Edge Networks consist of devices at one hop from data sensing IoT devices. (3) The FAR processing layer – Core Networks comprise Cloud or other high computing servers). A Patient Agent (PA) software replicated on the three layers processes medical data to ensure reliable, secure and private communication. The PA executes a lightweight Blockchain consensus mechanism and utilizes a Blockchain leveraged task-offloading algorithm to ensure patient’s privacy while outsourcing tasks. Performance analysis of the decentralized eHealth architecture has been conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the system in the processing and storage of RPM data.}

In this work we address different methodologies for this purpose and give reasons for adopting the adaptive capacities wheel developed by Gupta et al. [1] as the basic way for this evaluation. We add an additional dimension to those already developed by Gupta for determining the capacity of a community for having basic services (health, communications, safety, etc.) in a situation of crisis caused by climatic changes. A climatic crisis generally affects the conventional energy infra-structure and therefore decentralized renewable energies would reduce vulnerability of the community in question.

abstract = {Decentralized drinking-water systems are an important element in the process of reaching the Millennium Development Goals, as centralized systems are often deficient or non-existent in developing and transition countries (DC and TC). Most water-quality problems are due to hygiene factors and pathogens. A range of decentralized systems is available to counter these problems, including thermal and/or UV methods, physical removal and chemical treatment. This review focuses on decentralized systems that treat the potable water (drinking and cooking) of a single household (point-of-use systems) or a community (small-scale systems). For application in DC and TC, important boundary conditions for decentralized systems include low costs, ease of use, sustainability, low maintenance and independence of utilities (energy sources). Although some low-cost systems are available, their application is limited by time-consuming daily operation and maintenance. Other systems are too expensive for the poor populations of DC and TC and in most cases do not fulfill the system requirements described above. Point-of-use systems based on membranes are commercially available and are designed to operate on tap pressure or gravity. Membrane systems are attractive since they provide an absolute barrier for pathogens and remove turbidity, thus increasing the palatability of the water. The costs of membrane have decreased rapidly during the last decades and therefore membrane systems have also become within reach for application in low-cost applications in DC and TC. Some membrane systems rely on gravity as a driving force, thereby avoiding the use of pumps and electricity. On the basis of the present literature data, no small-scale systems could be identified which meet all the requirements for successful implementation. Furthermore, in the available literature the performance of highly fouling water types has not been reported. For such cases, more extensive studies are required and a need for suitable pre-treatment was identified. It can be concluded that there are good prospects for decentralized systems based on membranes, but that a need exists for research and development of systems with low costs and low maintenance, specifically designed for DC and TC.}

However, decentralization requires the creation of new institutions on the ground, to stimulate an environment enabling stakeholder participation and integration into the water management decision-making process. In 1991, Mozambique began restructuring its water sector toward operational decentralized water resources management. Within this context of decentralization, new legal and institutional frameworks have been created, e.g., Regional Water Administrations (RWAs) and River Basin Committees. This paper identifies and analyzes the key institutional challenges and opportunities of DWRM implementation in Mozambique. The paper uses a critical social science research methodology for in-depth analysis of the roots of the constraining factors for the implementation of DWRM. The results obtained suggest that RWAs should be designed considering the specific geographic and infrastructural conditions of their jurisdictional areas and that priorities should be selected in their institutional capacity building strategies that match local realities. Furthermore, the results also indicate that RWAs have enjoyed limited support from basin stakeholders, mainly in basins with less hydraulic infrastructure, in securing water availability for their users and minimizing the effect of climate variability.}

Considering the high uncertainties of renewable energy sources and load demands, robust optimization-based distributed framework exhibits a prospective application on networked multi-microgrids in the future. By integrating analytical target cascading and robust model which can be solved using a column-and-constraint generation method, the robust economic dispatch problem can be applied in different entities, respectively, distribution network operator and microgrid operator in a decentralized way. Second way, column-and-constraint generation algorithm can be naturally realized in a decentralized and coordinated manner, specifically, the sub-problems and master-problem can be separately executed in microgrid operators and distribution network operator. Decentralized framework can respect the independence and privacy of different operators, and be beneficial to solve technical and economic challenges brought by centralized optimization. Numerical results of a modified IEEE 33-bus test distribution system with three microgrids validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and compare the characteristics of two kinds of decentralized implementations, and it is found that the first methodology shows better information privacy and lower communication burden, while the second way can obtain quicker convergence speed. In addition, cost comparison between cooperative case and three kinds of uncooperative cases is analyzed to explain economic benefits of cooperative operation. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of lateral uncertainty and longitudinal uncertainty are given to show that robustness is enhanced at the expense of adding costs.}

Decentralization has then been considered as the panacea to privacy issues, especially in the realms of OSNs.

Moreover, research on Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) has shown that there are more challenges to their realization that need proper attention and more innovative technical solutions. In this paper, we discuss the issues related to privacy preservation between centralization and decentralization, and we provide a review of available research work on decentralized privacy preserving services for social networks.}

However, few schemes consider both fairness and copyright protection in the current literature. In this paper, we propose a flexible and Ethereum-based scheme to facilitate copyright protection in data sharing blockchain, by using watermark-based policies. This allows us to achieve properties such as preventing the re-selling of data (e.g., partial data, combined data, and leaked data). We also design five algorithms to automatically guarantee data sharing fairness and proactively protect data copyright, by using smart contracts. In other words, several new security features are introduced to existing transaction schemes, while still achieving feasible performance. The response times for each key step of smart contract in the proposed scheme is between 0.41 s and 0.91 s.}

This was the beginning of the World Wide Web as we see it today. From humble beginnings, the Internet has become a necessity in everyday life rather than an experimental venture. However, the shape that this giant has taken leaves a lot to be desired from the perspective of those propagating “Freedom of the Internet,” “Net Neutrality,” and “Freedom of Expression.” The biggest reason cited is that typically people do not own their data today. It is stored, analyzed, and used by big conglomerates like Google and Facebook. Every time a user interacts on the net, copies of his/her data are created and travel across the web, and the more such copies, the more one loses control of his/her data. This is not just an inefficient manner of execution but also a privacy concern. Almost three decades into the development and the internet is still hinged on the client-server architecture.

Specifically, an individual vehicle is controlled only by its local noisy information measured from a local sensor in order to follow the average behavior (mean field) of the entire population while achieving the overall optimal control performance. We solve the partially-observed linear-quadratic mean field game to obtain decentralized optimal controls for two-wheeled vehicles. These controls are decentralized since they are functions of the local estimated state from the local Kalman filter. We show that the set of the decentralized optimal controls constitutes an ϵ-Nash equilibrium, where ϵ converges to zero as the number of vehicles becomes large. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through simulations and experiments with various operation scenarios for a large population of two-wheeled vehicles.}

In the current study, we examine transitions theory and its implications for the progress of decentralized energy systems in Japan in the period after the Fukushima accident of 2011. Empirical data from a targeted nation-wide survey is used to examine the progress and change in consumer preference and behavior since the disaster, as possible evidence for the potential transition paths likely to be occurring. Importantly, this study utilizes data that examines a spectrum of urban–rural and disaster–non-disaster areas in order to explore whether any differences in response patterns were present. Results indicate that although the desire of stakeholders has been to change the energy system, there are barriers to transformation. Variation between rural and urban sites and between disaster-affected and unaffected areas was examined, indicating that (at least under the chosen classification) there was surprisingly little difference. The results have implications for understanding transitions at a much broader level, and imply that, if the empirical data is a useful indicator, Japan is within a locked-in or reorganization transition. In order to move to a more radical conversion type change a new approach is likely to be required to nurture niche innovations effectively.}

abstract = {Today’s supply networks consist of a certain amount of logistics objects that are enabled to interact with each other and to decide autonomously upon their next steps; in other words, they exhibit a certain degree of autonomous cooperation. Therefore, modern logistics research regards them as complex adaptive logistics systems. In order to analyze evolving dynamics and underlying implications for the respective systems’ behavior as well as the potential outcomes resulting from the interaction between autonomous decision-making “smart parts”, we propose in this contribution a fully solvable stylized model. We consider a population of homogeneous, autonomous interacting agents traveling on R with a given velocity that is itself corrupted by White Gaussian Noise. Based on real time observations of the positions of his neighbors, each agent is allowed to adapt his traveling velocity. These agent interactions are restricted to neighboring entities confined in finite spatial clusters (i.e. we have range-limited interactions). In the limit of a large population of neighboring agents, a mean-field dynamics can be derived and, for small interaction range, the resulting dynamics coincides with the exactly solvable Burgers’ nonlinear field equation. Explicit Burgers’ solution enables to explicitly appreciate the emergent structure due to the local and individual agent interactions. In particular, for strongly interactive regimes in the present model, the resulting spatial distribution of agents converges to a shock wave pattern. To compare performances of centralized versus decentralized organization, we assign cost functions incurred when velocity adaptations are triggered either by multi-agent interactions or by central control. The multi-agent cumulative costs are then compared with the costs that would be incurred by implementing an effective optimal central controller able, for a given time horizon, to reproduce an identical spatial probability distribution of agents. The resulting optimal control problem can be solved exactly and the corresponding costs can be expressed as the Kullback–Leibler relative entropy between the free and the controlled probability measures. This enables one to conclude that for time horizons shorter than a critical value, multi-agent interactions generate smaller cumulative costs than an optimal effective central controller.}

The arbitrary arrival and serving rates of tasks on peers impedes the high throughput in large-scale P2P Grids. We propose a novel autonomous resource allocation scheme, which can maximize the throughput of self-organizing P2P Grid systems. Our design possesses three key features: (1) high adaptability to dynamic environment by proactive and convex-optimal estimation of nodes’ volatile states; (2) minimized task migration conflict probability (upper bound can be limited to 2%) of over-utilized nodes individually shifting surplus loads; (3) a load-status conscious gossip protocol for optimizing distributed resource discovery effect. Based on a real-life user’s workload and capacity distribution, the simulation results show that our approach could get significantly improved throughput with 23.6–47.1% reduction on unprocessed workload compared to other methods. We also observe high scalability of our solution under dynamic peer-churning situations.}

abstract = {The idea of creation of more decentralized power system has been circulating for a while, but started to materialise only during the recent years, when massive introduction of support schemes for RES has started to move more and more generation into the distribution network. Apart from the environmental benefits, this has created several challenges for planning and operation of the conventional power system. Furthermore, the growing recognition of necessity for optimization across different energy carriers for example “ETIP SNET Vision 2050” is also pointing towards more and more decentralized system. This chapter presents an overview of the main architectures and concepts for smart decentralized energy systems, through the critical analysis of recent documents such as Pan-European roadmaps (ETIP-SNET) and scenarios (TYNDP2020), results of R&D projects and regulatory documents (“Clean Energy for all Europeans”). The chapter is organized in four parts and starts with background for decentralization: driving forces, trends, and foreseen benefits as well as potential challenges and pitfalls. The second section starts with an overview of different levels of decentralization. The decentralized architecture combined with new ICT infrastructure (including machine learning), opens possibility for new and more efficient control approaches (balancing and voltage). This issue has been studied for example in ELECTRA IRP project, elaborating a cellular structure with dedicated set of novel controls for the power system. This section will further look at the market alternatives and the areas with several unresolved issues and gaps, which must be explored further and require an immediate attention from the research community. The following section will present views of several key stakeholders on decentralization of the power system. It appears that transformation to partially or fully decentralized power system will require certain changes of the present and creation of new roles and responsibilities among actors on the power market. Some of these modifications has been already introduced and formalised in the most recent recast of “Clean Energy for all Europeans.” The section will further present somewhat different opinions about this among the involved stakeholders, which have been expressed in several position papers. The final section makes conclusions and links the content to other chapters of the book.}

Today most Grids adopt a centralized or hierarchical model for their information system, but this model is characterized by poor scalability, resiliency and load-balancing features. Nowadays the research and development community is heading towards the use of scalable information systems based on distributed models such as the decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) model and the super-peer model. If the former is adopted, each node can act both as a client and a server as it can generate discovery requests and also respond to requests issued by other peers. Requests and responses are forwarded with a hop-by-hop mechanism by ad hoc Grid Services hosted by Grid nodes. The super-peer model is a recently proposed approach that combines features of centralized and P2P models. A super-peer acts as a server for a single Grid organization, and publishes metadata describing the resources provided by the nodes of that organization. At the same time, super-peers connect to each other to form a P2P network at a higher level. This paper analyzes information systems based on three alternative models: the hierarchical, the decentralized P2P, and the super-peer model. A performance evaluation of such models is reported, and afterwards a performance comparison is discussed in order to analyze the pros and cons of each solution.}

The response of the US Department of Homeland security, as set forth by the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) is to decentralize much of the risk assessment and strategic decision-making processes to the owners and operators of the critical infrastructure. Although, this decentralization method has many advantages, it may provide a solution that is inferior to a comprehensive centralized approach. This manuscript develops a multi-objective strategic preparedness problem that is constrained by distinctive model features of an interdependent, regional socio-economic system. The model is a generalization of the nation’s critical infrastructure protection problem that focuses on commodity transaction between economic sectors. The strategic preparedness problem is solved by various decomposition methods, to illustrate the complexity of a decentralized risk management process of a system that is pregnant with interdependencies. The Inoperability Input–Output Model is core to the preparedness problem of this manuscript, and provides a rich database and modeling paradigm to support the study of regional interdependent economies. Derived from a Nobel Prize-winning W. Leontief economic model, and built on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, the IIM is a quick, inexpensive, holistic method for estimating economic impacts and sector interdependencies. The IIM is useful as a part of a larger multi-objective decision model used in this paper to analyze the process of decentralized strategic preparedness. This paper develops a general ability to quantify system trade-offs between objectives of preparedness decisions, by embedding the IIM into a multi-objective risk management model for strategic preparedness. Through decomposition of the multi-objective strategic preparedness model constructed around the IIM, we analytically calculate the trade-offs between preparedness costs and economic resilience of regions from existing regional economic data, and provide insights into the decentralized risk management process.}

The emergence of business models can affect the design of tariffs, but at the same time, tariff design can trigger new business models as they can nudge adoption towards certain technologies. Network tariffs have traditionally been established using a cost accounting method. Due to its cost structure, network tariffs are second best constructs, as marginal cost pricing does not lead to cost recovery. Second best solutions, in all probability, will overcompensate some inputs which in turn will be overused (the Averch-Johnson effect). New distributed energy technologies that perform better in these overcompensated inputs will therefore see a higher penetration in the market. Penetration of some technologies over others in a previously monolithic vertically integrated power sector will open up new customer needs and therefore business opportunities. Each resulting business opportunity would make use of the grid differently from which it was originally conceived, and at one extreme, they can bypass it altogether. We provide a framework of analysis that leads to the pricing of the services provided by the electricity grid for each new business opportunity.}

Our hexarotor is modeled based on the quaternion framework to resolve singularity of the rotation matrix represented by Euler angles, and has 6-DoF due to six tilted propellers, which allows to control its translation and attitude simultaneously. In our problem setup, the leader hexarotor is coupled with the follower hexarotors through the followers’ average behavior (mean field), and the followers are coupled with each other through their average behavior and the leader’s arbitrary control. By using the mean field Stackelberg game framework, we obtain a set of decentralized optimal controls for the leader and N follower hexarotors when N is arbitrarily large, where each control is a function of its local information. We show that the corresponding decentralized optimal controls constitute an ϵ-Stackelberg equilibrium for the leader and N followers, where ϵ → 0 as N → ∞. Through simulations with two different operating scenarios, we show that the leader–follower hexarotors follow their desired position and attitude references, and the followers are controlled by the leader while effectively tracking their approximated average behavior. Furthermore, we show the nonsingularity and 6-DoF control performance of the leader–follower hexarotor group due to the novel modeling technique of the hexarotor presented in the paper.}

The dual quaternion algebra is used to model the agents’ poses and also in the distributed control laws, making the proposed technique easily applicable to time-varying formation control of general robotic systems. The proposed pose consensus protocol has guaranteed convergence when the interaction among the agents is represented by directed graphs with directed spanning trees, which is a more general result when compared to the literature on formation control. In order to illustrate the proposed pose consensus protocol and its extension to the problem of formation control, we present a numerical simulation with a large number of free-flying agents and also an application of cooperative manipulation by using real mobile manipulators.}

The FRM combines semantic mapping management and authority management technologies to help solve several of the general management problems that are encountered whenever organisations enter into capability sharing agreements. An overview of related work on federation and the technical underpinnings of our approach are discussed and our work’s particular relevance to real world problems is explained through two service-centric use cases which involve the end-to-end delivery of a multimedia stream to a user’s home across several independent operators.

The proposed approach relies on an existing two-phase optimization framework, whereby prosumers optimize first their self-generation and household consumption, which are subsequently coordinated by the aggregator via incentives through the solution of a mixed-integer linear program. As a distinctive aspect, the notion of fairness in the distribution of incentives among prosumers is incorporated through new nonlinear constraints based on the Shapley Value while respecting standard demand response requirements. A mathematical approximation, which is proven to be exact under certain practical assumptions, is proposed to accommodate the new constraints into the linear model. Furthermore, a novel solution methodology, which combines the divide-and-conquer principle and Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition, is devised to tackle the resulting problem in a distributed fashion. For validation purposes, the behavior of the linear approximations is examined by comparing the results with those attained with their nonlinear counterparts. Moreover, scenarios for prosumers featuring different flexibility levels are generated to assess the practicality of the assumptions adopted. Simulations also show the scalability of the proposed tool by considering cases with up to 10,000 prosumers with computing times within an hour if distributed computing is implemented. Furthermore, as compared to classical Shapley Value approaches, a similar distribution of incentives is attained by the new solution methodology with relative less and acceptable computational effort. Finally, the impact of the new constraints on Peak-to-Average Ratio is quantified, obtaining an increment of up to 13.2% with respect to cases disregarding fairness.}

In distributed RTS, similar ideas have led to the adoption of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components integrated via Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles and technologies that are already well-established in business-oriented information systems. However, current SOA technologies for orchestration, such as Enterprise Service Busses, do not meet strict time-dependent constraints on scalability and latency required by RTS. We present a novel approach to RTS development where the orchestration of real-time processes is decentralised among the services within a fully distributed rule-driven process framework. Our framework wraps around COTS components implementing individual processing steps in a decentralised real-time process. Our execution model incorporates real-time constraints and is configurable through message routing policies distributed as a knowledge base containing rule sets, and therefore dispenses with the need for a central orchestration component which could easily become a bottleneck. Deterministic behaviour can be achieved through the validation of the rule-sets and the use of Modular Performance Analysis (MPA). We analyse the performance of our architecture using the Real-Time Calculus and show by empirical evaluation that our method scales to a typical real-time process application found in a tactical naval combat system context.}

abstract = {Background
The cell and gene therapy (CGT) field is at a critical juncture. Clinical successes have underpinned the requirement for developing manufacturing capacity suited to patient-specific therapies that can satisfy the eventual demand post-launch. Decentralised or ‘redistributed’ manufacturing divides manufacturing capacity across geographic regions, promising local, responsive manufacturing, customised to the end user, and is an attractive solution to overcome challenges facing the CGT manufacturing chain.
Methods
A study was undertaken building on previous, so far unpublished, semi-structured interviews with key opinion leaders in advanced therapy research, manufacturing and clinical practice. The qualitative findings were applied to construct a cost of goods model that permitted the cost impact of regional siting to be combined with variable and fixed costs of manufacture of a mesenchymal stromal cell product.
Results
Using the United Kingdom as an exemplar, cost disparities between regions were examined. Per patient dose costs of ~£1,800 per 75,000,000 cells were observed. Financial savings from situating the facility outside of London allow 25–41 additional staff or 24–35 extra manufacturing vessels to be employed. Decentralised quality control to mitigate site-to-site variation was examined. Partial decentralisation of quality control was observed to be financially possible and an attractive option for facilitating release ‘at risk’.
Discussion
There are important challenges that obstruct the easy adoption of decentralised manufacturing that have the potential to undermine the market success of otherwise promising products. By using the United Kingdom as an exemplar, the modelled data provide a framework to inform similar regional policy considerations across other global territories.}

However, current efforts have, at most, only addressed the first two problem dimensions concurrently and do not account for the propagative effects that uncertain scheduling outcomes in one dimension can have on another dimension. In addition, existing approaches for airline disruption management include human specialists who decide on necessary corrective actions for airline schedule disruptions on the day of operation. However, human specialists are limited in their ability to process copious amounts of information imperative for making robust decisions that simultaneously address all problem dimensions during disruption management. Therefore, there is a need to augment the decision-making capabilities of a human specialist with quantitative and qualitative tools that can rationalize complex interactions amongst all dimensions in airline disruption management, and provide objective insights to the specialists in the airline operations control center. To that effect, we provide a discussion and demonstration of an agnostic and systematic paradigm for enabling expeditious simultaneously-integrated recovery of all problem dimensions during airline disruption management, through an intelligent multi-agent system that employs principles from artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. Results indicate that our paradigm for simultaneously-integrated recovery executes in polynomial time and is effective when all the flights in the airline route network are disrupted.}

This paper focuses on solving the optimal power flow problem in a distribution network with a fully decentralized mode that has massive photovoltaics and electric vehicles. First, an optimal power flow model considering photovoltaics and electric vehicles as controllable agents was established to achieve low network loss, low curtailment of photovoltaic resources, and high satisfaction of electric vehicle owners. Second, a novel linearized power flow model was proposed to produce per-node granularity communication. Thus, each node only needed to exchange the voltage message with its neighboring nodes. Then a decentralized quadratically constrained quadratic programming model based on the alternating direction method of multipliers was built to solve the optimal power flow problem. Next, a closed-form iterative solution method for the decentralized optimization was developed to improve the calculation speed for each iteration. Finally, case studies for a real 35-bus distribution system and a real 110-bus distribution system in China were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

The platform is designed to exploit the synergy of two classes of network connections—dedicated and opportunistic. Previous studies we conducted have demonstrated the benefits of such bi-modal resource organization that combines small pools of dedicated computers with a very large pool of opportunistic computing capacities of idle computers to serve high throughput computing applications. This paper extends the idea of bi-modal resource organization into the management of communication resources. Since distributed stream processing applications demand large volume of data transmission between processing sites at a consistent rate, adequate control over the network resources is important to ensure a steady flow of processing. The system model used in this paper is a platform where stream processing servers at distributed sites are interconnected with a combination of dedicated and opportunistic communication links. Two pertinent resource allocation problems are analyzed in detail and solved using decentralized algorithms. One is mapping of the processing and the communication tasks of the stream processing workload on the processing and the communication resources of the platform. The other is the dynamic re-allocation of the communication links due to variations in the capacity of the opportunistic communication links. Overall optimization goal of the allocations is higher task throughput and better utilization of the expensive dedicated links without deviating much from the timely completion of the tasks. The algorithms are evaluated through extensive simulation with a model based on realistic observations. The results demonstrate that the algorithms are able to exploit the synergy of bi-modal communication links towards achieving the optimization goals.}

It is against this background that the decentralisation framework and the Dublin Principles on Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) emphasise the need for a participatory approach to water management. The Zimbabwean government has gone a step further in decentralising the management of irrigation schemes, that is promoting farmer managed irrigation schemes so as to ensure effective management of scarce community based land and water resources. The study set to investigate the way in which the Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme is managed with specific emphasis on the role of the Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), the level of accountability and the powers devolved to the IMC. Merrey’s 2008 critique of IWRM also informs this study which views irrigation as going beyond infrastructure by looking at how institutions and decision making processes play out at various levels including at the irrigation scheme level. The study was positioned on the hypothesis that ‘decentralised or autonomous irrigation management enhances the sustainability and effectiveness of irrigation schemes’. To validate or falsify the stated hypothesis, data was gathered using desk research in the form of reviewing articles, documents from within the scheme and field research in the form of questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and field observation. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to analyse data quantitatively, whilst content analysis was utilised to analyse qualitative data whereby data was analysed thematically. Comparative analysis was carried out as Guyu-Chelesa irrigation scheme was compared with other smallholder irrigation scheme’s experiences within Zimbabwe and the Sub Saharan African region at large. The findings were that whilst the scheme is a model of a decentralised entity whose importance lies at improving food security and employment creation within the community, it falls short in representing a downwardly accountable decentralised irrigation scheme. The scheme is faced with various challenges which include its operation which is below capacity utilisation, absence of specialised technical human personnel to address infrastructural breakdowns, uneven distribution of water pressure, incapacitated Irrigation Management Committee (IMC), absence of a locally legitimate constitution, compromised beneficiary participation and unclear lines of communication between various institutions involved in water management. Understanding decentralization is important since one of the key tenets of IWRM is stakeholder participation which the decentralization framework interrogates.}

With respect to technical aspects, the vehicle chosen has been found to be a satisfactory choice, whereas the productivity of collection is still too low due to the dispersion of collection points. Concerning financial aspects, the cost model reveals that the scale of the scheme is still too small to be completely sustained by its own revenues, but this objective of self-sustainability is achievable within the limits defined for the system, by adding a determined number of new customers without exceeding the fixed maximum working time and introducing some improvements and time optimisation.}

Our approach innovates by disaggregating decentralization to uncover the specific dimensions that matter for voting participation. We argue that self-rule (or the authority that subnational units exercise in their own territory) is closely associated with vertical accountability and positively affects voting participation. Moreover, we find that political dimensions of self-rule matter more than fiscal dimensions. Shared-rule (or the authority that subnational units exercise in the country as a whole) has no significant effect on participation since it is more closely related to horizontal accountability. We test our theory in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries using a hierarchical model with 2010 data at the national and individual-level.}

abstract = {Summary
Many countries have emphasized hierarchical control or different exit and voice mechanisms to increase accountability of educational systems. We build a framework for understanding accountability reforms and develop three illustrative Latin American cases representing distinct approaches (Chile, Nicaragua, and Bogotá, Colombia). We highlight the complexity of institutional change and the value of flexible reform models. Using an institutional perspective we examine the components of accountability; their complex interrelationships; and the importance of design details, implementation, and monitoring. We argue for balancing clear and efficient top-down monitoring and enforcement with other, less punitive accountability mechanisms including strong local quality support systems.}

Thus, stakeholders struggled to leverage blockchain information systems' full value. Prior studies demonstrated that blockchain systems pose not only technical but also organizational challenges. Analysing six blockchain consortia, we identify their value mechanisms, organizational problems, and organizational solutions that successful blockchain consortia experience while organizing themselves for value. As a result, we propose a new organizational form, i.e., a layered organization, for blockchain consortia to achieve better value creation.}

Though easy to implement and control, centralized systems are difficult and expensive to scale in terms of the number of devices and the flow of information. This set of circumstances calls for a decentralized and distributed architecture for realizing such networked systems. However, due to the absence of global information in decentralized systems, one of the primary challenges is to find the best solution for problems distributed across the devices which are part of the CPS. Since the problems are distributed and no participating device has access to the full information, the devices may need to interact and share the information to select the best solution for a problem occurred. In this paper, we present a decentralized and distributed mechanism, which adapts to a stream of varying problems and continuously evolves and learns the best mappings between the problems and their associated solutions. The proposed approach integrates the concepts propounded in the three major Immune theories and can cater to real-world situations. The evolved mappings are shared across the physical network, thereby accelerating the search for the best set of solutions. In order to validate the performance of the proposed mechanism, we present the results obtained from solving a problem of sorting a stream of varying data in an emulated decentralized and distributed manner. To substantiate its working in real-world scenarios, we also describe the results obtained by embodying the system in real robots that discover the best path-following algorithms.}

abstract = {Research on smart connected vehicles has recently targeted the integration of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks with Machine Learning (ML) tools and distributed decision making. Among these convergent paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) allows the vehicles to train a deep ML model collaboratively, by exchanging model parameters (i.e., neural network weights and biases), rather than raw sensor data, via V2X links. Early FL approaches resorted to a server-client architecture, where a Parameter Server (PS) acts as edge device to orchestrate the learning process. Novel FL tools, on the other hand, target fog architectures where the model parameters are mutually shared by vehicles and synchronized in a distributed manner via consensus algorithms. These tools do not rely on the PS, but take advantage of low-latency V2X links. In line with this recent research direction, in this paper we investigate distributed FL methods for augmenting the capability of road user/object classification based on Lidar data. More specifically, we propose a new modular, decentralized approach to FL, referred to as consensus-driven FL (C-FL), suitable for PointNet compliant deep ML architectures and Lidar point cloud processing for road actor classification. The C-FL process is evaluated by simulating a realistic V2X network, based on the Collective Perception Service (CPS), for mutual sharing of the PointNet model parameters. The performance validation considers the impact of the degree of connectivity of the vehicular network, the benefits of continual learning over heterogeneous training data, convergence time and loss/accuracy tradeoffs. Experimental results indicate that C-FL complies with the extended sensors use cases for high levels of driving automation, it provides a low-latency training service, compared with existing distributed ML approaches, and it outperforms ego learning with minimal bandwidth usage.}

Based on ethnographic work with a forestry management intervention purporting to implement decentralization, the paper shows that power struggles center on the formation of local authorities (institutional choice) and the technical framing of forest management. It also illuminates the ways that technical claims and politico-legal counterclaims and their supporting discourses shape these struggles. The project engendered awareness among local governments about the economic and political stakes involved in forest management, which sparked resistance to the project's technically oriented institutional choices. The paper demonstrates the effects of institutional choice legitimated by discourses that privilege technical requirements and outside expertise. Importantly, the research also indicates that power struggles over resources are dynamic. Technical discourses can be countered by arguments that evoke the need for broad-based political participation, lawfulness and democracy.}

To address these challenges, the concept of the autonomous supply chain (ASC), characterised by predictive and self-decision-making capabilities, has recently emerged as a promising solution. However, research on ASCs is relatively limited, with no existing studies specifically focusing on their implementations. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting an implementation of ASC using a multi-agent approach. It presents a methodology for the analysis and design of such an agent-based ASC system (A2SC). This paper provides a concrete case study, the autonomous meat supply chain, which showcases the practical implementation of the A2SC system using the proposed methodology. Additionally, a system architecture and a toolkit for developing such A2SC systems are presented. Despite limitations, this work demonstrates a promising approach for implementing an effective ASC system.}

In-house efficacy of such systems has been greatly improved due to lean six-sigma methodologies; however, wider scale distribution and supply has undergone little to no transformation over the past century. Research pertaining to distributed manufacture, cloud-manufacture and reconfigurable systems have provided several decentralized models using traditional manufacturing capabilities. Due to practical limitations they have not been fully realized to date. This paper outlines the emerging concept and scope for hybrid manufacturing platforms – systems using a plurality of processes on a single motion platform, to manufacture products in a decentralized network. Necessity of on-machine inspection is highlighted, outlining the potential of generic artifact machine calibration and verification of parts made. A robust experimental method using a novel hybrid manufacturing approach is used to realize the post-process adaptation of subsequent parts and demonstrates significant improvement with adapted features being cut within 15μm of nominal position, compared to the original 300μm error. Social, economic and environmental ramifications of adopting such a system are highlighted. The combination of several key processes will allow users to manufacture parts with minimal intervention. A move to personal fabrication would allow greater customization and convenience for the end user; however, the issues of copyright and loss of economy of scale would inhibit mass uptake in the near-future. Growing interest by enthusiasts and early adopters will continue to make an impact on the way the populace views manufacture.}

This article shows that institutions cannot be reduced to their technical functions but that they are based on particular collective imaginaries that ground what is legitimate or not and structure the relationship of individuals to power and the meaning given to their actions. It encourages the consideration of cultural framework of meaning; these local cultural references structure the governance modalities of a society, understood in terms of the modalities of exercise of power in a given group (state, company, local authority, etc.). It advocates the necessity to move from a technic-prone approach in the implementation of institutional changes towards a socio-cultural approach that integrates the local expectations of what “good governance” should be and on which depends the legitimacy of institutions and their appropriation by local populations.}

Such a transition has considerable spatial-physical and socioeconomic implications, suggesting area-based perspectives and related decentralized governance approaches as being crucial to complement, or partly replace, traditional centralized governance approaches. In response to implementation barriers to energy policies, China has also begun to experiment with more decentralized governance structures through the launch of national pilot programs. In the meantime, international studies have disputed the widely assumed benefits of decentralized approaches. Scholars have especially cautioned that decentralization needs to be informed about the degree to which local stakeholders are willing and able to cope with newly acquired responsibilities or tasks. This research investigates the willingness and ability of Chinese local authorities to perform tasks indicated in the pilot program ‘New Energy Demonstration City (NEDC)’. This research, involving four case study cities and over 20 expert interviews, noted only modest willingness and ability. Local performance is constrained by inadequate local technical and managerial ability and a possible weak profile of renewable energy compared to other local priorities, and a limited local scope of influence over energy transition-related challenges as well decreased local willingness and ability. This research concludes that decentralization under energy policies should take place within a context of central support and stimuli, highlighting the importance of national policies and regulations to enable and activate local authorities and stakeholders in pursuing energy transition policies.}

abstract = {The dramatic reduction in the cost of renewable energy production during the 2020s, especially in roof-top solar, followed by a similar cost reduction trajectory with batteries, suggested to many a smooth transition from nuclear and fossil fuels to solar and wind. But centralized and blunt policy and price signals including massive worldwide subsidies for incumbent industries have perpetuated established patterns of much of the generation and distribution system remaining far from where it is consumed, leading to the higher electricity network and grid stabilization costs. To allow renewables to be scaled efficiently, variable renewable energy, such as solar and wind, need to be consumed much closer to where they are produced enabling a much closer link to the consumer. Time and place price signals are needed to make this happen thus creating the need for a transactive electricity system. This change to how the power system works is fundamentally different so resistance to change in the incumbent conventional and centralized energy industry became glaring as renewable power emerged as critical to a climate-stable economy. A Transactive Electricity system challenges the whole centralized power business model and has significant social and security implications but promises multiple benefits. This chapter suggests that the transition is aided by a fundamental overhaul of how the distributed market model can operate and, in particular, how digital systems, including machine learning, AI, and blockchain, potentially support renewables becoming locally dispatchable through transactive energy markets. We provide initial results of trials using the “time and place transactive model”. This model can first leapfrog into places where regulatory push back from traditional grid and supply interests is least intense and then expand across energy markets in a Kuhnian way, creating a new energy paradigm.}

However, the participation of unknown nodes and node administrators pursuing heterogeneous trust and security goals is a challenge. Community-mesh networks are good examples of such environments due to their open structure, decentralized management, and ownership. As a result, existing community networks are vulnerable to various attacks and are seriously challenged by the obligation to find consensus on the trustability of participants within an increasing user size and diversity. We propose a practical and novel solution enabling a secured but decentralized trust management. This work presents the design and analysis of securely-entrusted multi-topology routing (SEMTOR), a set of routing-protocol mechanisms that enable the cryptographically secured negotiation and establishment of concurrent and individually trusted routing topologies for infrastructure-less networks without relying on any central management. The proposed mechanisms have been implemented, tested, and evaluated for their correctness and performance to exclude non-trusted nodes from the network. Respective safety and liveness properties that are guaranteed by our protocol have been identified and proven with formal reasoning. Benchmarking results, based on our implementation as part of the BMX7 routing protocol and tested on real and minimal (OpenWRT, 10 Euro) routers, qualify the behaviour, performance, and scalability of our approach, supporting networks with hundreds of nodes despite the use of strong asymmetric cryptography.}

Uncertainty on specific actions and strategies remains, leading to a research-implementation gap. For Ecuador, one of the key challenges to local adaptation are the institutional capacities of the decentralized autonomous governments (GAD, Spanish acronym). Therefore, the objective of this study is firstly to apply a capacity development strategy developed by GIZ (2013a) in the context of limited knowledge and resources and secondly gain a deeper understanding of climate action in Ecuador on a provincial level. The case study is based on an experimental participatory workshop in the coastal province of Santa Elena, Ecuador. The applied methodology has three components: firstly, semi-structured expert interviews on climate action in Ecuador; secondly, the participatory workshops with technicians and employees of the provincial government, its analysis together with a pre-, post- and two-months-after the workshop follow-up survey; thirdly, the analysis of the workshop is complemented by a peer validation of the co-facilitators. The analysis of the workshop suggests that in a context of limited institutional capacity, an understanding of climate change terminology, vulnerability and adaptive capacity is crucial to interpret predictions and to motivate action. Additionally, results indicate that pairing the content of the seminar with elements of project management might also strengthen local planning and longevity of rural development measures. Overall, the methodology of GIZ might therefore not be suitable in the local context due to its fast pace and difficult terminology. A more promising approach to foster local climate action is the Design-Thinking (DT) methodology due to its easier accessibility. Based on the insights of the case study a capacity development strategy incorporating DT offers lessons learnt for practitioners aiming to promote local climate action in comparable institutional contexts of limited knowledge and resources. As limited knowledge and resources are often main barriers to climate action, developing capacity building strategies will in turn foster climate action.}

In response to this new technological phenomenon, we studied whether and how herding behaviors take place in the context of blockchain applications for operations in this research. We propose two new variables related to the operation of the blockchain application (i.e., technical assurance and decentralized management efforts) and a new variable related to user identity (i.e., identifiability). We found evidence of the existence of herding by utilizing the objective data of approximately 0.1 million transactions on a leading blockchain application platform providing self-service and collateral-based lending services. Our empirical findings also reveal that technical assurance and decentralized management efforts reduce users' herding tendencies. Moreover, we found that the higher the identifiability, the lower the users' herding tendency, and the less they are affected by technical assurance and decentralized management efforts.}

The majority of theoretical and empirical studies on the relationship between decentralization and corruption argue that the devolution of power might be a feasible instrument for use in keeping corruption at bay. We argue that this result crucially depends on the effectiveness of monitoring bureaucrats’ behavior. The benefits of decentralization only occur if there is a supervisory body such as a free press, which is often lacking in a substantial number of countries. Using cross-country data, we analyze the relationship between decentralization and corruption, taking different degrees of the freedom of the press into account. Our main finding is that decentralization counteracts corruption in countries with high degrees of freedom of the press, whereas countries without effective monitoring suffer from decentralization. Our policy implication is that a free press is a necessary pre-condition for successful decentralization programs.}

abstract = {Nowadays, modern automotive systems include a great number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs). These ECUs provide many sophisticated systems such as engine control, antilock braking systems, etc. This fact has increased the automotive embedded networks complexity. Another important issue in this field is the necessity to define a suitable diagnosis strategy to prevent faults propagation. The integration of diagnosis functions into the automotive embedded systems contributes to overload the communication protocols. In this context, solutions for checking latencies entailed by extra-data traffic are urgently needed. Throughout this paper, a novel approach for the automotive diagnosis design, which is based on the Controller Area Network (CAN) analysis, is detailed. The principal contribution of this work consists in developing a decentralized fault diagnosis and studying its data traffic effect on messages deadlines. Our novel method, “CAN real-time analysis based on decentralized fault diagnosis”, is a step ahead to a reliable early phase automotive design. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is applied on a model of an advanced anti-crash system. The proposed design methodology presents several advantages. It optimizes the schedulability of tasks and facilitates the design validation. Moreover, a realistic hardware-in-the-loop simulation is carried out to validate our work.}

It analyses relevant governance structures in each country and identifies where regulation is conducive to the above goals and where it is acting as a barrier. Given that deregulation and decentralization are part of achieving the EU’s energy strategy, the chapter examines where Slovenia stands on that front and what specific initiatives and projects are underway toward greater deregulation and decentralization. Such initiatives include rollouts of smart metering systems and electric vehicles as well as launching demand response schemes. The chapter also addresses relevant data protection concerns.}

abstract = {The widespread diffusion of Online Social Networks has given unforeseen opportunities for their users to share contents and mutually interact. However, current platforms offer inadequate guarantees as far as concerns the privacy of their users. To address these issues and leave to the users more control on their data, several recent proposals suggest to decentralize the storage of social data, aiming at leaving their control entirely to their owners. This approach has lead to the definition of Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs), ranging from completely decentralized solutions, i.e. P2P solutions, to hybrid systems integrating external and private resources for storing user data. While DOSNs allow users to have more control over their data, they raise new challenges concerning the management and availability of social data. Guaranteeing data availability in a highly dynamic environment, defining proper algorithms for information diffusion and guaranteeing data privacy in a distributed setting are currently open problems in this area. This survey presents an overview of these challenges and of the main solutions presented in the literature. Existing proposals are classified taking into account the strategies adopted to manage social data, focusing on the data availability and on information diffusion. The survey also presents the new privacy issues arising in DOSNs. Finally, an overview of the main open issues in this research area is presented.}

abstract = {Mountainous areas have particular characteristics, whose influence on energy planning is explored in this paper, through a suitably tailored methodology applied to the case of Greece. The core element of the methodology is a linear optimization model with a “total cost” objective function, which includes financial, as well as external costs and benefits. Altitude proves to have decisive influence on energy optimization results, because it affects energy demand. The improvement of local energy systems provides greater socioeconomic benefits in mountainous settlements, due to the high shares of renewables and energy efficiency interventions in the optimal solutions. Energy poverty can be alleviated by redesigning local energy systems and the structure of the energy market. However, spatial and aesthetic restrictions, presented often in mountainous settlements, may affect the operational costs of energy systems, which is a crucial parameter for confronting energy poverty. Furthermore, the study indicates that it could be better to electrify remote areas, far from electricity grids, by decentralized systems than by grid expansion. The results of this study and the assumptions made about the way in which energy market should function, could be utilized for reconsidering energy policy measures, aiming at supporting sensitive societies to improve their development perspectives.}

abstract = {The recent advances in technology sectors often clash with traditional organizational paradigms which can limit or make difficult an efficient implementation in the real world. In this paper we show how it is possible to exploit the advantages of innovative technologies in manufacturing when these are supported by new and efficient methods for production management. More in details, we face a flow shop scheduling problem in a shoe manufacturing system in which overtaking of jobs is allowed thanks to an innovative transportation system. Overtaking means that a job can be put in waiting state and another job can surpass it, allowing the change of the scheduling sequence. Preemption is not allowed. The objective function of the problem is the minimization of the maximum lateness. We propose a decentralized model, based on multi-agent system theory, to represent the production cells of the plant and to include the potentiality offered by overtaking of jobs at decisional level. The adoption of a decentralized approach increases the system flexibility since each machine is able to solve its local scheduling problem. Adding or removing machines to the plant will not imply a change in the scheduling algorithms. The outcomes of this work are reached firstly through a formulation of the problem with three flow shop scheduling models, secondly through a comparison of the models with respect to different performance indicators. The results highlight as the decentralized approach is able to reach comparable performances with the centralized one for a relevant number of instances. Moreover sensitivity analysis shows as in the decentralized model the computational time required to solve bigger instances increases less quickly than in the case of centralized ones. Finally, simulations of the decentralized approach clarify as the correlation of the local solution procedure is effected by the number of machines of the flow shop and the coordination mechanism is effected by the number of the jobs to be scheduled.}

The global network to eradicate blindness emerged out of the work of Western and South Asian professionals to eradicate smallpox which was endemic in South Asia. The history of the emergence of the global network to eradicate blindness demonstrates a shift from vertical command and control public health programs directed by the WHO, to the decentralized public health services originating in non-profit, non-governmental organizations and coordinated by the WHO. The WHO constitution started with a federal regionalist structure that encouraged collaboration and coordination with NGOs. In South Asia in particular, epidemiologists and general medical practitioners moved from eradicating smallpox through the WHO to creating their own domestic and international NGOs based in various countries with a mission to control blindness in South Asia and Africa. In 1975, pushed by the WHO Director General, these new NGOs in turn joined with individual ophthalmologists and existing blind member associations to form the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. Thus, the WHO was shaped by, and shaping, international NGOs such as the IAPB. The IAPB pushed for the formation of the WHO Prevention of Blindness program. This was the earliest example of how the IAPB facilitates bottom-up agenda-setting in the WHO. In 1980, when the WHO officially closed the smallpox program, the Prevention of Blindness program first received independent funding. Presently, the IAPB acts as a decentralized arm of the WHO.}

Relatively few studies, however, consider the power interests at stake. Why do state agencies decentralize power, what political patterns unfold, and how do outcomes affect the responses of resource users? This paper explores decentralization reform by investigating the political processes behind the Philippine state's decisions to transfer authority over national parks management to local government units. Drawing on a case of devolved management at Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, Palawan Island, we examine how political motives situated at different institutional scales affect the broader process of decentralization, the structure of management institutions, and overall livelihood security. We demonstrate how power struggles between the Philippine state and City Government of Palawan over the right to manage the national park have impacted the livelihood support offered by community-based conservation. We conclude that decentralization may offer empowering results when upper-level policies and political networks tie into sufficiently organized institutions at the local level.}

Decentralized SCC paradigm could offer various contemporary advantages such as individual suppliers’ decision right protection and overall decision efficiency enhancement. This paper proposes an optimization system, atcPortal, to practically enable such a decentralized SCC process. Individual suppliers convert their local decision support systems into decision web services to form a distributed open-standard SCC service platform, called supply chain grid (SCG) in this paper. As a decomposition-based optimization method, analytical target cascading (ATC) is the mechanism for atcPortal to coordinate these web services through three phases of service searching, service-based ATC problem definition, and service-oriented ATC execution. atcPortal is a generic and extensible web portal in the sense that ATC accommodates a variety of decentralized SCC decision structures without confining the local decision models of individual enterprises. Finally, the usage of atcPortal is demonstrated through a typical decentralized SCC problem.}

To cope with critically deficient water services, a local NGO supported by different donors has promoted decentralized water systems (DWS) that have spread in the city outskirts, based on a model with original features compared to other African experiences. Here, we intend to provide an empirically grounded and analytically sound inquiry into the relevance, efficiency and sustainability of these DWSs in the context of the megacity of Kinshasa. First, we analyze water provision data from the national water utility and compare these to the detailed operational results of the DWSs to estimate the magnitude and efficiency of this alternative mechanism. Second, the principles identified by Elinor Ostrom as being crucial for institutions to successfully manage commons provide us with a fruitful analytic framework to assess DWS performance and sustainability. We show that some of these criteria are broadly met, but the fulfillment of other criteria is still uncertain. We conclude with a balanced assessment of the efficiency and sustainability of this approach and identify the key challenges.}
