abstract = {Dumbbell-like nanoparticles, previously known for their excellent light absorption and dispersion, have diverse applications, especially in SERS. Herein, we have explored a fast and novel controlled synthesis approach to achieve a high formation of AuNDBs. Precise control of precursor amounts and seed addition order halted seed growth at the AuNDB formation stage, preventing further elongation into rod-like structures. The AuNDBs were functionalized with 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) to create SERS nanosubstrates and deposited on the glass slide through 3-mercaptopropyl (dimethoxy)methylsilane by the spin-coating technique. The detection of d-glucose was achieved by measuring the signal decrease of the 4-MBA Raman probe molecules on the nanosubstrates at different trace concentrations of the analyte. These novel SERS substrates have the potential to provide an enhancement factor (EF) of 2.41 × 107 and a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 1.17 nmol/L. The electromagnetic field distribution of AuNDBs with many arrangements surrounded by air and d-glucose solutions was also determined by using the finite-difference time-domain technique (FDTD). The FDTD results confirmed that d-glucose on the SERS substrates caused the local electromagnetic field to degrade, resulting in the degree of the Raman signal. Our findings suggest that dumbbell-shaped SERS substrates can effectively detect very low levels of glucose, making them ideal for designing novel anisotropic nanoparticle-functionalized surfaces with ease.}

abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reshaping society's production methods and productivity, and also changing the paradigm of scientific research. Among them, the AI language model represented by ChatGPT has made great progress. Such large language models (LLMs) serve people in the form of AI-generated content (AIGC) and are widely used in consulting, healthcare, and education. However, it is difficult to guarantee the authenticity and reliability of AIGC learning data. In addition, there are also hidden dangers of privacy disclosure in distributed AI training. Moreover, the content generated by LLMs is difficult to identify and trace, and it is difficult to cross-platform mutual recognition. The above information security issues in the coming era of AI powered by LLMs will be infinitely amplified and affect everyone's life. Therefore, we consider empowering LLMs using blockchain technology with superior security features to propose a vision for trusted AI. This survey mainly introduces the motivation and technical route of blockchain for LLM (BC4LLM), including reliable learning corpus, secure training process, and identifiable generated content. Meanwhile, this survey also reviews the potential applications and future challenges, especially in the frontier communication networks field, including network resource allocation, dynamic spectrum sharing, and semantic communication. Based on the above work combined with the prospect of blockchain and LLMs, it is expected to help the early realization of trusted AI and provide guidance for the academic community.}

We briefly identify three different reasons a company might adopt blockchain: to enhance value creation, to strengthen existing value ecosystems, or to create new value ecosystems. Then, we identify three strategic risks of blockchain adoption as they relate to business issues, legal issues, and technological issues. Finally, we highlight four different strategic maneuvers for minimizing these risks. The strategic maneuvers include the all-industry approach, the walled-garden approach, the many-gardens approach, and the options approach. We provide prescriptive advice to managers on how to strategically think about blockchain adoptions, how to identify the underlying risks, and how to consider strategic approaches to mitigate their adoption risk.}

Most of previous research studies employed the AI and the BT separately with limited efforts providing a conceptual view for possible convergence in real-life applications. Nevertheless, such efforts do not address construction applications. This research introduces a novel tailorable decentralized AI system that utilizes BT as a computing-oriented technology. The proposed system is developed as an inference engine while having a number of interesting features. First, the system validates and audits the decision-making process while sharing and recording the input data and the computed outcomes in a synchronized trusted manner. Second, the system allows the formation of distributed AI repository that can absorb and manage concurrent use-cases while targeting different scopes and covering diverse AI branches. Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data. A case study of estimating the construction cost for road projects is provided to illustrate the system’s workability and demonstrate its performance.}

Exogenous events such as cyber-attacks and their media coverage can strongly affect their supply and demand, adoption and usage, efficiency, and infrastructural development, thus influencing their price stability and market valuation. Given the great technical complexity of blockchains, we believe that a pure economic analysis of risks associated with cryptocurrencies is simply not sufficient to convey the relationships between attacks and the disruptive effects that these can bring on the operation of cryptocurrencies. On these grounds, we survey the most common types of attacks for Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies and evaluate their impact on the returns of a number of real-world cryptocurrencies for which market data are available. Due to data availability, our event study analysis focuses on instances of 51% attacks, hard forks, and wallet attacks. The main goal of our analysis is to understand the relationship between technical events (cyber-attacks and coordinated user/miner behavior) and the economic impacts surrounding them. We aim to develop a deeper understanding of these systems that are objects of great research interest in separate disciplines, supporting policymakers in their regulatory decisions concerning crypto-assets and associated cyber-related financial risks.}

In this study, new targets of WOG were predicted for lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colon cancer by using bioinformatics methods. WOG might primarily suppress cancers via regulating arachidonic acid, Ras, MAPK, linoleic acid, PI3K-Akt, and folate biosynthesis pathways. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay showed that WOG inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) results indicated that anti-lung cancer effect of WOG was achieved by regulating the expression of 18 target genes, including AKR1B10, AKR1C3, BDNF, CAV1, CXCL2, CYP2B6, CYP4F3, DAO, EGF, ENO3, IL6, PLA2G1B, PLA2G2F, PLA2G4A, PTGES, SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3, and TFAP2A. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves further confirmed that DAO, PLA2G1B, SLCO1B3 and TFAP2A were essential targets via which WOG affected lung cancer survival. Moreover, BDNF, FGF2, and PTGS1 were predicted to be the targets via which WOG alleviated cancer proliferation and invasion in bladder cancer. As for colon cancer, WOG might induce autophagy and inhibit proliferation by down-regulating NTF4 and TH. The study will provide clue for using WOG as a promising antineoplastic agent in basic and translational research, and bring light to the application of herbs containing WOG as food supplements.}

We introduce the concept of the technical frontier to delimit the kinds of interactions that can feasibly be structured algorithmically among pseudonymous agents, as on a blockchain, and show that lending and financial intermediation – unlike monetary exchange – lie outside it, even in simple forms. The path forward for truly blockchain-native financial applications, therefore, must involve the integration of real-world identity information in order to disincentivize defection. We discuss several potential technologies for doing so, and conclude that such integration is possible without compromising pseudonymity, provided real-world identity is available in the breach.}

Therefore, the possibilities of using blockchain for providing scalable management, efficient access, and accountability for the massive numbers of extant and emerging IoT devices merits investigation. In this study, we implement a blockchain-enabled IoT auditing management system complying with ISO/IEC 15408-2 requirements. The implemented system is operated with a stable data retrieval time, i.e. 25.74 to 26.77 microseconds, and a stable compressing and uploading time, i.e. 32.51 and 39.9 microseconds when handling and accessing below 100 logs. With more logs, the processing time raises in a proportional manner. The introduced auditing system represents an evolutionary paradigm not only possessing the advantageous characteristics of blockchain technology, i.e. de-centralization, robustness and tamper-resistance, but also fulfilling the critical requirements from ISO/IEC 15408-2 with respect to auditing perspective. Moreover, the scalability is guaranteed, as our proposed IoT auditing management system is suitable for versatile IoT-oriented application services (even on heterogeneous platforms).}

Further, a conceptual analysis of the model is made to discuss the alterations in the intelligence offerings with the enhancing implementation level of smart manufacturing systems. Based on the graphical analysis, the various level of organizational maturity with the enhancing smart manufacturing implementation is deliberated.

Our research method is a multiple case study examining a total of 120 use cases. across all primary types of intellectual properties including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, industrial design and geographical indications. The empirical validation is based on an in-depth within-case analysis of 26 applications which were selected from the initial 120 cases based on business maturity and popularity criteria.

We also investigate which blockchain benefits, in terms of technological security, immutability, decentralization, tokenization or disintermediation are promoted by these applications. We triangulate our case study results using a PESTEL coding framework to better understand how the blockchain ecosystem manages the intellectual property life cycle and to provide scholarly researchers and practitioners with insights on how enterprises can use distributed ledger technology to enhance the management of the intellectual property value chain. Moreover, we validate theoretical findings through the evidence collected from our multiple case study analysis, and finally we provide strategic guidance in investigating the current and anticipated challenges of blockchain entrepreneurs to drive further distributed ledger innovation.}

In this article, we demonstrate that contemporary financial reporting systems have the capacity to contribute significantly to the generation of innovation-relevant competitive intelligence. This potential arises because, as part of its regular work, the financial reporting system compiles, collects, analyzes, and synthesizes strategically relevant information about (i) complex internal technical processes related to inventions, discoveries, product development, process innovations, and the like; (ii) detailed sales, cost, and profit forecasts; (iii) consumer trends and innovative developments in the firm’s markets; (iv) actual and potential competitor actions in the market; and (v) regulatory changes, macro-economic trends, and information about the likely impact of government policies. We argue that this competitive intelligence can, if properly harnessed, lead to better informed discourses and decisions around innovation. Consequently, we highlight the potential—from both academic research and practical perspectives—of financial reporting as an enabler of innovation-relevant competitive intelligence embeddedness within firms.}

Background
Four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often relies on the injection of gadolinium- or iron-oxide-based contrast agents to improve vessel delineation. In this work, a novel technique is developed to acquire and reconstruct 4D flow data with excellent dynamic visualization of blood vessels but without the need for contrast injection. Synchronization of Neighboring Acquisitions by Physiological Signals (SyNAPS) uses pilot tone (PT) navigation to retrospectively synchronize the reconstruction of two free-running three-dimensional radial acquisitions, to create co-registered anatomy and flow images.
Methods
Thirteen volunteers and two Marfan syndrome patients were scanned without contrast agent using one free-running fast interrupted steady-state (FISS) sequence and one free-running phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) sequence. PT signals spanning the two sequences were recorded for retrospective respiratory motion correction and cardiac binning. The magnitude and phase images reconstructed, respectively, from FISS and PC-MRI, were synchronized to create SyNAPS 4D flow datasets. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) flow data were acquired for reference in ascending (AAo) and descending aorta (DAo). The blood-to-myocardium contrast ratio, dynamic vessel area, net volume, and peak flow were used to compare SyNAPS 4D flow with Native 4D flow (without FISS information) and 2D flow. A score of 0–4 was given to each dataset by two blinded experts regarding the feasibility of performing vessel delineation.
Results
Blood-to-myocardium contrast ratio for SyNAPS 4D flow magnitude images (1.5 ± 0.3) was significantly higher than for Native 4D flow (0.7 ± 0.1, p < 0.01) and was comparable to 2D flow (2.3 ± 0.9, p = 0.02). Image quality scores of SyNAPS 4D flow from the experts (M.P.: 1.9 ± 0.3, E.T.: 2.5 ± 0.5) were overall significantly higher than the scores from Native 4D flow (M.P.: 1.6 ± 0.6, p = 0.03, E.T.: 0.8 ± 0.4, p < 0.01) but still significantly lower than the scores from the reference 2D flow datasets (M.P.: 2.8 ± 0.4, p < 0.01, E.T.: 3.5 ± 0.7, p < 0.01). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the dynamic vessel area measured on SyNAPS 4D flow and that from 2D flow was 0.69 ± 0.24 for the AAo and 0.83 ± 0.10 for the DAo, whereas the Pearson correlation between Native 4D flow and 2D flow measurements was 0.12 ± 0.48 for the AAo and 0.08 ± 0.39 for the DAo. Linear correlations between SyNAPS 4D flow and 2D flow measurements of net volume (r2 = 0.83) and peak flow (r2 = 0.87) were larger than the correlations between Native 4D flow and 2D flow measurements of net volume (r2 = 0.79) and peak flow (r2 = 0.76).
Conclusion
The feasibility and utility of SyNAPS were demonstrated for joint whole-heart anatomical and flow MRI without requiring electrocardiography gating, respiratory navigators, or contrast agents. Using SyNAPS, a high-contrast anatomical imaging sequence can be used to improve 4D flow measurements that often suffer from poor delineation of vessel boundaries in the absence of contrast agents.}

abstract = {Operators are coming up with new solutions that use grid topology as an innovative response to future mobility requirements and the increasing management costs for wireless access networks. Proximity Radio Access Network (P-RAN), which was proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), expands the cellular structure from base station to intelligent terminal equipment through device to device (D2D) technology, which provides a cost-effective deployment solution for the 5G and 6G. The extensive deployment of P-RAN solution should be based on the active participation of a large number of distributed intelligent equipment users. Fair, reasonable and credible incentive solution is the key to realize the sustainable operation of this distributed system. This paper introduces a technical solution that applying blockchain technology to design P-RAN operating and incentive mechanism. Through blockchain technology, the current centralized P-RAN operation and incentive can be achieved in point-to-point way. By utilizing blockchain-based identity authentication and asymmetric key pairs, user and relay can confirm and sign the network usage information in sequence to reduce disputes. The abstract of all transactions related to P-RAN services can be recorded on blockchain immutably as the calculation basis of relay rewards. Through smart contracts and P-RAN incentive policy, relays that provide more and higher quality P-RAN service will be rewarded more, which can help to create positive feedback in this decentralized system. The tokens awarded to relays will be able to exchange through the blockchain network for the increase of the whole ecosystem utility. Blockchain-based P-RAN operation and incentive solution pioneer a way to the future heterogeneous network resource sharing and collaboration for supporting Web3.0 and Metaverse.}

These materials were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Their adsorption performances were evaluated through a series of experiments including isothermal adsorption, kinetic adsorption, selective adsorption, adsorption–desorption, reusability, and preparation reproducibility. Additionally, the application was explored by investigating the extraction recovery of MIPMs towards PHT, phenobarbital (PHB) and lamotrigine (LTG) in different matrices including methanol, normal saline (NS), phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and plasma. The results showed that MIPMs with rough and porous surfaces were successfully constructed, which offered good preparation reproducibility, reusability and selectivity. The adsorption capacities of MIPMs towards PHT, PHB and LTG were 2.312, 2.485 and 2.303 mg g−1, respectively, while their corresponding imprinting factors were 8.538, 12.122 and 4.562, respectively. The adsorption equilibrium of MIPMs was achieved within 20 min at room temperature without stirring or ultrasonication. The extraction recoveries of MIPMs for PHT, PHB or LTG in methanol, NS and PBS were more than 80% with an RSD% value of less than 3.64. In the case of plasma, the extraction recovery of MIPMs for PHT and PHB was more than 80% with an RSD% value of less than 2.41, while that of MIPMs for LTG was more than 65% with an RSD% value of less than 0.99. All the results indicated that the preparation method for MIPMs was simple, stable, and reliable, and the prepared MIPMs possessed excellent properties to meet the extraction application of PHT, PHB and LTG in different matrices.}

This paper highlights the critical role of digital governance in facilitating digitally enabled exchange relationships. To this end, we propose a typology of analog, augmented, and automated governance modes, each associated with specific control, coordination, incentive, and trust mechanisms. Additionally, we provide a heuristic for determining the optimal governance choice via the interplay of transactivity (i.e.,the contributors, connections, and consistency in an exchange network) and corresponding governance costs. Our study advances the governance literature by defining digital governance as a distinct form and outlining key governance mechanisms and choices in the digital era. Finally, we identify avenues for future research in this field.}

In this study, the accumulation effect of PE-MPs in the intestine of large-scale loach (Paramisgurnus dabryanus) was explored by adding different concentrations of PE-MPs to the water, the destination of PE-MPs after breaking the intestinal barrier and the effects caused. The collected data showed that PE-MPs accumulation for 21d altered the histomorphology and antioxidant enzyme activity of the intestine, induced dysbiosis of the intestinal flora. 10 mg/L of PE-MPs induced a significant increase in the transcript levels of intestinal immunity factors in loach after 21d of exposure. Moreover, the levels of diamine oxidase (DAO) and d-lactic acid (D-Lac) in the gut and serum of loach were significantly increased after exposure to PE-MPs at all concentrations (1, 5, 10 mg/L). Subsequently, the presence of PE-MPs was detected in the blood, suggesting that the disruption of the intestinal multilayer barrier allowed PE-MPs to spill into the circulation. The accumulation of PE-MPs (1,5,10 mg/L) in the blood led to massive apoptosis and necrosis of blood cells and activated phagocytosis in response to PE-MPs invasion. To alleviate the damage, this study further exposure the effect of probiotics on PE-MPs treated loach by adding Leuconostoc mesenteroides DH (109 CFU/g) to the feed. The results showed that DH significantly increased the intestinal index and reduced the levels of DAO and D-Lac. To investigate the reason, we followed the PE-MPs in the intestine and blood of the loach and found that the number of PE-MPs particles was significantly reduced in the probiotic group, while the PE-MPs content in the feces was elevated. Thus, we concluded that DH reducing the accumulation of PE-MPs in the intestinal by increases fecal PE-MPs, which in turn mitigates the damage to the intestinal barrier caused by PE-MPs, and reduces the amount of PE-MPs in the blood. This work offers a robust analysis to understand the mechanisms of damage to the intestinal barrier by MPs and the fate of MPs after escaping the intestinal barrier and provide a new perspective on the application of probiotics in mitigating PE-MPs toxicity.}

Such a blockchain technology, while incorporated with Supply Chain Management (SCM), is creating a huge impact on the economy. SCM is the technique to maintain the process transformation flow from the purchase of raw materials to the production of final products and plays a vital role in economy streamlining the business activities by aligning those with customer satisfaction while keeping an eye open to the competition. The significance of blockchain in the circular economy is more because it considers not only the business parameters but also the society and the environment too. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts are employed to ensure trustworthiness and reliability in the economy. Blockchain will still be more strengthened by integrating the recent technologies such as the internet of things and machine learning in economy-related applications. An optimal and neutral finance management system will be developed by the proper blending of the aforementioned technologies.

abstract = {To minimize the impacts of climate change, it is increasingly clear that global CO2 emissions should be eliminated by 2050 and that leading low-carbon cities should reach net zero emissions by 2040. However, the precise pathways by which they can reach such ambitious goals have yet to be identified. As costs of photovoltaics (PV), batteries, and electric vehicles (EVs) are likely to keep falling, they can jointly play a key role for deep decarbonization. Here, we conduct a techno-economic analysis of a city-scale energy system with roof-top PV, batteries, and EVs for Kyoto City, Japan. We find that aggressive EV adoption and the use of EVs for electricity storage could help roof-top PV penetration in the city with substantially lower costs than just deploying PV and batteries alone or allowing EV to charge only. CO2 emissions from vehicle and electricity usage in the city could be reduced by 60–74% if the entire current car fleet is replaced by EVs while also reducing energy costs by 22–37% by 2030. The largest challenge of a city-wide “PV + EV” system (named as “Solar-EV city”) is its implementation. We explore how it could be realized in Kyoto through peer-to-peer (P2P) power trading/blockchain technology initially on a community scale as smart microgrids, then gradually expanding/converging into a city-wide. For the transition to decentralized power systems, citizen’s decision-making process is one of the keys to overcome social, institutional, and regulatory barriers.}

The biosensor was prepared through immobilizing uHb on the surface of clay modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by physical adsorption method, and then using 2.5% glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent to fix DAO. In order to achieve the best results, the concentration of DAO, the type of peroxidase, the stability of modified electrode and the test conditions were optimized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used to characterize the preparation process of the sensor. Under the optimized conditions, the difference of reductive peak currents had good linear relationships with putrescine concentration in the ranges of 1.0 × 10−11-1.0 × 10−10 mol L−1 and 1.0 × 10−10-1.0 × 10−9 mol L−1 (r ≥ 0.997), respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) was 3.3 × 10−12 mol L−1 (S/N = 3). The developed electrochemical biosensor had good reproducibility, stability and sensitivity, and was successfully applied for the determination of putrescine in real pork samples.}

We develop a conceptual model and testable propositions that extend the work of McKnight et al. (2001, 2002, 2011) to the blockchain ecosystem based on an integrative literature review. We conceptualize trust as a multidimensional, multi-object construct combining three major objects of trust: algorithmic trust in the blockchain protocol (platform), trust towards peers and services providers, and trust in decentralized applications (product). The model reflects the process of building a trust layer for users and institutions on top of the trustless technology. The paper demystifies the trust building process, from initial trust to knowledge-based trust, and its dimensions within the blockchain ecosystem, and, consequently, helps practitioners to build strategies that increase users' trust. The contribution to the academic literature resides in the unification of multiple perspectives on trust within an integrative conceptual framework to point out the mechanisms of trust building process, as well as to identify future research directions.}

The wisdom of the crowd has been used to gather insights, ideas, and problems by using responses from large numbers of people. In this work, 189 different ANN architectures will be used instead of human agents, thus creating an ANN Crowd. This research explores the question “should every agent in the crowd has the same voice?” To answer this, this research aims to broadly understand the sensitivity of influencing factors (training set selection, nodes, layers, and architecture) in the performance of the ANN Crowd. This will then support refinement to achieve generalizability for the ANN Crowds. The specific focus of this paper is to explore the effect of the training set selection on prediction accuracy. To do this, four different scenarios are explored (2 inputs x 2 outputs). ANN Crowds are created for these scenarios with different product training configurations to test how the training set influences the predictions (k-fold = 10). Results show that training set selection has a statistical and practical influence on prediction accuracy. Analyzing the presence of edge cases in training sets and the effects of training targets suggests further influence of training set selection. Future work includes a deeper exploration of the influence of edge cases within the training sets. Building on this foundation, the members of the ANN Crowd (different architectures) will be studied for their influence on prediction performance.}

Physical and information flows in energy systems are increasingly complex and distributed, leaving centralized structures inefficient. Blockchain technology is suggested as part of the next step in this transition. Blockchain has potential to facilitate distributed, peer-to-peer trading with reduced transaction costs, increased security via cryptography, and prosumer choice. However, there are as of yet multiple challenges to the expansion of blockchain in the energy sector. This paper argues that analysis of these challenges requires a multi-angled approach incorporating technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions. First, each dimension is explored, substantiated based on a blockchain-based energy system case in Japan. Concrete challenges of scaling this case toward 2050 and potential opportunities in overcoming these challenges are discussed, leveraging extensive literature review. Finally, an overview of strategic indications is suggested. The findings of this paper present initial indications on challenges and opportunities to overcome them based on a multi-dimensional overview. It is suggested that the factors identified across the dimensions are interrelated. This would in turn call for coherent innovation management and multi-stakeholder innovation ecosystems. Living Labs and regulatory sandboxes are prospective foundations to support such ecosystems, and enable informed decision-making among both private and public sector actors. At large, it is suggested that a holistic and pragmatic approach can benefit the application and scalability of blockchain in the energy transition.}

abstract = {Producing CO2-foams in saline environments can be a great challenge in many industrial applications, since fast gas diffusion and reduction of electrical double layer promote fast coarsening and coalescence of bubbles. Amine oxides are zwitterionic surfactants that have been shown to improve foam stability by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, but have not been investigated for CO2-foams yet. This paper reports a study on the use of commercial alkyldimethylamine oxides (CxDAO) as foaming agents in brine for CO2-foams, based on the interactions present at the low pH imposed by the dissolution of the CO2 and the presence of salts. Despite the presence of salt and CO2 increased the protonation degree of amine oxide molecules, favoring hydrogen bonding, a significant improvement in foam stability was only observed when using the long chain surfactant (C14DAO). This behavior was attributed to the synergy between increased attractive hydrophobic interactions of alkyl chains and reduced repulsion among ionic surfactant heads, which led to formation of large surfactant aggregates in bulk, as demonstrated by the significant increase in viscosity of the aqueous phase. There was also a decrease in foam drainage and coarsening rates for the foams using C14DAO in brine, compared to results in deionized water, suggesting that formation of hydrogen bonds is not enough to arrest the destabilization in CO2-foams. Moreover, the linear rate of bubble growth obtained for these foams (∝ t) was higher than that reported for N2– or air-foams (∝ t1/2), likely due to the high solubility of CO2 in the aqueous phase, which accelerated the coarsening phenomena. The results of this work offer insight on the future design of foaming formulations for stabilizing CO2-foams in applications that require the use of high salinity brines, such as carbon sequestration and oil recovery.}

Although numerous learning-based solutions have been suggested to assist in vulnerability identification, these approaches often face challenges due to the scarcity of real-world vulnerability data. To extract as much vulnerability information as possible from limited data, we consider obtaining the characteristics of vulnerabilities from different forms of code by leveraging two distinct deep neural models. First, source code functions are considered to be textual sequences, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is applied to extract serialized features. Then, Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of these functions, which reflects the code structure, are fed to a Gated Graph Recurrent Network (GGRN) to obtain structural features indicative of software vulnerability. To better handle data imbalance issues in real-world scenarios, we employ Random Forest (RF) to construct a predictive model to learn the concatenation of serialized and structural features extracted by GRU and GGRN. To evaluate the proposed approach, we collected 12 open-source projects containing function-level samples and compared the proposed method with a series of baselines, including popular learning-based methods and static analysis tools. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the baselines and can identify more vulnerabilities.}

abstract = {The credibility of information on organic agri-products has always blocked the participation of small and medium-sized farms in high value-added agriculture. However, the inherent characteristics of the organic agricultural supply chain (OASC)–such as centralization, monopoly, and asymmetry–have repeatedly plunged OASC into the predicament of information non-transparency. Ultimately, it results in a severe trust crisis of consumers. Fortunately, the emerging blockchain and edge computing technology probably raise an opportunity to improve this issue. Despite the overwhelming advantage (such as tamper-resistant, trust-free, transparent, decentralized, and immutable), this technology has to overcome the imperfection of cost and efficiency before it can be employed by OASC, particularly for geographically dispersed small and medium-sized farms in remote areas. In this paper, we first leverage the immutability of blockchain and the paradigm of edge computing to construct an OASC’s trust framework, which has a much better trade-off between cost and efficiency. Further, according to the scenarios of OASC, we divide all the stakeholders into four roles, proposing a novel consensus mechanism to manage the information flow. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposal can significantly achieve the performance improvement as well as the cost decline compared to the traditional approach. This framework will also make affordable traceability solutions for those in developing countries at a low cost in the future.}

abstract = {Background
Shenfu (SF) injection, a traditional Chinese medication, would improve microcirculation in cardiogenic shock and infectious shock. This study was aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of the SF injection in gut ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury after severe hemorrhagic shock (SHS) and resuscitation. Furthermore, we also investigated the optimal adm？ inistration timing.
Methods
Twenty-four male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham group (sham, n = 6), Control group (n = 6), SF injection group (SF, n = 6), and Delayed Shenfu injection administration group (SF-delay, n = 6). In SHS and resuscitation model, rats were induced by blood draw to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 ± 5 mmHg within 1 h and then maintained for 40 min; HR, MAP ‘were recorded, microcirculation index [De Backer score, perfused small vessel density (PSVD), total vessel density (TVD), microcirculation flow index score (MFI), flow heterogeneity index (HI)] were analyzed. The blood gas index was detected, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), diamine oxidase (DAO), malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by ELISA; ZO-1, and claudin-1 were measured by Western blotting. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and periodic acid schiff (PAS) staining pathological sections of the intestinal mucosal tissues were also performed.
Results
SF injection increased the MAP, relieved the metabolic acidosis degree associated with the hypoperfusion, and improved the intestinal microcirculatory density and perfusion quality after I/R injury. The expression of DAO, MDA in intestinal tissue, and plasma IL-6, TNF-α significantly decreased in the SF injection group compared to the control group. The concentration of ZO-1 and claudin-1 is also higher in the SF injection group. In addition, the HE and PAS staining results also showed that SF injection could decrease mucosal damage and maintain the structure. In the SF-delay group, the degree of intestinal tissue damage was intermediate between that of the control group and SF injection group.
Conclusions
SF injection protect the intestine from I/R injury induced by SHS and resuscitation, the mechanism of which might be through improving intestinal microcirculation, reducing the excessive release of inflammatory factors and increasing intestinal mucosal permeability. Furthermore, the protection effect is more pronounced if administration during the initial resuscitation phase.}

However, the vulnerabilities in on-chain autonomous decision-makings and cumbersome off-chain coordination lead to serious concerns about blockchain’s ability to behave in a trustworthy and efficient way. Blockchain governance has received considerable attention to support the decision-making process during the use and evolution of blockchain. Nevertheless, the conventional governance frameworks do not apply to blockchain due to its distributed architecture and decentralised decision process. These inherent features lead to the absence of a clear source of authority in blockchain ecosystem. Currently, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the governance of blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive blockchain governance framework, which elucidates an integrated view of the degree of decentralisation, decision rights, incentives, accountability, ecosystem, and legal and ethical responsibilities. The above aspects are formulated as six high-level principles for blockchain governance. We demonstrate a qualitative analysis of the proposed framework, including case studies on five extant blockchain platforms, and comparison with existing blockchain governance frameworks. The results show that our proposed framework is feasible and applicable in a real-world context.}

However, the lack of attention paid to the circular economy's social dimension is concerning, given its expected global implementation for 2050. Neglecting this social impact undermines both environmental and social sustainability, perpetuating industry inequalities. To address this problem, this study develops Transformative Circular Futures (TCFs) to inform policy and business decision-making in the textile and apparel value chains of India, the Netherlands and Spain. TCFs are co-created circular economy scenarios that are diverse, systemic, and embedded with social impact considerations. This research employs participatory methods to blend system-change, Circular Economy, social impacts (through a gender lens), and positive desirable futures approaches, resulting in 16 scenarios. The results emphasise the pivotal role of diverse stakeholder engagement in reshaping the textile and apparel value chain towards equitable and transformative circular economy futures. The TCFs-derived recommendations to reduce inequalities and improve workers' well-being are critical steps towards a more inclusive and equitable transition to circular practices in the textile and apparel sector. Common recommendations include normalising living wages for direct, indirect, and informal workers, implementing regulations challenging patriarchy, eliminating gender pay and establishing permanent global committees of social actors. This ensures that social considerations are integrated throughout national and international negotiations within the circular textile and apparel value chain.}

Furthermore, the nanomedicines action mechanism in alleviating the disease process, reducing inflammation, and repairing mucosa has been determined. Zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) have been identified as valuable metallic nanoparticles that exhibit significant anti-inflammatory effects. In this particular experiment, green-formulated ZnNPs were created using sodium lignosulfonate. The characterization of these nanoparticles was conducted using various techniques such as Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). For the in vivo part of the study, adult Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups. The animals were administered ZnNPs (50 µg/kg) or salazosulfapyridine (175 mg/kg) before 5 % dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solutions (0.75 g/kg) intragastric administration. The treatments were conducted for 1 week. Measurements were taken for macroscopic changes in the colon tissue, wet/dry (W/D) weight ratios, disease activity index (DAI), and food intake in 24 h. The levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in the serum were analyzed at 7 or 1 days. Additionally, the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), diamine oxidase (DAO), malonaldehyde (MDA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the colon tissue were measured at 7 days. Furthermore, the activation of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in colon tissue was examined using Western blot and RT-PCR. In rats with acute enteritis, the administration of ZnNPs resulted in a significant reduction in DAI at 1 week after DSS treatment. Additionally, it led to an increase in body weight and food intake within 1 day at 3 or 6 days, as well as a decrease in the colon weight-to-dry weight ratio. ZnNPs also exhibited a reduction in IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in the serum, while increasing IL-10 levels at 7 days. Moreover, it reduced GSH-Px, DAO, MDA, and MPO efficacies in the colon. More investigations revealed that ZnNPs prevented significantly ICAM-1 and NF-κB levels in colon tissue. This research provides evidence that ZnNPs possess high protective efficacies on DSS-induced acute enteritis in animals by their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.}

Specifically, it includes a decentralized and non-repudiable solution for the autonomous scenario of the industrial cluster Industrial Internet, promoting the transformation of the network into a self-adjusting and self-managing distributed network, enhancing the credibility of the platform, and reducing the negative impact of distrust and information asymmetry; it proposes three models (private chain, alliance chain, and public chain) for the integration of blockchain and the Industrial Internet, providing a secure and reliable support platform for the development of industrial clusters, solving the problem of information asymmetry, promoting trust and synergy, and maximizing the synergistic effect; from the perspective of security and reliability, it deeply analyzes the industrial cluster network platform, proposes a trusted framework, and realizes the data layer and application layer of the network with the help of blockchain technology. The experimental results show that these models meet the requirements of the industrial cluster in terms of data privacy, control, and credibility and have a positive significance for promoting the development and digital transformation of the industrial cluster.}

abstract = {The current social reality is characterized by all-encompassing change, which disrupts existing social structures at all levels. Yet the approach based on the ontological primacy of stable and often hierarchical structures is still prevalent in theoretical and, most importantly, practical thinking about social systems. We propose a conceptual framework for thinking about a dynamically changing social system: the Living Cognitive Society. Importantly, we show how it follows from a much broader philosophical framework, guided by the theory of individuation, which emphasizes the importance of relationships and interactive processes in the evolution of a system. The framework addresses society as a living cognitive system – an ecology of interacting social subsystems – each of which is also a living cognitive system. We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work. We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research – distributed social governance – which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on stable structures within global society.}

Blockchain technologies vary depending on their openness, consensus algorithms, and use cases. Cryptoassets are one application for monetary and financial purposes, and they have expanded dramatically in number and market capitalization. In the form of Initial Coin Offerings and Token Sales, cryptoassets have had large impacts in start-up financing, competing with Venture Capital. Beyond cryptoassets, the range of use cases expanded dramatically through smart contracts, and blockchain technologies are currently used in managing identity, personal data, elections, supply chains, energy grids, property registries, and Internet of Things. Blockchain's novelty and design pose regulatory challenges about data protection, illicit uses, geographic delimitation of competent jurisdictions, and how to enforce judicial decision on ostensibly immutable ledgers. Blockchain technologies offer a fertile ground to explore issues of trust, power, identity, ownership, and value. Geographic research can unpack blockchain's potentialities and ambiguities for disintermediation and reintermediation, decentralization and control, co-production and capitalization. It can also look into the economic geographies of blockchain firms, the environmental and energetic footprint of distributed calculation.}

abstract = {Context:
Previous studies have shown that existing deep learning-based approaches can significantly improve the performance of vulnerability detection. They represent code in various forms and mine vulnerability features with deep learning models. However, the differences of code representation forms and deep learning models make various approaches still have some limitations. In practice, their false-positive rate (FPR) and false-negative rate (FNR) are still high.
Objective:
To address the limitations of existing deep learning-based vulnerability detection approaches, we propose BGNN4VD (Bidirectional Graph Neural Network for Vulnerability Detection), a vulnerability detection approach by constructing a Bidirectional Graph Neural-Network (BGNN).
Method:
In Phase 1, we extract the syntax and semantic information of source code through abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG), and data flow graph (DFG). Then in Phase 2, we use vectorized source code as input to Bidirectional Graph Neural-Network (BGNN). In Phase 3, we learn the different features between vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code by introducing backward edges on the basis of traditional Graph Neural-Network (GNN). Finally in Phase 4, a Convolutional Neural-Network (CNN) is used to further extract features and detect vulnerabilities through a classifier.
Results:
We evaluate BGNN4VD on four popular C/C++ projects from NVD and GitHub, and compare it with four state-of-the-art (Flawfinder, RATS, SySeVR, and VUDDY) vulnerab ility detection approaches. Experiment results show that, when compared these baselines, BGNN4VD achieves 4.9%, 11.0%, and 8.4% improvement in F1-measure, accuracy and precision, respectively.
Conclusion:
The proposed BGNN4VD achieves a higher precision and accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, when applied on the latest vulnerabilities reported by CVE, BGNN4VD can still achieve a precision at 45.1%, which demonstrates the feasibility of BGNN4VD in practical application.}

Despite offering various services, the integration and seamless data exchange among different modes of transportation remain challenging. To address this, research was conducted to examine the current state of integration in the MOD ecosystem, identify gaps in data exchange, and propose policy considerations. The research highlighted the limited integration and inconsistent data structures in the United States (U.S.), attributed to the absence of policy directives and high costs of traditional standards development. Industry-led initiatives are driving progress in standards and specifications. Deep linking and deep integration were distinguished, emphasizing the importance of a truly user-centric MOD solution. Emerging mobility models leveraging blockchain technology show promise in facilitating efficient data sharing and collaboration among various operators. Transportation policy makers play a crucial role in supporting open-source standards and integration efforts. An initial framework utilizing open-source efforts such as Transport Operator Mobility-as-a-service Provider (TOMP), Mobility Data Specification (MDS), General On-demand Feed Specification (GOFS), Transactional Data Specification (TDS), Operational Data Standard (ODS), and City Data Standard for Mobility (CDS-M) was proposed to drive the advancement of scalable and user-centric MOD systems.}

Riding on the magnanimous promises of the blockchain secure validation mechanism and decentralized mass collaboration, cryptocurrencies are the newest asset class being introduced to investors worldwide and are being used by companies to raise capital to further their development of the advancement of blockchain technology via ICOs. The substantial inflow of unregulated capital into a transactional and transnational industry has aroused interest from not just investors but also national securities and monetary regulatory agencies. In this chapter, we explore the potential for blockchain to exacerbate the already decentralized economy. We review the Securities and Exchange Commission’s initial statements on ICOs to illustrate the potential problems with applying a dated legal framework to an ever-evolving ecosystem. Recognizing the inability of enforcement within existing regulatory frameworks, we argue for the regulation of the crypto asset class and internal collaboration between government agencies and developers in the establishment of an ecosystem that integrates investor protection and investment.}

abstract = {The contactless micromanipulation capability and microgravity environment provided by the acoustic levitation technology have excellent application prospects in many fields, such as droplet dynamics, solidification state physics, life sciences, etc. However, the applications are severely constrained by the limitation of the transducer power. In this paper, we explore an array geometry optimization framework to improve the levitation capability. First, the acoustic pressure attenuation and directional characteristics of commercial transducers are analyzed to uncover the mechanism of the array geometry affecting the acoustic radiation force (ARF). Second, based on the Gor'kov potential theory, the array geometry form of N-elements is derived, and the arrangement in the spherical ring (ASR) method is proposed to obtain the element coordinates. Then, spherical radius and array height are adjusted to obtain the optimal array geometry. On this basis, the directional angle of each transducer is further optimized. Finally, simulation and physical verification are carried out. The simulation results indicate that the ARF increases and then decreases with the spherical radius and array height, which are the existing maximum values. Directional angle optimization (DAO) can improve the ARF, particularly when the array height exceeds the sphere diameter. These findings are consistent with the analytical results. Notably, we built a prototype physical system, and the physical experiments showed that the optimized array improved the axial ARF by 201.2% and the radial ARF by 115.9% over the conventional array. The works presented in this paper offer a valuable design approach for acoustic levitation arrays, thereby contributing to the advancement and application of ultrasonic array levitation technology.}

The alternative finance industry leverages innovative technologies, such as direct lending, crowdfunding, automated wealth management, on-demand insurance, and digital currencies. This feature aligns well with the DeFi principles, and it is also beneficial to CeFi. Distributed ledger platforms offer transparency and security for both DeFi and CeFi, whereas future payment technologies provide user-friendly solutions. This study applies novel wavelet and quantile cross-spectral coherence analyses to obtain nuanced relationship insights. This methodology categorizes crypto finance into the DeFi and broader cryptocurrency ecosystems to facilitate robust comparison with traditional banking. It further delineates democratized banking into alternative financing mechanisms, distributed ledger technologies, and future payment capabilities. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals time–frequency associations, whereas quantile cross-spectral coherence unveils extreme connections under different market conditions. The findings suggest the existence of dynamic relationships between inclusive banking components and various financial infrastructures. These relationships vary across return distributions and time scales. In regular markets, positive associations are seen in yearly and monthly frequency cycles with alternative finance and centralized services exhibiting the strongest linkage. During periods of extremely high returns, CeFi and centralized-decentralized (hybrid) infrastructures exhibit limited interconnectivity with democratized banking. Moreover, DeFi's association with distributed ledger technology is negligible. In bear markets, the strongest positive associations are observed between inclusive access and conventional, hybrid, and decentralized financial systems. These insights provide new perspectives on the dynamics between financial systems during extreme conditions. This study emphasizes the need for adaptive regulation, international cooperation, and a balance between innovation and stability to protect and empower users. Collaboration between academia and policymakers is essential to navigate this evolving landscape and advance democratized banking.}

To explore the pathological mechanism of intestinal mucosal barrier injury of LIDHS and the protection of YJP, the LIDHS rat model was established through imitating the inducing conditions of LIDHS and treated with YJP. The integrity of ileal and colonic mucosa was detected through histopathological examination. The serum DAO, D-LA and ET levels were detected by ELISA. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Occludin, ZO-1 and MUC2 in ileum and colon were detected using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry methods, respectively. The results showed that the ileal and colonic epithelium of LIDHS rats were destroyed; the serum DAO, D-LA and ET levels were significantly increased; the mRNA and protein expression levels of Occludin, ZO-1 and MUC2 in ileum and colon were all abnormally expressed. After treatment with YJP, the mucosal integrity was restored; the levels of serum DAO, D-LA and ET, mRNA and protein levels of Occludin and ZO-1 in ileum and colon and MUC2 in ileum were back-regulated; however, MUC2 level in colon was further increased. The results demonstrated that the intestinal mucosal barrier was damaged in LIDHS rats and Occludin, ZO-1 and MUC2 were abnormally expressed, and YJP could repair the intestinal mucosal barrier through up-regulating the expression of Occludin and ZO-1 in ileum and colon as well as MUC2 in colon and down-regulating MUC2 in ileum.}

FTIR, Raman, and TEM methods demonstrate that GO was successfully synthesized and grafted with diaminoalkanes. TGA analysis revealed that DAH-GO and DAO-GO are more stable than GO. The effect of temperature and concentration on the inhibitors’ efficiency was also studied. The inhibition efficiency of DAH-GO increased with concentration, reaching a maximum of 82% while that of DAO-GO reaches a maximum of around 86% at a concentration of 5 ppm for both. The inhibitors performed well at an extremely low concentration at the temperatures tested, however as the temperature rises, the inhibitor’s performance reduces. The inhibitors function mostly as an inhibitor of the mixed kind, according to the potentiodynamic polarization measurement. The examined compounds were found to follow the Langmuir adsorption theory. DFT calculations were used to estimate the relative stability of functionalized GOs to GO and to understand the nature of the inhibitor molecules’ interactions with the steel surface. The results obtained from the DFT calculations supported the experimental results. Because GO was made from scrap graphite, this work is critical in addressing major environmental concerns: corrosion and waste management.}

The paper outlines two core problems, which were inspired by recent legislative activities in Belarus and Russia. The first is a possible displacement of existing legal regimes of objects of civil rights by the legal regime of the token. Secondly, the problem of definition of the nature of rights to tokens arises (in rem versus ad personam) as well as remedies for their violations. Provisions of the Belarus Decree “On the development of digital economy” of 21 December 2017 and drafts of the laws on blockchain and ICO, discussed in Russian Parliament and Government are taken to illustrate these problems.}

We study intraorganizational blockchains from an agency perspective to understand how the distributed, sequenced, and consensus-based nature of blockchains mitigates information asymmetries and affects organizational structures. First, we explain how blockchains differ from conventional relational, contractual, and system-based mechanisms to address three pertinent information challenges—concentration, continuity, and conflict. Subsequently, we address the consequences of introducing such blockchains, arguing that they create both direct and sequenced information channels among principals and agents, which elicit an organizational reconfiguration via vertical disintermediation and lateral reintermediation. Finally, we theorize the implications of blockchain-based organizing for agency theory regarding the chain of command, the unity of direction, and the span of control. Overall, we show how blockchains for intraorganizational governance can mitigate principal-agent problems and impact organizational design in profound ways.}

abstract = {With the advent of blockchain technology, new Online Social Networks (OSNs) were proposed under the name of Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM). Among the most well-known BOSMs, the introduction of blockchain is geared towards providing a decentralised social platform, together with an auditable and transparent rewarding system. While some current BOSMs have gathered a large set of dedicated users, they can hardly fight against the hegemony of the most well known centralised platforms, such as Twitter or Facebook. Yup tries to overcome this issue by proposing a rewarding system that can integrate with existing platforms. Its rewarding system keeps track of any piece of content uniquely identified by an URL, so its usage is not restricted to OSNs only. Given its unique approach, its rewarding system represents an important case study that, to the best of our knowledge, is not covered in the literature. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting the rewarding system provided by Yup and understanding its implications on the social activity of the users. Our analyses uncover that the voting activity favours the creation of echo chambers, and that the rewarding system is unfair. Additionally, we identify some limitations that can help design new rewarding systems.}

Security is one of the key challenges of a smart city. One can enable smart cities with a blockchain to offer enhanced security via storing transactions in a secure, transparent, decentralized, and immutable ledger. However, both blockchain and smart cities are in their infancy and significant research efforts are needed to integrate them. In this paper, we comprehensively review the role of blockchain in enabling IoT-based smart cities. First, we present the evolution of blockchain technology in terms of constituent technologies, consensus algorithms, and blockchain platforms. Second, we discuss and critically evaluate various smart applications enabled by blockchain. Third, we present real-world blockchain implementation in smart cities as case studies. Fourth, we present the key requirements to integrate blockchain with smart cities. Finally, we present open research challenges along with their key causes and possible solutions.}

It plays a decisive role in enhancing the quality of decision-making and operational efficiency. However, the storage and authenticity verification of large-scale IoT real-time data present unprecedented technical challenges. Faced with the inherent data security risks of traditional centralized cloud storage, blockchain technology reveals its unique potential for solutions with its inherent immutability and decentralization. Nevertheless, current blockchain-based data storage solutions are still restricted by high costs and inefficiency. To address these challenges, this paper innovatively proposes the BI-TSFID framework, which leverages the benefits of Ethereum and IPFS and optimizes the Merkle Tree structure and verification mechanisms. The BI-TSFID framework adopts a strategy of on-chain data summary storage and off-chain computation. This approach provides IoT with efficient and reliable data storage, reduces operational costs, and simplifies the verification process. This research has improved the data computation efficiency by refining the structure of the Merkle Tree and analyzed its optimal branch number. Additionally, the study introduces a sampling-based data integrity verification method that significantly reduces resource consumption during the verification process. Experimental results show that the solutions proposed in this paper effectively enhance the efficiency and security of IoT data management and provide valuable guidance for the theory and practice of real-time data storage and verification, further promoting the development and innovation in the related technological fields.}

The study was undertaken in two stages: (i) interviews in 2016 that examine the barriers and drivers of diffusion; followed by (ii) a case study in 2019 of the Italian wine industry’s permissioned blockchain. The results show that diffusion is reaching a final stage for permissionless blockchains but is lagging behind for permissioned blockchains due to the different barriers and drivers of diffusion. The implications from this study are that: (i) drivers and barriers for different types of technological innovation may be different and change over time; (ii) initial barriers may be surmounted and become features of the underlying technology; (iii) barriers may become drivers of a technology; (iv) drivers of one type of technology may spill-over to become drivers for another type; (v) diffusion may be measured by both the number of adoptions and the number of participants in that technology; (vi) off-chain processes may become a major barrier for permissioned blockchains; and finally (vii) self-interest may be the key driver of technological innovation.}

However, IoT suffers from many limitations like energy, resource constraints, scalability, security, availability, etc. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another similar technology that has many features that are capable of solving many of the limitations of the conventional IoT system. So, suitably incorporating SDN technology into the conventional IoT system, an improved version of IoT namely an SDN-based IoT network system has been evolved. This system is capable of resolving many of the limitations of IoT. Since this newer SDN-based IoT version is enriched with better energy and resources, it can undertake higher computational loads to resolve security issues. In the security domain, Blockchain is a state-of-the-art security-based technology in recent times which has already been implemented in the fields of cryptocurrency effectively. So, Many research opportunities emerge out in adapting Blockchain-based technology suitable for the SDN-based IoT Networking domain. This paper deals with the investigations carried out by the past researchers on various security aspects of the IoT, SDN, and SDN-based IoT systems and their solutions using various technologies, including that of Blockchain. It was concluded that the convergence of Blockchain in IoT and SDN and its combination (SDN-based IoT) resolved many security issues. Many prominent research gaps still persist here to be resolved. This can be dealt with as a future scope of research opportunities in the domain.}

abstract = {Some of the major challenges facing rice researchers are how to improve yield and also increase the aroma content of fragrant rice. It has been established that light and Nitrogen (N) management affect the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) in fragrant rice. However, the ability of N to improve yield in fragrant rice and improve its 2AP content has not been established. Nevertheless, N promotes rice growth and improves rice yield, which has the ability to compensate for the negative impact of low light on fragrant rice yield. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of N application rates on rice yield and 2AP accumulation under shading conditions. Field experiments were conducted between May and September from 2019 to 2021. The experiments were conducted in ambient light condition (AL) and low light condition (LL); using four different levels of N－0 kg N ha−1 (N0), 20 kg N ha−1 (N1), 40 kg N ha−1(N2),and 60 kg N ha−1 (N3)－which were applied during the booting stage. The grain yield, 2AP content, photosynthetic related indicators, N content in rice, Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, antioxidant enzyme activity and the biochemical parameters related to 2AP formation were all investigated. Our results showed that shading reduced yield by 5.00 % and increased 2AP content by 23.40 %. In addition, shading reduced net photosynthetic rate (Pn), leaf area index (LAI), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and N content in rice, and increased proline, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C), proline dehydrogenase (PDH), △1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS), malondialdehyde (MDA). Although increased N application levels increased the yield, 2AP, Pn, LAI, proline, P5C, GABA, PDH, P5CS, SOD, CAT, POD and N content of rice, the ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), diamine oxidase (DAO) and MDA levels all decreased. The findings of this study showed that shading increased 2AP content of fragrant rice, but reduced its yield. However, increase in N application under shading conditions increased both the biosynthesis of 2AP and yield in rice.}

Indeed, blockchain consortia often lost development focus due to high system complexity and a lack of understanding of how to create a system that will serve the needs and bring value to all stakeholders. Thus, stakeholders struggled to leverage blockchain information systems' full value. Prior studies demonstrated that blockchain systems pose not only technical but also organizational challenges. Analysing six blockchain consortia, we identify their value mechanisms, organizational problems, and organizational solutions that successful blockchain consortia experience while organizing themselves for value. As a result, we propose a new organizational form, i.e., a layered organization, for blockchain consortia to achieve better value creation.}

More specifically, the microcarbon residue (MCR) content, the colloidal instability index (CII), the stability index (SI), and the Heithaus parameter (P value) were employed. The catalytic hydrocracking of heavy oils was carried out in a slurry-phase semi-batch reactor at 410 °C under 110 bar of hydrogen and in the presence of a Mo-octoate precursor (1000 wppm). The correlation between the feedstock properties (i.e., the MCR content and the CII) and the reaction performance in the upgrading process was established. It was found that feedstocks with higher MCR contents also contained greater numbers of aromatic components and shorter alkyl side chains, resulting in a higher tendency for coke formation and a lower yield of de-asphalted oil (DAO). Stability evaluation showed that stable feedstocks tended to produce less coke, greater DAO yields, and lower amounts of impurities compared to unstable feedstocks. In addition, it was revealed that the CII was sensitive to the reaction performance, suggesting that improving the stabilities of asphaltenes by means of the solvency effect is the key to obtaining high product quality.}

This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects.

abstract = {Keeping in view of the constraints and challenges with respect to big data analytics along with security and privacy preservation for 5G and B5G applications, the integration of machine learning and blockchain, two of the most promising technologies of the modern era is inevitable. In comparison to the traditional centralized techniques for security and privacy preservation, blockchain uses decentralized consensus algorithms for verification and validation of different transactions which are supposed to become an integral part of blockchain network. Starting with the existing literature survey, we introduce the basic concepts of blockchain and machine learning in this article. Then, we presented a comprehensive taxonomy for integration of blockchain and machine learning in an IoT environment. We also explored federated learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning algorithms usage in blockchain based applications. Finally, we provide recommendations for future use cases of these emerging technologies in 5G and B5G technologies.}

The attacks on RPL are partly studied in the literature, and the proposed solutions typically overlook the appropriate trade-off among the detection rate and communication and computational overhead. This study aimed at introducing a new attack called Dropped Destination Advertisement Object (DDAO) and a new Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to counter this attack in RPL protocol. DDAO attack adversely affects the network by preventing the creation of the downward routes through not forwarding Destination Advertisement Object (DAO) messages and sending fake Destination Advertisement Object Acknowledgment (DAO-ACK) messages to the DAO source. A distributed lightweight IDS is proposed in this study to detect and counter DDAO attacks by monitoring the behavior of parents against forwarded DAO messages. According to the evaluations conducted on the Cooja simulator under different real-world conditions, the proposed IDS can detect DDAO attacks with high accuracy, precision, and True Positive Rate (TPR) and low False Positive Rate (i.e., close to zero). Additionally, compared to RPL, the proposed IDS improves Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) by 158 percent when countering attacks.}

To demonstrate this utility, this paper uses a futures-oriented scoping review of technology-enhanced money laundering and terrorist financing risks as an example. At the forefront of the proposed modifications is a quality assessment framework assessing reviewed publications for their neutrality, evidence, relevance and clarity (NERC). This proposed framework is not only ideal for appraising publications but also as an indication of likelihood, namely whether their discussed insights constitute possible, plausible or probable alternative futures. The validity of the NERC framework in achieving these aims is assessed successfully through statistical correlation tests. The overall aim of this paper is to motivate the proposed modifications, the NERC framework and (modified) scoping reviews more generally as a formidable tool for informing horizon scanning, decision-making and pre-emptive policy development.}

abstract = {Background
Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is associated with decreased exercise capacity despite successful repair. Altered flow patterns have been identified due to abnormal aortic arch geometry. Our previous work demonstrated aorta size mismatch to be associated with exercise intolerance in this population. In this study, we studied aortic flow patterns during simulations of exercise in repaired CoA using 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) using aortic replicas connected to an in vitro flow pump and correlated findings with exercise stress test results to identify biomarkers of exercise intolerance.
Methods
Patients with CoA repair were retrospectively analyzed after CMR and exercise stress test. Each aorta was manually segmented and 3D printed. Pressure gradient measurements from ascending aorta (AAo) to descending aorta (DAo) and 4D flow CMR were performed during simulations of rest and exercise using a mock circulatory flow loop. Changes in wall shear stress (WSS) and secondary flow formation (vorticity and helicity) from rest to exercise were quantified, as well as estimated DAo Reynolds number. Parameters were correlated with percent predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) and aorta size mismatch (DAAo/DDAo).
Results
Fifteen patients were identified (VO2max 47 to 126% predicted). Pressure gradient did not correlate with VO2max at rest or exercise. VO2max correlated positively with the change in peak vorticity (R = 0.55, p = 0.03), peak helicity (R = 0.54, p = 0.04), peak WSS in the AAo (R = 0.68, p = 0.005) and negatively with peak WSS in the DAo (R = − 0.57, p = 0.03) from rest to exercise. DAAo/DDAo correlated strongly with change in vorticity (R = − 0.38, p = 0.01), helicity (R = − 0.66, p = 0.007), and WSS in the AAo (R = − 0.73, p = 0.002) and DAo (R = 0.58, p = 0.02). Estimated DAo Reynolds number negatively correlated with VO2max for exercise (R = − 0.59, p = 0.02), but not rest (R = − 0.28, p = 0.31). Visualization of streamline patterns demonstrated more secondary flow formation in aortic arches with better exercise capacity, larger DAo, and lower Reynolds number.
Conclusions
There are important associations between secondary flow characteristics and exercise capacity in repaired CoA that are not captured by traditional pressure gradient, likely due to increased turbulence and inefficient flow. These 4D flow CMR parameters are a target of investigation to identify optimal aortic arch geometry and improve long term clinical outcomes after CoA repair.}

In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) maintains users’ assets by smart contracts in a decentralized manner, but introduces additional overhead in terms of gas fee and transaction confirmation latency. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the benefits of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is criticized for two issues. First, trading transactions are time-consuming and expensive for frequent token traders. Second, excessive simultaneous transactions might cause the pending transaction congestion in the Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate the pending transaction congestion. Besides, we propose the very first gas-price vs. transaction-confirmation-latency function to guide Ethereum transaction issuers to choose an optimal gas price that minimizes the overall cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the cost in the proposed HEX with that in the conventional HEX. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing gas fees and transaction confirmation latency for frequent traders as well as the pending transaction congestion in Ethereum.}

For this, the paper reviews: (1) the governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions. The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature. Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence. The findings show the potential of blockchain-based governance to overcome institutional barriers related to trust-building and enhanced coordination for community-based energy transitions.}

This study presents an approach for interlinking BIM and GIS data for a semantic pedestrian network using semantic web technologies. The proposed approach automatically converts BIM and GIS data into linked data and establishes interlinkages between BIM and GIS data through semantic queries and inferences. The resulting semantic pedestrian network based on integrated linked data graphs forms a knowledge base, including topological and geometrical information and abundant semantic information from BIM and GIS datasets. The application potential of the semantic pedestrian network is demonstrated through information query and semantic route planning.

Blockchain has the potential to shake the foundation of e-commerce by enabling exchange relations that are trustless and operate without dedicated intermediaries or even central authorities in the case of permissionless blockchains. Furthermore, the exchange of information and value between companies and consumers might change considerably by enabling unified access to immutable data along the entire supply chain.

FinTech has proven its true potential in traditional financial offerings by delivering digital financial services to individuals worldwide. The pandemic has accelerated how people interact with financial services and has resulted in long-term changes to societies and economies. FinTech has expanded access to financial services and has made such changes possible. FinTech or Financial Technology refers to using new technologies for financial services. Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and cloud computing are a few technologies currently being applied to FinTech. In this paper, we consider FinTech, which partly uses blockchain technology. Blockchain technology plays a vital role in the financial sector as it ultimately lifts trust and the need for third-party verification by using consensus-based verification. This survey provides a comprehensive summary of the most relevant blockchain-based FinTech implementations and an overview of FinTech sectors and segments. For each segment, we provide a critique and a discussion on how each blockchain implementation contributes to solving the majority of problems faced by FinTech companies and researchers. This research aims to direct the future of financial solutions by providing an outline of the applications of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology (DLT) for FinTech. We discuss various implementations, limitations, and challenges of blockchain-based FinTech applications. We conclude this work by exploring possible strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis and future research directions.}

Herein, diamine-oxidase (DAO) and soybean peroxidase (SBP) were immobilized onto silica spherical monoliths (prepared from biowaste-derived substances) to realize a practical and fast enzymatic system, able to quantify biogenic amines in solution. The mechanism consisted in the oxidation of amines by DAO with the formation of H2O2, which in turn activated the SBP reaction producing an indamine dye. The amount of amine was indirectly determined by the spectroscopic measurement of the final product. Preliminary kinetic tests on DAO/SBP catalytic system using histamine as DAO substrate showed the maximum activity at pH 8. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized monoliths over several reaction cycles and their catalytic action towards cadaverine, tyramine, tyrosine and histamine were studied. The results showed that the immobilized DAO/SBP system was effective in the determination of different substrates for many cycles, reaching a detection limit comparable to chromatographic methods.}
