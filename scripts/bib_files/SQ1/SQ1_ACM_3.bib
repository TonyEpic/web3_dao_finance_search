abstract = {In recent years, edge-based smart unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery systems have attracted a lot of attention by both academia and industry given its promising business value and also as an ideal testbed for many emerging technologies such as edge computing, blockchain and machine learning. At the moment, one of the critical challenges for smart UAV delivery systems is data privacy since the massive amount of data is being generated by both users and UAVs and the data is used for training machine learning models to support various smart applications such as autonomous navigation, facial recognition, and person re-identification (ReID). To tackle such a challenge, federated learning (FL) has been widely used as a promising solution since it only needs to share and update model parameters with the centralised server without transmitting the raw data. However, conventional FL still faces the issue of the single-point-of-failure. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose BDFL, a Blockchain-enabled decentralised FL framework for edge-based smart UAV delivery systems. In our framework, Blockchain provides a decentralised network for FL to eliminate the need for a centralised server and store private data in the decentralised permissioned Blockchain to avoid the single-point-of-failure. To motivate our study and analyse the privacy concerns, we employ the person ReID application in smart UAV delivery systems as a typical example. In addition, we also provide the customised proof of quality factor (cPoQF) consensus protocol to address the scalability issue of the Blockchain in order to support the increasing number of smart applications in UAV delivery system. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through experiments on energy efficiency, confirmation time and throughput, with further discussion on the impact of the incentive mechanism, and the analysis of its resiliency under various security attacks.},

abstract = {The sharing economy, the business of collectively using privately owned objects and services, has fuelled some of the fastest growing businesses of the past years. However, popular sharing platforms like Airbnb or Uber exhibit several drawbacks: a cumbersome sign up procedure, lack of participant privacy, overbearing terms and conditions, and significant fees for users. We demonstrate a Decentralised App (DAPP) for the sharing of everyday objects based on a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract enables users to register and rent devices without involvement of a Trusted Third Party (TTP), disclosure of any personal information or prior sign up to the service. With increasing distribution of cryptocurrencies the use of smart contracts such as proposed in this paper has the potential to revolutionise the sharing economy.},

Among these, DDoS attacks are a growing concern in IoT. Such attacks are executed through the introduction of rogue devices and then using them and/or other compromised devices to facilitate DDoS attacks by generating relentless traffic. This paper aims to address DDoS security issues in IoT by proposing an integration of IoT devices with blockchain. This paper uses Ethereum, a blockchain variant, with smart contracts to replace the traditional centralized IoT infrastructure with a decentralized one. IoT devices are then required to access the network using smart contracts. The integration of IoT with Ethereum not only prevents rogue devices from gaining access to the server but also addresses DDoS attacks by using static resource allocation for devices.},

abstract = {In migrating and upgrading an Ethereum smart contract, it is necessary to transfer both the code as well as the stored data. Various methods attempt to migrate or upgrade a smart contract, but they are mostly manual, error-prone, and applicable only before deployment. Further, they have challenges in extracting the storage state of complex mapping data structures along with their keys. In this work, we present Smartmuv as an automatic source-code-based static analysis tool to analyze and extract the state from the storage-trie of smart contracts. Based on the abstract syntax tree and the control flow graphs of the Solidity source code, the tool analyzes each state variable including mapping types along the inheritance hierarchy. It also provides the upgrade algorithm that initializes the extracted state in the constructor of new smart contract. Smartmuv safely approximates the origin of the keys used in the mapping to extract values and has been able to extract the mapping state of 23,673 smart contracts with 95.7\% overall precision. Moreover, we also validate the Smartmuv’s extracted state with the third-party tool Etherscan.},

abstract = {Decentralized and distributed blockchain technology has superior potential. Quorum, as a permissioned blockchain platform, provides enhanced privacy and performance that are suitable for enterprise needs. Cloud, as the infrastructure for Quorum-based blockchain, is vulnerable to failures. Failures originating from errors need to be tolerated through improved reliability and fault-tolerance procedures. Fault-tolerance and reliability are still challenging to implement in cloud infrastructure for Quorum-based blockchain networks. This research focuses on implementing fault-tolerance mechanisms in the provisioning of Quorum-based blockchain in a cloud environment. The research explores the use of hybrid fault tolerance by adopting a combination of reactive protocol, namely replication, and proactive protocol, namely monitoring. The replication protocol creates data redundancy with reactive treatment performed in case of failures, ensuring data availability even in failure conditions. The monitoring protocol provides real-time monitoring of the blockchain network's condition and performance, enabling proactive detection and mitigation of system failures. Overall, this research utilizes automation in its operational processes. It employs tools such as Amazon Web Services, Quorum, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and Truffle. The research design and implementation are divided into cloud infrastructure, blockchain network, and interface. The research testing results demonstrate that the system infrastructure is capable of achieving fault tolerance using replication and monitoring protocols, as well as making transactions within the blockchain network.},

abstract = {At present, some colleges and universities use the recruitment system to complete the registration and review of candidates in the recruitment work, but the review work still requires reviewers to spend a lot of time to complete. In addition, candidates submit malicious incorrect registration information to disrupt recruitment, which not only increases the workload of reviewers, but also affects the efficiency of recruitment. Candidates need to upload scanned copies of certification materials (such as ID card, degree certificate, graduation certificate, etc.) when registering. Some candidates are worried about whether the information will be leaked and the reviewers are unfair in reviewing for personal gains. In response to these problems, this article proposes to add text recognition to the recruitment management system of a university teacher to complete the system's automatic registration review. Based on the traceability and non-tampering characteristics of blockchain technology, the security and traceability of registration information are guaranteed. Kind of optimization plan. By analyzing the system process, selecting a third-party API interface to complete text recognition, and combining the simple filtering function of the system to build an automated audit function of the system. Select the candidate's registration information as the traceability object, optimize the system process, write smart contracts, web3.js connect the system and the blockchain. Experiments have proved that the automated audit function is automatically executed after candidates submit the registration form, and the average audit speed is 550ms. Reduce the workload of reviewers and improve recruitment efficiency. If the candidate has questions about the review process, the candidate can retrospectively verify whether the registration information has been tampered with through the blockchain, which ensures the fairness of the recruitment work.},

abstract = {The popularity of blockchain technology led to the development of many web platforms with different functionalities. Ethereum, a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contracts, introduces an interesting ecosystem of human users and autonomous agents (the contracts). It is the most actively used blockchain platform, hosting ether, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as its native store of value. The Ethereum blockchain contains a vast amount of user-to-user, user-to-contract, contract-to -user, and contract-to-contract interactions that can be modeled as complex networks. To mine these interactions as graphs through a preferred analytics toolbox, an end-user has to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the required data into the desired network format. However, it is costly and time-consuming to manage the ETL pipeline for the massive and complex blockchain data. To support research in this domain, we develop an end-to-end, automated tool - EtherNet, which performs ETL tasks from a single source of truth (Google BigQuery), and provides graph equivalent representations for visualization and mining on the entire Ethereum blockchain network.},

Concurrently, consumers can readily explore the energy options available and make purchases according to their individual preferences while taking into consideration the location of the offered energy and voltage compatibility. In addition, we provide a comparison between a centralized traditional market and our proposed solution, identifying that the cost of deploying and operating ANKA is less than the centralized approach.},

Recently, several research works performed graph analysis on the publicly available blockchain data to reveal insights into its business transactions and for critical downstream tasks, e.g., cryptocurrency price prediction, phishing scams and counterfeit token detection. In this tutorial, we discuss relevant literature on blockchain data structures, storage, categories, data extraction and graphs construction, graph mining, topological data analysis, and machine learning methods used, target applications, and the new insights revealed by them, aiming towards providing a clear view of unified graph-data models for UTXO and account-based blockchains.

Performance evaluation of the proposed technique is crucial for feasible implementation in blockchain-based social media applications. The community-driven moderation technique on speed, cost, and user satisfaction is tested on the Polygon blockchain. The results indicate the cost of between 51,112 and 719,999 gas units. The average response time is 5.083 seconds, and the average gas fee is 4.2E-8 Matic.

Different access control systems have been proposed for different IoT environments, many are remaining only at a conceptual level. In this paper, we propose a decentralized, ledger-based, publish-subscribe based architecture for the administration of access in a smart home IoT environment to preside at the assignments of underlying operational authorizations. Proposed architecture is endorsed by a proof-of-concept implementation, which utilizes smart contracts to ensure the integrity of administration supplemented by intrinsic benefits of blockchain to be distributed and transparent. Despite the rising hype around the blockchain technology that stokes its utilization in different domains, utilizing it for access control purposes is not yet promising. Our implementation results assure using blockchain for administrative access control is propitious, while is not yet appropriate for operational access control, which have been mainly the focus of previously proposed blockchain-based access control works.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a carrier of unique identity as a virtual currency. Its indivisible, unique, and verifiable characteristics can truly reflect personal assets and virtual assets to a certain extent. It is widely applied by users in art, games, collectibles and other areas. NFT is stored on the blockchain. The user's digital signature is embedded into the NFT record, which is distributed through a smart contract and verified by the blockchain consensus mechanism, thus solving the problem of identity confirmation in digital asset transactions. This paper makes a review of the main processes and key technologies in NFT applications. First, it introduces the life of NFT: minting, distribution, storage and circulation. Then, the key technologies of NFT are explained, including the blockchain smart contracts and consensus mechanisms in NFT distribution and transaction, the token standards that the minting and transaction process of NFT needs to use, and the important role of NFT in the field of web3. Finally, through the evaluation system of NFT, the problems existing in the current NFT applications and the future research direction are drawn out.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the concept of blockchain soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their implementation in Ethereum-based blockchains. Soulbound tokens add an important piece to blockchain technology, as they could be the key to building Web3 and a trustworthy decentralized society. Issued and strictly linked to an account, representing the soul of a user, the soulbound token makes it possible to represent a property that only the user can have and that cannot be transferred, but only removed, which enhances security. To evaluate their impact on blockchain development, we first examine the concept of soulbound tokens, their potential applications, and their effective adoption. The application sectors include the creation of digital identity certificates, ownership certificates, reputational certificates, governance, and the healthcare sector. We then report and describe relevant blockchain token standards, including soulbound token standards, provided in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals. Finally, to study the efficacy of the implementation of soulbound tokens, we propose a case study that includes the design and development of a decentralized vaccine certification prototype based on soulbound tokens. In our system, the vaccination data produced by the health authority is fully decentralized and implemented as the issuance of soulbound tokens for the benefit of a citizen's soul account. As a result, the citizen is the only owner of the vaccination data.},

abstract = {Governance issues limit blockchains' ability to evolve and face unforeseen challenges. It seems possible to argue that this impasse is because most blockchains lack meta-rules. This work considers blockchains as a socio-technical system of rules, in order to draw a comparison with legal systems. Following the comparison, one finds that most blockchains lack what, in legal theory, are considered secondary rules. That is, the meta-rule of the system.This works examines the relevant concepts and provides their definitions, then proceeds to outline concrete example of the failure of governance among popular blockchains before drawing the parallelism with legal systems and argue that secondary rules might solve some of the issues of the governance of blockchains.Secondary rules are the necessary infrastructure for building sound governance structures and a necessary condition for blockchains to succeed as a new mode of governance. The conclusion provides future research directions.},

abstract = {The design of tokenomics, i.e., distribution and circulation mechanisms of cryptocurrency tokens, is a top priority for almost all Web3 applications which relates to their own economic systems via native cryptocurrency tokens. Unfortunately, while the sustainability of tokenomics largely determines the long-term development of a Web3 application, the tooling support for the design of it has been far too insufficient. A common practice at the time of writing is to specify tokenomics with a combination of documents, spreadsheets, code scripts etc.. In this paper, we introduce the TMI development platform for the modelling and analysis of Web3 tokenomics. TMI creates a domain-specific language and its graphical development environment for developers to succinctly model crypto-economic relations in a drag-and-drop way. Based on created models, TMI allows developers to formally analyse their tokenomics via checking fundamental economic properties, e.g., The core team of a project holds less than 20\% of the project token in 36 months. A demonstration video of TMI is available at https://youtu.be/LDn-eRxPMTw.},

abstract = {The Non Fungible Tokens are assets that have exploded wisely in recent years. One area where NFTs are yet to impact is in pet's life. Therefore, an NFT Marketplace for pets can be created so that pets can be embraced. This marketplace allows customers to list, sell, and buy NFTs. Marketplace will contain images or videos of pets as NFTs, that will be uploaded by the owner of the pet. There will also be a listing amount that can be mentioned by the owner and also it will have a minimum value of 0.01ETH. This value can be increased by the owner according to his/her interest. There will be several benefits to using NFTs as pets will get a secure environment and health care. The user can register to the marketplace with his Web3 wallet. This paper explains that these NFTs can be used to store and track important information about pets, such as their health records, and ownership. Owners or users will be able to develop their interest in the marketplace as it provides a gamified view. This marketplace will help in maintaining transparency and help owners to get informed about their pet's related vital information.},

abstract = {For the sake of enhancing repurchase rate and customer loyalty, plenty of enterprises have issued reward points. However, as there are more enterprises issuing reward points, customers become less and less interested to collect them. Even though there are companies forming a business alliance to make reward points more attractive, it is usually managed by a central leading company. In other words, there still exists a security concern for a centralized system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based cross-organizational integrated platform (BCOIP) for issuing and redeeming reward points. BCOIP provides customers an electronic reward point system that is easier to collect and manage and could circulate in many enterprises. Besides, since BCOIP deploys the smart contract to operate the reward point and make all point transactions stored on the permissioned blockchain, it provides more interoperability and security to enterprises and more credibility for costumers. Moreover, goods providers joining the BCOIP could not only improve the diversity of the reward market but also reach more costumers. Finally, we conduct two experiments to evaluate the efficiency and stability of the BCOIP. Results indicate that points transactions are stable regardless of the number of parallel processes and the other shows the number of nodes has nothing to do with the efficiency of this system.},

abstract = {Traditionally, top-level domains (TLDs) are managed by the Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (ICANN), and the domain names under them are managed by registrars. Against such a centralized management, a blockchain naming service (BNS) has been proposed to manage TLDs on blockchains without authority intervention. BNS users can register TLD strings as non-fungible tokens and manage the TLD root zone. However, such a decentralized management results in the introduction of a new security issue, BNS TLD name collision, wherein the same TLD is registered in several different BNSs. In this study, we investigated BNS TLD name collisions by analyzing TLDs registered on two BNSs: Handshake and Decentraweb. Specifically, we collected TLDs registered in Handshake and Decentraweb and the associated data, and analyzed the data registration status of BNS TLDs and BNS TLD name collisions. The analysis of 11,595,406 Handshake and 11,889 Decentraweb TLDs revealed 6,973 BNS TLD name collisions. In particular, lastname TLDs, which are intended for use as person names, yielded a large number of registered domain names. In addition, the analysis identified 10 name collisions between the BNS and operational ICANN TLDs. Further, the ICANN TLD candidates under review also had name collisions against the BNS TLDs. Consequently, based on the characteristics of these name collisions and discussions in BNS communities, we considered countermeasures against BNS TLD name collisions. For the further development of BNSs, we believe that it is essential to discuss with the existing Internet communities and coexist with the existing Internet.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a complex network comprising interconnected devices that transmit their data via the Internet. Due to their open environment, limited computation power, and absence of built-in security, IoT environments are susceptible to various cyberattacks. Denial of service (DDoS) attacks are among the most destructive types of threats. The Multi-vector DDoS attack is a contemporary and formidable form of DDoS wherein the attacker employs a collection of compromised IoT devices as zombies to initiate numerous DDoS attacks against a target server. A Blockchain-based Operational Threat Intelligence framework, OTI-IoT, is proposed in this article to counter multi-vector DDoS attacks in IoT networks. A “Prevent-then-Detect” methodology was utilized to deploy the OTI-IoT framework in two distinct stages. During Phase 1, the consortium Blockchain network validators employ the IPS module, composed of a smart contract for attack prevention and access control, and Proof of Voting consensus, to thwart attacks. Validators are outfitted with deep learning-based IDS instances to detect multi-vector DDoS attacks during Phase 2. Alert messages are generated by the IDS module’s alert generation and propagation smart contract in response to identifying malicious IoT sources. The feedback loop from the IDS module to the IPS module prevents incoming traffic from malicious sources. The proposed OTI framework capabilities are realized as an outcome of combining and storing the outcomes of the IDS and IPS modules on the consortium Blockchain. Each validator maintains a shared ledger containing information regarding threat sources to ensure robust security, transparency, and integrity. The operational execution of OTI-IoT occurs on an individual Ethereum Blockchain. The empirical findings indicate that our proposed framework is most suitable for real-time applications due to its ability to lower attack detection time, decreased block validation time, and higher attack prevention rate.},

Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Blockchain is undoubtedly one of the most potentially attractive technologies for the organization of financial services. The significance of the Blockchain technology in a banking system can be determined by three main principles that is; Disintermediation, Transparency and Provenance. The DLT (distributed ledger technology) eliminates the need for trust enforcer in the banking management system. This is made possible by the tamper- proof data in the distributed data records and all the participants in the network have the same version of data record with them at all times and it is unalterable. Blockchain promotes a public database record of all the customer transactions and other data, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy system as the customers have a 24x7 real-time access to it. Blockchain keeps an immutable distributed data ledger of transactions and this result in maintaining a lifecycle of the assets and its ownership from its first transaction to the most recent one. It reduces the chances of occurrence of theft, insurance fraud and misselling of the high valued assets or intellectual properties. Blockchain can be implemented in the banking sector for various applications like maintenance of data confidentiality, cheque clearing system, real time money transfer system (digital currency), supply chain finance, insurance, trade finance, KYC (know your customer), cross-border payments/transactions system, monitoring of consortium accounts, auction system and digital asset management. Blockchain technology can hence enable a decentralized solution for the banking ecosystem. The proposed system enables one platform for both the lenders and the borrowers to initiate their money transaction for lending, borrowing and repayment of the loan money. The transactions made throughout, that is, from the start to the last repayment can be viewed easily on a blockchain network thus increasing the transparency and trust of the customers and it resolves any disputes that can arise in the loan system. Along with this, a KYC registry based on blockchain is also proposed which will help in maintaining the KYC details in one platform which can be accessed by various banks for identification and verification of the customer in an easy and faster manner. It will increase the customer satisfaction as there will be no need for the customer to perform a KYC check every time he/she creates a bank account in any bank as the bank can easily access their KYC details from this system.},

Its societal impact has important repercussions both on social good and on social computing. Among the technologies that are driving the metaverse, we find cryptocurrencies and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that are used to represent the property of goods and assets in the virtual worlds. In particular, NFTs are used to represent the parcels in which the metaverse is divided, with unknown consequences on the metaverse economy. In this paper, we explore the social impact of employing NFTs in the metaverse and propose an analysis of parcel sales taking Decentraland and The Sandbox as a case study. Our analysis uncovers that prices of the metaverse parcels are increasing over time and that acquiring parcels is becoming prohibitive. Additionally, we identify that the factors that drive the price of sales in the metaverse are the proximity to specific landmarks, like roads, squares, districts, or parcels owned by influencers or enterprises. We argue that this could be a factor in reducing the social good of the metaverse because it fuels a speculative market similar to the one of the physical estate.},

abstract = {A blockchain is designed to make consistent and reliable agreement in an unreliable and decentralized environment. It also permits processing transactions, making smart contracts, which allows end users to perform the contracts without any intermediate entities. However, there are some challenges in retrieving the state in a smart contract on the blockchain. For example, an external database or user-defined data structures can be used to retrieve the data from a smart contract in a range, which can increase the management overhead and decrease the overall performance of the blockchain system. In this paper, we propose a scheme that enables SQL query operations in a blockchain system. In our proposed scheme, the register and query managers provide fast retrieval of range data without any user-defined data structure, and management at low cost without any external database, respectively. We have implemented our scheme on quorum which is an Ethereum-based blockchain system and evaluated it using a synthetic benchmark. The experimental results show that our system can improve the search performance up to about 22x compared with the existing system with low memory usage.},

To clear the fog, this article accordingly provides a comprehensive review of the current progress of blockchain interoperability. We explore the general principles and procedures for interoperable blockchain systems to highlight their design commons. Then, we survey practical instances and compare state-of-the-art systems to present their unique features between distinct solutions.

We explored contemporary challenges of owning digital things, and the extent to which NFTs, and 'Web3' technologies offer meaningful forms of ownership. Our findings describe how the inability to trade this NFT, and its unique circumstances of acquisition, made it meaningful in ways that extended beyond its immediate (limited) utility and offered participants something through which to construct identity. Reflecting on the aspirations, contradictions, and misconceptions of forms of ownership enabled by NFTs, we conclude with proposals for renewed attention in HCI to the nature of digital possessions, and the potential for 'ownership design'.},

abstract = {Although China has initially entered the era of comprehensive well-off by 2020, there are still many remote rural areas in China that are lagging behind in development and the living standards of farmers are below the poverty line. Local governments at all levels, enterprises and institutions actively respond to the national policy of targeted poverty alleviation (TPA), through precise counterpart support, promotion and sales of agricultural products, to achieve the purpose of helping farmers in remote areas to get rid of poverty. In order to further tap the poverty alleviation potential of the whole society and accelerate the goal of poverty alleviation, this paper proposes and designs a Consumer to Farmer (C2F) platform, based on "decentralized" blockchain technology, to build a direct link between consumers and farmers. By adopting the form of multi-nodes to build a federation chain, and at the same time combining smart contract technology to design and develop a decentralizedblockchain-based TPA platform. Through the roadmap of consumers purchasing and paying in advance for agricultural products, farmers produce and deliver the ordered agricultural products, achieving a win-win outcome for both consumers and farmers. The C2F platform is therefore of great relevance as a complement to government-led TPA.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is being deployed in industry, public services, and even homes. These devices are making information more available and allow for greater automation and efficiencies. With the rapid growth this industry is experiencing, the security of IoT devices has not been given the attention it needs. Many of these devices leave sensitive information exposed or may allow for malicious actors to take control of them. The Internet of Things uses a vast range of hardware which has led to many different approaches to security. Administering a network with such variability makes it easy for insecure configurations to be overlooked.This paper proposes the use of blockchain technology as the backbone to a security framework to unify IoT devices of varying resource constraints under one system. Ethereum is used to create a secure system that is Denial of Service resistant, store encryption keys, store encrypted data, and manage trust of devices. Using the Proof-of-Authority consensus method instead of the more common Proof-of-Work, allows for more efficient use of resources. This system features mechanisms to include the use of LoRa LPWAN technology, which is often used in IoT. Tests were run on a small network of devices while recording processor utilization. Latencies were also measured, showing that devices with fewer resources showed significant latencies, and suggestions as to how these latencies can be reduced are proposed.},

abstract = {With the development of information technology in the era of big data, the traditional education model based on offline courses can no longer meet people's needs. Online education (i.e., E-Learning) has become a new type of education model. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, collective maintenance, data disclosure, non-tampering and so on. Its characteristics make it an ideal solution for the existing problems of online education. In this paper, we proposed a new type of decentralized system which called ELMarket(ELM), aiming to solving the problems and deficiencies of existing online educational platforms, including that student user power is insufficient, participants are not interactive enough, and the copyright of educational resources is not protected well.ELM is based on Ethereum to build a private chain called "Intelligence Chain". We released circulating tokens which called ELStone(ELS) on the "Intelligence Chain" as an incentive to users. The system also proposed and widely applied the concept of "Smart Market". In order to protect teachers' creative rights and stimulate students' interests in learning, we have also added several mechanisms such as originality detection, review of users’ behavior and credits exchange. In addition, we combine IPFS and relational database to store, making up for the lack that blockchain cannot store large files. In the end, ELM established a safe, transparent, efficient, and non-tamperable online education ecosystem.},

abstract = {Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.},

abstract = {User migration, i.e. the movement of large sets of users from one online social platform to another one, is one of the main phenomena occurring in modern online social networks and even involves the most recent alternative paradigms of online social networks, such as blockchain online social networks (BOSNs). In these platforms, user migration mainly occurs through hard forks of the supporting blockchain, i.e. a split of the original blockchain and the creation of an alternative blockchain, to which users may decide to migrate. However, our understanding of user migration and its mechanisms is still limited, particularly regarding the role of densely connected user groups (communities) during migration and fork events. Are there differences between users who stay and those who decide to leave, in terms of network structure and discussion topics? In this work, we show, through network-based analysis centered on the identification of communities on multilayer networks and text mining that a) the “position” of a group within the network of social and economic interactions is connected to the likelihood of a group to migrate, i.e. marginal groups are more likely to leave; b) group network structure is also important, as users in densely connected groups interacting through monetary transactions are more likely to stay; c) users who leave are characterized by different discussion topics; and d) user groups interacting through monetary transactions show interest in migration-related content if they are going to leave. These findings highlight the importance of social and economic relationships between users during a user migration caused by fork events In general, in the larger context of online social media, it motivates the need to investigate user migration through a network-inspired approach based on groups and specific subgraphs while leveraging user-generated content, at the same time.},

abstract = {Shared code in blockchains, known as smart contracts, stands to replace important parts of our digital governance and financial infrastructure. The permissionless execution of smart contracts is tightly coupled to cryptocurrencies and Proof-of-Work blockchains. As a result, smart contracts inherit the environmental impact of Proof-of-Work blockchains, such as its energy consumption, carbon footprint, and electronic waste. The four concepts of relaxed consistency, strong identities, probabilistic consensus, and the use of liabilities instead of assets may change the status quo. This work explores the integration of these concepts to decouple smart contracts from Proof-of-Work blockchains. By means of a local-first approach, which may expose users to inconsistent ephemeral contract states, the architecture of smart contracts can be transformed to become green. Because such contract states may be dropped, we base the interactions between users on liabilities. We propose a novel paradigm for smart contract architectures, named Green Smart Contracts, that is based on a local-first approach. Furthermore, we present and implement a prototype solution for this paradigm. We validate the need for a mechanism to resolve consistency violations by replaying the contract calls of a real smart contract. Our simulation shows that violations occur more often (13\% of contract invocations) when using liabilities than when using a traditional blockchain (3\% of contract invocations). However, we additionally validate that they can be avoided using a consensus mechanism, and our experiments show that a publish-subscribe messaging pattern uses the fewest messages to do so, though it may not be applicable for use cases that disallow the inherent imbalance in the messaging between peers. Our carbon emission estimation shows that a Green Smart Contract approach lowers carbon emissions by 52.31\% when compared with the messaging behavior of a typical peer-to-peer blockchain with 1000 nodes.},

abstract = {Ethereum has established itself as a highly decentralized and reliable blockchain network and serves as the de facto standard. However, using public blockchains in enterprise applications can be challenging due to concerns about confidentiality and transaction finality. As a result, consortium and private blockchains, which limit participation to specific nodes, are also commonly used. But these consortium blockchains also have limitations, such as limited node participation due to performance constraints imposed by the consensus algorithm. In this study, by using ZK-rollups as a messaging means, we would connect consortium blockchains via public Ethereum as a hub. We examined a mechanism to balance both mathematically reliable interoperability and maintaining the secrecy of the information and the finality. The concept was actually implemented, to confirm the interoperability of simple money transfer transactions. And also, the way to handle secret information and the finality was theoretically organized.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is a new way to compute in the cloud that further simplifies the user's management burden and allows the user to focus on its core business. Most existing FaaS systems are centralized, i.e., the infrastructure is owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. This character brings a few limitations. For instance, an end user will be bound with a specific cloud service provider and there is a risk of single point of failure. In order to mitigate these limitations, a natural idea is to build a decentralized FaaS system. In this paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system that uses blockchain technology and decentralized API management to build a decentralized FaaS system, which enables greater scalability, flexibility, improved security, and reliability. Specifically, DeFaaS uses a blockchain to create a decentralized registry of available functions (services) and manage their execution. An application interacts with the blockchain to discover and invoke functions securely and transparently. In addition to providing a reliable and scalable platform for decentralized FaaS, DeFaaS can support other distributed computing scenarios, such as dApps, volunteer computing, and multi-cloud service mesh. Overall, our proposed system represents a significant advance in the field of decentralized computing and has the potential to enable a wide range of exciting new applications and use cases.},

The problems of traceability, non-counterfeiting and unique usage of digital coupons fall within this area; many couponing platforms are hence exploring the possibility of addressing the above limitations with blockchain technologies. In view of the foregoing, in this work we analyse and compare several blockchain-based couponing systems. To do so, we first propose a general schema of digital coupon and define the desirable properties of a couponing system. Then, we select a sample of these systems and we examine them, describing their design choices and summarizing their relevant properties. Finally, we inspect their code and study how the notion of couponing system is interpreted in their smart contracts. We also highlight their distinctive features and relevant implementation solutions. We conclude by discussing what emerged from our analysis and proposing some possible future investigations.},

abstract = {The ecosystem inherent within currently deployed Internet of Things (IoT) systems is that of low-powered devices equipped with sensors that consume data. The data these devices collect is then stored in use-case specific applications, which are connected through application layer gateways that allow these devices to connect to third party cloud storage platforms for further processing. This stratified architecture has created data silos that introduce complexities such as limited user control and lack of solicitation regarding the usage of user data. The constant proliferation of IoT devices deployed in smart cities which include smart university campus (SUC) has resulted in the need for the development of IoT architecture models which are data-centric. In this paper a blockchain- based architecture model, and specifically, the distributed ledger inherent within the Ethereum blockchain, combined with the Proof Of Authority (POA) consensus mechanism, are proposed as a potential solution to developing a proof of concept architecture model that is data-centric. The proposed architecture model will be tested against with application specific use-cases in a simulated environment within the context of a SUC which is subsumed by a smart city.},

abstract = {With the widespread popularity of the Internet of Things and various intelligent medical devices, the amount of medical data is rising sharply, and thus medical data processing has become increasingly challenging. Mobile edge computing technology allows computing power to be allocated at the edge closer to users, which enables efficient data offloading for healthcare systems. However, existing studies on medical data offloading seldom guarantee effective data privacy and security. Moreover, the research equipping data offloading architectures with Blockchain neglect the delay and energy consumption costs incurred in using Blockchain technology for medical data offloading. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a data offloading scheme for healthcare based on Blockchain technology, which achieves optimal medical resource allocation and simultaneously minimizes the cost of offloading tasks. Specifically, we design a smart contract to ensure secure data offloading. And, we formulate the cost problem as a Markov Decision Process, solved by a policy search-based deep reinforcement learning (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) scheme, where we jointly consider offloading decisions, allocation of computing resources and radio transmission bandwidth, and Blockchain data security audits. The security of our smart-contract-based mechanism is theoretically and empirically proved, while extensive experimental results also show that our solution can obtain superior performance gains with lower cost than other baselines.},
