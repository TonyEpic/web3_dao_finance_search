abstract = {The explosive growth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Web3 has created a new frontier for digital art and collectibles and an emerging space for fraudulent activities. This study provides an in-depth analysis of NFT rug pulls, the fraudulent schemes that steal investors’ funds. From a curated dataset of 760 rug pulls across 10 NFT marketplaces, we examine these schemes’ structural and behavioral properties, identify the characteristics and motivations of rug pullers, and classify NFT projects into 20 groups based on creators’ association with their accounts. Our findings reveal that repeated rug pulls account for a significant proportion of the rise in NFT-related cryptocurrency crimes, with one NFT creator attempting 37 rug pulls within 3 months. Additionally, we identify the largest group of creators influencing the majority of rug pulls and demonstrate the connection between rug pullers of different NFT projects using the same wallets to store and move money. Our study contributes to understanding NFT market risks and provides insights for designing preventative strategies to mitigate future losses.},

abstract = {In this work we propose Dynamit, a monitoring framework to detect reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. The novelty of our framework is that it relies only on transaction metadata and balance data from the blockchain system; our approach requires no domain knowledge, code instrumentation, or special execution environment. Dynamit extracts features from transaction data and uses a machine learning model to classify transactions as benign or harmful. Therefore, not only can we find the contracts that are vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, but we also get an execution trace that reproduces the attack. Using a random forest classifier, our model achieved more than 90 percent accuracy on 105 transactions, showing the potential of our technique.},

abstract = {In recent years, cryptocurrencies have increasingly gained interest. The underlying technology, Blockchain, shifts the responsibility for securing assets to the end-user and requires them to manage their (private) keys. Little attention has been given to how cryptocurrency users handle the challenges of key management in practice and how they select the tools to do so. To close this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=10). Our thematic analysis revealed prominent themes surrounding motivation, risk assessment, and coin management tool usage in practice. We found that the choice of tools is driven by how users assess and balance the key risks that can lead to loss: the risk of (1) human error, (2) betrayal, and (3) malicious attacks. We derive a model, explaining how risk assessment and intended usage drive the decision which tools to use. Our work is complemented by discussing design implications for building systems for the crypto economy.},

abstract = {Recently, the Ethereum blockchain changed its consensus algorithm from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This change has greatly reduced overall energy consumption but has paved the way for the profiling of numerous mechanisms and actors that can operate off-chain to achieve Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). This raises questions about how transparent such a scenario is, both from the point of view of block validation power and from the point of view of the rewards achieved by distinct actors within the platform. To address this concern and to mitigate potential negative externalities, a permissionless ecosystem has recently been proposed that should be transparent and fair for the extraction of MEV. In this article, after briefly describing the new ecosystem, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Ethereum blocks and other information about the actors operating in the ecosystem, to highlight potential critical situations.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions among users  
on top of a peer-to-peer network. Among all, Ethereum is the most popular  
general-purpose platform and its support of smart contracts led to a new  
form of applications called decentralized applications (DApps). A typical  
DApp has an off-chain frontend and on-chain backend architecture, and the  
frontend often needs interactions with the backend network, e.g., to  
acquire chain data or make transactions. Therefore, Ethereum nodes implement  
the official RPC specification and expose a uniform set of RPC methods to  
the frontend. However, the specification is not sufficient in two points:  
(1) lack of clarification for non-deterministic event handling, and  
(2) lack of specification for invalid arguments. To effectively disclose  
any deviations caused by the insufficiency, this paper introduces  
EtherDiffer that automatically performs differential testing on four major  
node implementations in terms of their RPC services. EtherDiffer first  
generates a non-deterministic chain by multi-concurrent transactions and  
propagation delay. Then, it applies our key techniques called  
property-based generation and type-preserving mutation to generate  
both semantically-valid and semantically-invalid-yet-executable test  
cases. EtherDiffer executes the test cases on target nodes and reports  
any deviations in error handling or return values. The evaluation showed  
the effectiveness of our test case generation techniques with the success  
ratios of 98.8\% and 95.4\%, respectively. Also, EtherDiffer detected  
48 different classes of deviations including 11 implementation bugs  
such as crash and denial-of-service bugs. We reported 44 of the detected  
classes to the specification and node developers and received  
acknowledgements as well as bug patches. Lastly, it significantly  
outperformed the official node testing tool in every technical aspect.  
We believe that our research findings can contribute to more stable  
DApp ecosystem by reducing the inconsistencies among nodes.},

abstract = {DNS has often been criticized for inherent design flaws, which make the system vulnerable to attack. Further, domain names are not fully controlled by users, meaning that they can easily be taken down by authorities and registrars. Due to this, there have been efforts to build a decentralized name service that gives greater control to domain owners. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a major example. Yet, no existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, particularly regarding security and misbehavior. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement study of ENS. Our findings suggest that ENS has shown growth during its four years' evolution. We identify several security issues, including traditional name system problems, as well as new issues introduced by the unique properties of ENS. We find that attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS names, a number of scam blockchain addresses and indexing of malicious websites. We further develop a new record persistence attack, to find that 22,716 .eth names (3.7\% of all names) are vulnerable to name hijacking. Our exploration suggests that our community should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of issues in decentralized name services.},

abstract = {The recent development of payment channels and their extensions (e.g., state channels) provides a promising scalability solution for blockchains which allows untrusting parties to transact off-chain and resolve potential disputes via on-chain smart contracts. To protect participants who have no constant access to the blockchain, a watching service named as watchtower is proposed -- a third-party entity obligated to monitor channel states (on behalf of the participants) and correct them on-chain if necessary. Unfortunately, currently proposed watchtower schemes suffer from multiple security and efficiency drawbacks.In this paper, we explore the design space behind watchtowers. We propose a novel watching service named as fail-safe watchtowers. In contrast to prior proposed watching services, our fail-safe watchtower does not watch on-chain smart contracts constantly. Instead, it only sends a single on-chain message periodically confirming or denying the final states of channels being closed. Our watchtowers can easily handle a large number of channels, are privacy-preserving, and fail-safe tolerating multiple attack vectors. Furthermore, we show that watchtowers (in general) may be an option economically unjustified for multiple payment scenarios and we introduce a simple, yet powerful concept of short-lived assertions which can mitigate misbehaving parties in these scenarios.},

It serves as a trust intermediary in several industries, including finance, insurance, and supply chain management, in the blockchain 2.0 era. With the increasing interest in smart contracts, security has become a serious problem. Examining typical vulnerability types and vulnerability detection methodologies is of special importance. In this research, a comprehensive evaluation of common smart contract security vulnerabilities is conducted, and a three-tier threat model is then provided to classify the vulnerabilities. In addition, we examine fourteen existing smart contract analysis tools for finding vulnerabilities and classify them according to the main technique they apply. This paper is designed to serve as a reference for people who wish to analyse deployed code and enhance existing detection techniques. At the conclusion, open issues and future research paths regarding smart contract vulnerability detection are presented.},

abstract = {In the past, the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)” was used to refer to a loosely organized network of autonomous entities, such as a corporation, a cooperative, or a non-profit party. Since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs. The EVM can also run other applications such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a new type of blcokchain-based organization that uses smart contracts to perform tasks on a distributed scale. The smart contracts have organizational rules and operational logic embedded and automatically execute organizational decisions and proposals making it highly decentralized and more democratic. The DAOs are organizations that are not subject to legal, physical, or economic constraints, as well as the ability to operate outside the control of a single central authority or a single governing body. Because DAO is formed by many smart contract that operate together, which makes it highly decentralized and has a strong democratic system. This paper discusses the pros and cons of DAO, and the potential of DAO in community development, especially in non-profit organizations. It is hope to provide an overall picture of DAO, and the roadmap for future development of DAO on the right track.},

abstract = {Smart contracts enable developers to run instructions on blockchains (eg. Ethereum) and have broad range of real-world applications. Solidity is the most popular high-level smart contract programming language on Ethereum. Coding in such language, however, demands a user to be proficient in contract programming and debugging to construct smart contracts correctly. In practice, such expectation makes it harder for non-programmers to take advantage of smart contracts. In this demonstration, we present a novel visual smart contract construction system on Ethereum called latte to make smart contract development accessible to non-programmers. Specifically, it allows a user to construct a contract without writing Solidity code by manipulating visual objects in a direct manipulation-based interface. Furthermore, latte interactively guides users and makes them aware of the cost (in units of Gas) of visual actions undertaken by them during contract construction.},

abstract = {Privacy concerns of smart contracts are a major roadblock preventing their wider adoption. A promising approach to protect private data is hiding it with cryptographic primitives and then enforcing correctness of state updates by Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) proofs. Unfortunately, NIZK statements are less expressive than smart contracts, forcing developers to keep some functionality in the contract. This results in scattered logic, split across contract code and NIZK statements, with unclear privacy guarantees. To address these problems, we present the zkay language, which introduces privacy types defining owners of private values. zkay contracts are statically type checked to (i) ensure they are realizable using NIZK proofs and (ii) prevent unintended information leaks. Moreover, the logic of zkay contracts is easy to follow by just ignoring privacy types. To enforce zkay contracts, we automatically transform them into contracts equivalent in terms of privacy and functionality, yet executable on public blockchains. We evaluated our approach on a proof-of-concept implementation generating Solidity contracts and implemented 10 interesting example contracts in zkay. Our results indicate that zkay is practical: On-chain cost for executing the transformed contracts is around 1M gas per transaction (~0.50US$) and off-chain cost is moderate.},

Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

We analyze the case where a trusted third party (TTP) is optimistically available, although we emphasize that the trust put on the TTP is only regarding the fairness, and our protocols preserve the privacy of the exchanged items against the TTP. In the fair SMPC case, we prove that a malicious TTP can only harm fairness, but not security.We construct an asymptotically optimal multi-party fair exchange protocol that requires a constant number of rounds (in comparison to linear) and O(n2) messages (in comparison to cubic), where n is the number of participating parties. In our protocol, we enable the parties to efficiently exchange any item that can be efficiently put into a verifiable encryption (e.g., signatures on a contract). We show how to apply this protocol on top of any SMPC protocol to achieve fairness with very little overhead (independent of the circuit size). We then generalize our protocol to efficiently handle any exchange topology (participants exchange items with arbitrary other participants). Our protocol guarantees fairness in its strongest sense: even if all n-1 other participants are malicious and colluding with each other, the fairness is still guaranteed.},

abstract = {Web3 is progressively decentralising Internet services with the introduction of the blockchain, from social networks to online trading. Filecoin is a Web3 storage marketplace implemented on top of the Interplanetary File System that aims at decentralising storage by rewarding users who pledge storage to the system. Clients form deals with storage miners, who store deals on the Filecoin blockchain for transparency and auditability. Storage miners can also obtain extra rewards when they mine a block. In this paper, we show that although Filecoin aims at complete decentralisation, the rewarding system acts as the opposite. We download a dataset composed of 47.5M messages and expose that most of the blocks are created by the same storage miners, who are also the ones that pledge more storage. An analysis of their identity shows that they belong to cloud companies, that have a lot of extra storage resources. The effect observed is due to the fact that storage miners are able to commit all extra storage to the system, even when there are no deals in them. Additionally, this effect is further intensified by recent updates to Filecoin, which let storage miners update committed storage to deal-containing storage effortlessly.},

Through interviews with 24 users, we explore reasons for selecting wallets in different contexts. Participants opt for smart contract wallets to simplify key management, leveraging social interactions. However, they prefer personal devices over individuals as guardians to avoid social cybersecurity concerns in managing guardian relationships. When engaging in high-stakes or complex transactions, they often choose browser-based wallets, leveraging third-party security extensions. For simpler transactions, they prefer the convenience of mobile wallets. Many participants avoid hardware wallets due to usability issues and security concerns with respect to key recovery service provided by manufacturer and phishing attacks. Social networks play a dual role: participants seek security advice from friends, but also express security concerns in soliciting this help. We offer novel insights into how and why users adopt specific wallets. We also discuss design recommendations for future wallet technologies based on our findings.},

Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures, and systems related to economic systems. When investigating those state-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in mind: (1) What is the framework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse? and (2) What activities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to disclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and the future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic system framework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements in the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital trading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed economic system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary systems, digital wallets, decentralized finance activities, and cross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly discuss three questions: (a) the rationale of this topic, (b) why the metaverse needs this topic, and (c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through this overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the metaverse needs and the insights behind the economic activities in the metaverse.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) became part of everyday life for many people around the world. They are one of the main channels through which information can spread at lightning speed. Thanks to this fact, people use them for the most disparate reasons, such as sources of information in place of newspapers, to receive emotional or technical support, or to share their ideas and opinions to satisfy their need for sociality.Since their introduction, people questioned these services because they are affected by several problems. These problems include the preservation of the users' privacy, fake news diffusion, diffusion of illegal pieces of content, censorship vs free speech, economic value redistribution, security vs trust, and so on. The aim of this workshop is to partially try to overcome these problems by setting up a platform for researchers to publish their contributions.The contributions can point to innovative methods and algorithms for social graph mining, which can be helpful to develop more efficient information diffusion techniques; the problem of privacy, and how can be enforced in these systems is current, and in particular the relation between security, trust and privacy is crucial in the scenario of OSNs; the decentralisation and its impact on the implementation of social services; how Artificial Intelligence techniques that respect the privacy of the users can be implemented; technologies that enable the metaverse.},

abstract = {Recently, Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) experiences renewed research interest with the rise of novel BFT SMR-based distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In DLTs, BFT SMR is used as a core primitive for maintaining a consistent append-only log by committing blocks of transactions in all replicas. In comparison with Proof-of-Work, BFT can typically improve performance and energy efficiency and comes with proven system properties.BFT protocols can be used to create resilient infrastructures, but still open research questions exist and deserve further investigation. For instance, one major ongoing challenge is currently to make "traditional" BFT applicable to practical, large-scale environments. Another challenge is to assert that the BFT system suffices other requirements necessary for a practical deployment, e.g., being resilient to performance degradation or liveness-endangering attacks.The high level goal of this PhD project consists in analyzing how BFT can be optimized by making it adaptive towards its environment such as system size or geographic dispersion of replicas while hardening the resilience of the system.},

Since most smart contracts are not annotated with formal specifications, general verification of functional properties is impeded. In this work, we propose an automated approach to verify unannotated smart contracts against specifications ascribed to a few manually-annotated contracts. In particular, we propose a notion of behavioral refinement, which implies inheritance of functional properties. Furthermore, we propose an automated approach to inductive proof, by synthesizing simulation relations on the states of related contracts. Empirically, we demonstrate that behavioral simulations can be synthesized automatically for several ubiquitous classes like tokens, auctions, and escrow, thus enabling the verification of unannotated contracts against functional specifications.},

abstract = {The control, governance, and management of the web have become increasingly centralised, resulting in security, privacy, and censorship concerns. Decentralised initiatives have emerged to address these issues, beginning with decentralised file systems. These systems have gained popularity, with major platforms serving millions of content requests daily. Complementing the file systems are decentralised search engines and name-registry infrastructures, together forming the basis of a decentralised web. This survey article analyses research trends and emerging technologies for content retrieval on the decentralised web, encompassing both academic literature and industrial projects.Several challenges hinder the realisation of a fully decentralised web. Achieving comparable performance to centralised systems without compromising decentralisation is a key challenge. Hybrid infrastructures, blending centralised components with verifiability mechanisms, show promise to improve decentralised initiatives. While decentralised file systems have seen more mature deployments, they still face challenges such as usability, performance, privacy, and content moderation. Integrating these systems with decentralised name-registries offers a potential for improved usability with human-readable and persistent names for content. Further research is needed to address security concerns in decentralised name-registries and enhance governance and crypto-economic incentive mechanisms.},

abstract = {We identify a subtle security issue that impacts mechanism design in scenarios in which agents can absolutely commit to strategies, by which the strategy of an agent may depend on the commitments made by the other agents. This changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game of choosing which strategies to commit to. We say that a game that is unaffected by such commitments is Stackelberg resilient and show that computing it is intractable in general, though it can be computed efficiently for two-player games of perfect information. We show the intuitive, but technically non-trivial result, that if a game is resilient when some number of players can make commitments, it is also resilient when these commitments are available to fewer players. We demonstrate the non-triviality of Stackelberg resilience by analyzing two escrow mechanisms from the literature. These mechanisms have the same intended functionality, but we show that only one is Stackelberg resilient. Our model is particularly relevant in Web3 scenarios, where these commitments can be realized by the automated and irrevocable nature of smart contracts, and highlights an important issue in ensuring the secure design of Web3. In particular, our work suggests that smart contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks.},

Analyzing Ethereum blockchain transactions from July 2022 to June 2023, we uncovered a total of 24,901,115 visual scam incidents, which include 3,585,493 counterfeit token attacks, 21,281,749 zero-transfer attacks, and 33,873 function name attacks, orchestrated by 6,768 distinct attackers. Shockingly, over 28,414 victims fell prey to these scams, with losses surpassing 27 million USD. This alarming data underscores the pressing need for robust protective measures.

abstract = {Vulnerabilities in identity and access management (IAM) are one of the most common reasons for data breaches leading to adversarial impacts on security, privacy and compliance postures. Account breaches, incorrectly designed access control policies, weaknesses in authentication and credential management, vulnerable session management are some of the several security issues that lead to eventual compromise of the crown jewels leading to data breaches. The lifecycles of subjects and their identities, of objects and re- sources, and of the permissions and authorization policies are in- tertwined in a complex manner for each specific scenario. Often subjects, objects and permissions often are hard to be defined or isolated from each other, especially in the context of machine learn-ing. The evolution of these entities, and how their provenance is analyzed often is essential not only for forensic analysis of a breach but also should be a proactive ongoing process.  In order to manage the security issues and risks thereof, holistic end-to-end identity and access management in a secure and privacy- preserving manner is the need of yesterday, today and of the future. In the past couple of decades, we have encountered this problem time and again in various contexts in the settings of academic and industry research and in development/deployment of products, services and processes.  Three elements are the key ingredients in order to address this problem in a holistic manner: (1) graphs, (2) machine learning, and (3) decentralized computing (i.e., web3, blockchains). Further, with the advent of generative AI and large language models, the question arises about what problems they can help solve, or they can excerbate further, or what new challenges they can introduce. In this talk, I plan to delve into a discussion of the following: (a) the holistic and end-to-end nature of IAM, (b) the interplay between these three elements - graphs, machine learning, Web3 as well as generative AI, and how they can help, and (c) the research challenges that need to be addressed in order to reduce the security, privacy and compliance risks in identity and access management.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, human daily life has become deeply bound to the Internet. To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some technical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the revolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings. Finally, we explore several challenges and issues in this promising area.},

abstract = {Interplanetary Filesystem (IPFS) is one of the largest peer-to-peer filesystems in operation. The network is the default storage layer for Web3 and is being presented as a solution to the centralization of the web. In this paper, we present a large-scale, multi-modal measurement study of the IPFS network. We analyze the topology, the traffic, the content providers and the entry points from the classical Internet. Our measurements show significant centralization in the IPFS network and a high share of nodes hosted in the cloud. We also shed light on the main stakeholders in the ecosystem. We discuss key challenges that might disrupt continuing efforts to decentralize the Web and highlight multiple properties that are creating pressures toward centralization.},

abstract = {The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has recently gained considerable attention. While prior research has focused on understanding its performance characterization and application support, it remains unclear: (1) what kind of files/content are stored in IPFS, (2) who are providing these files, (3) are these files always accessible, and (4) what affects the file access performance.To answer these questions, in this paper, we perform measurement and analysis on over 4 million files associated with CIDs (content IDs) that appeared in publicly available IPFS datasets. Our results reveal the following key findings: (1) Mixed file accessibility: while IPFS is not designed for a permanent storage, accessing a non-trivial portion of files, such as those of NFTs and video streams, often requires multiple retrieval attempts, potentially blocking NFT transactions and negatively affecting the user experience. (2) Dominance of NFT (non-fungible token) and video files: about 50\% of stored files are NFT-related, followed by a large portion of video files, among which about half are pirated movies and adult content. (3) Centralization of content providers: a small number of peers (top-50), mostly cloud nodes hosted by tech companies, serve a large portion (95\%) of files, deviating from IPFS's intended design goal. (4) High variation of downloading throughput and lookup time: large file retrievals experience lower average throughput due to more overhead for resolving file chunk CIDs, and looking up files hosted by non-cloud nodes takes longer. We hope that our findings can offer valuable insights for (1) IPFS application developers to take into consideration these characteristics when building applications on top of IPFS, and (2) IPFS system developers to improve IPFS and similar systems to be developed for Web3.},

abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is considered a new vision of banking and financial services based on Peer-to-Peer technology, and in particular on the blockchain technology. Since 2020, DeFi has started to develop in the cryptocurrency markets. Then, with the increase in popularity of digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and with the launch of the Metaverse, DeFi has been introduced into the Social environment by the combination of social networking and finance in the blockchain. This new shape of DeFi has been called Social Finance (SocialFi). SocialFi can be seen as the social influence on any medium that can be tokenized, allowing to get monetary benefits from being part of SocialFi platforms. In detail, SocialFi has a special feature that is decentralized, open and user-controlled, and it started to be adopted by the communities. The main component of SocialFi is the Social token used to reward people. In this paper, we describe in detail the concept of SocialFi, and we discuss its application on future Social Media platforms.},

abstract = {Every recruitment process usually starts with shortlisting candidates based on the skills mentioned in their resumes. Candidates may try to boost their level of expertise on their resume to appear more qualified to employers, and in order to confirm their skills and experience, the company’s HR staff tries to contact the candidate’s former employers. However, this process is laborious and not very thorough. As a result, the candidates’ exaggerated remarks about their skills on resumes may result in poor hires, ultimately leading to a financial and reputational loss for the company. Therefore, in order to revamp the existing workflow, an automated system is required for skill verification in the recruitment process, which guarantees an effective hiring process in the company. In this research work, a novel system is devised and implemented for automatically verifying employees’ skills with the help of Smart Contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain. The major contribution of the proposed system is that it allows the registered companies to monitor their employees and their skills. Furthermore, the proposed system will benefit the employees registering into the system to get their skills endorsed and experiences approved. Due to the need for achieving consensus in Blockchain technology, it is harder to make fraudulent profiles. By leveraging the security and decentralization offered by blockchain technology, the companies can evaluate the skills as well as experiences of the candidates before hiring them and be sure about the information verified by the candidate’s former employers.},

abstract = {Ethereum is the first and largest blockchain that supports smart contracts. To enhance scalability and security, one major planned change of Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) is to upgrade the smart contract interpreter from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to WebAssembly (WASM). In the meanwhile, many other popular blockchains have adopted WASM. Since Ethereum hosts millions of smart contracts, it is highly desirable to automatically migrate EVM smart contracts to WASM code to foster the prosperity of the blockchain ecosystem, while inheriting the historical transactions from Ethereum. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to achieve this purpose due to the challenges in converting the EVM bytecode of smart contracts to WASM bytecode and adapting the generated WASM bytecode to the underlying blockchain environment. In particular, none of the existing tools are adequate for this task because they fail to achieve accurate translation and compatibility with the blockchain environment. In this paper, we propose a novel solution and use Eth2 as the target blockchain to demonstrate its feasibility and performance because Eth2 is highly attractive to both industry and academia. Specifically, we develop EVMBT, a novel EVM2WASM bytecode translation framework that not only ensures the fidelity of translation but also supports plugins to improve smart contracts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVMBT can successfully translate real-world smart contracts with high fidelity and low gas overhead.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are prone to various vulnerabilities, leading to substantial financial losses over time. Current analysis tools mainly target vulnerabilities with fixed control- or data-flow patterns, such as re-entrancy and integer overflow. However, a recent study on Web3 security bugs revealed that about 80\% of these bugs cannot be audited by existing tools due to the lack of domain-specific property description and checking. Given recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is worth exploring how Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) could aid in detecting logic vulnerabilities.In this paper, we propose GPTScan, the first tool combining GPT with static analysis for smart contract logic vulnerability detection. Instead of relying solely on GPT to identify vulnerabilities, which can lead to high false positives and is limited by GPT's pre-trained knowledge, we utilize GPT as a versatile code understanding tool. By breaking down each logic vulnerability type into scenarios and properties, GPTScan matches candidate vulnerabilities with GPT. To enhance accuracy, GPTScan further instructs GPT to intelligently recognize key variables and statements, which are then validated by static confirmation. Evaluation on diverse datasets with around 400 contract projects and 3K Solidity files shows that GPTScan achieves high precision (over 90\%) for token contracts and acceptable precision (57.14\%) for large projects like Web3Bugs. It effectively detects ground-truth logic vulnerabilities with a recall of over 70\%, including 9 new vulnerabilities missed by human auditors. GPTScan is fast and cost-effective, taking an average of 14.39 seconds and 0.01 USD to scan per thousand lines of Solidity code. Moreover, static confirmation helps GPTScan reduce two-thirds of false positives.},

There are risks of privacy breaches, server security breaches, and termination of operations. In addition, due to the particularity of blockchain, it cannot be used as a traditional database. Some large files and a lot of redundant data are not suitable for direct link. We propose an on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage model. We use consortium chains in conjunction with IPFS (Interplanetary File System). The proposed framework can meet the needs of all parties to share data in the case of distrust. In addition, traceability data is stored safely under the chain, which not only reduces the pressure of blockchain storage, but also meets the needs of consumers for traceability.},

abstract = {The emergence of new technologies and software engineering methodologies in the decentralised Web, referred to as Web 3.0, often requires using new approaches to supplement conventional development concepts such as object-oriented programming and design patterns. Therefore, it is essential to understand the blockchain fundamentals and modular development of distributed systems built from multiple components. This paper proposes a project-oriented teaching approach of smart contracts-based distributed applications (dApps) integrated into existing (Web 2.0) Web applications. First, we present the main overview of the Web programming course for a bachelor study program, prior knowledge requirements, and the characteristics of the lectures. Second, we define the dApp functional requirements for student projects that intend to consolidate the dApp theoretical concepts with a practical approach to complement the Web 3.0 concepts. The study of our teaching approach is based on an experiment where we thoroughly analyse performance on the course level, projects and individual students. The results indicate a high correlation between students' performance in Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 development, and a higher degree of iterative process is also associated with better-performing students. Moreover, the student project outcomes also provide a basis for possible future course improvements.},

It is easy for existing static analysis tools to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities in smart contract code. To mitigate this risk, we propose HermHD, an automated security enhancement tool that protects smart contracts on the Ethereum network. HermHD employs six obfuscation patterns that can rewrite the bytecode of a smart contract without affecting its functionality. By applying these obfuscation techniques, we aim to prevent reverse static analysis tools from cracking the contract and thereby enhance the security of smart contracts. To validate the effectiveness of HermHD, we conducted experiments on 121 smart contracts from a public dataset. 54The evaluation results demonstrate that all the protected smart contracts are resistant to two popular reverse engineering tools, and the additional gas cost incurred is minimal.},

One important reason for a lack of decentralized trust models for access control has been difficulties in referring to and accessing cryptographic key material in a decentralized fashion. This lack of a working and secure decentralized public key infrastructure could be fatal for projects like Berners-Lee’s Solid. To solve this problem, we propose repurposing the access control scheme SDSI (Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure). SDSI is a long-standing and well-studied alternative to the hierarchical PKI infrastructure, but it failed to be adopted due to problems with key discovery and revocation, both of which can be solved with blockchain technology. In this concept note, we outline the next steps for how SDSI could be used as a decentralized trust model using blockchain technology.},

This paper studies the security of the RPC interface in several cryptocurrency wallets.

The attacks are closely related to server and client impersonation on computer networks but occur inside the computer. The malicious process may be created by another authenticated but unprivileged user on the same computer or even by the guest user. The main contribution of this paper is to raise awareness among wallet developers about the need to protect local RPC channels with the same prudence as network connections. We also hope that it will discourage users to run security-critical applications like cryptocurrency wallets on shared systems or computers with guest account enabled.},

In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.},

As the core part of the DeFi ecosystem, decentralized lending protocols allow users to become lenders or borrowers in a completely decentralized fashion, such that an individual has complete control over their funds at all times. Collecting, analyzing, and visualizing lending data are crucial as these lending protocols are growing steadily. This paper presents an analysis model for decentralized lending protocols. Our main contributions are as follows. (i) We analyze and compare the top lending protocols; (ii) We present a general model to collect and process a large amount of data from multiple lending protocols in an exact and efficient manner; (iii) We design and implement a lending visualization system with various charts divided into three categories, i.e., lending market overview, token analysis, and user analysis.},

abstract = {The blockchain-powered decentralized applications and systems have been widely deployed in recent years. The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4\% of wallets and 83.5\% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.},

abstract = {The advent of metaverse platforms has caused a revolution in the way people interact and engage with digital content creation and consumption. These platforms employ advanced technologies like blockchain and augmented reality to provide users with a fully decentralized environment. Among the metaverse platforms, Decentraland stands out as a popular blockchain-based virtual reality platform that enables users to monetize their content creation. However, a major criticism of these platforms is the low number of active users. Existing methodologies for measuring user traffic and engagement in these metaverse platforms are often unclear and inconsistent, and recent analyses do not provide a correct evaluation of the active users. In this paper, we propose a methodology for evaluating user traffic on decentralized metaverse platforms. Our approach employs a traffic monitor that links traffic with transactions to analyze user behavior. Decentraland has been used as a case study due to its decentralized nature and transparent provision of information about user traffic. The study includes an analysis of user behavior using graph analysis, as well as an examination of user traffic and transactions. We use user traffic to measure community engagement and economic activity, and we assess value exchange through parcel transaction prices. Our analysis indicates a lower average node degree in the interaction graph compared to traditional social media, no correlation between user traffic and parcel transaction prices, the exhibition of patterns of close proximity between the dates of traffic and transactions, and the presence of four distinct user clusters based on travel patterns, with the finding that a small proportion of highly engaged users contribute significantly to the total distance travelled. This study is the first to focus on user traffic and transaction activity within a metaverse platform, and the proposed methodology can be adapted for use on comparable metaverse platforms as well.},

Therefore, if the prenatal examination data is not accurately recorded and properly preserved, it will become a source of pressure for medical staff to face disputes in the future. This research takes the prenatal examinations of pregnant as a use case. We apply robotic process automation technology to assist in the automation of prenatal examinations and blockchain technology to establish trustworthy prenatal examinations. Besides, we also use generative artificial intelligence technology to provide intelligent user-assisted consultation in open-domain question answering. The contribution of this work is to build an automated reliable prenatal examination information service to provide good care for pregnant.},

abstract = {We are currently witnessing the proliferation of blockchain environments to support a wide spectrum of corporate applications through the use of smart contracts. It is of no surprise that smart contract programming language technology constantly evolves to include not only specialized languages such as Solidity, but also general purpose languages such as GoLang and JavaScript. Furthermore, blockchain technology imposes unique challenges related to the monetary cost of deploying smart contracts, and handling roll-back issues when a smart contract fails. It is therefore evident that the complexity of systems involving smart contracts will only increase over time thus making the maintenance and evolution of such systems a very challenging task. One solution to these problems is to approach the implementation and deployment of such systems in a disciplined and automated way. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach where the structure and inter-dependencies of smart contract, as well as stakeholder objectives, are denoted by extended goal models which can then be transformed to yield Solidity code that conforms with those models. More specifically, we present first a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to denote extended goal models and second, a transformation process which allows for the Abstract Syntax Trees of such a DSL program to be transformed into Solidity smart contact source code. The transformation process ensures that the generated smart contract skeleton code yields a system that is conformant with the model, which serves as a specification of said system so that subsequent analysis, understanding, and maintenance will be easier to achieve.},

abstract = {The security and usability of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based applications depend on the secure management of cryptographic keys. However, current approaches for managing these keys often rely on third parties, trusted to be available at a minimum, and even serve as custodians in some solutions, creating single points of failure and limiting the ability of users to fully control their own assets. In this work we first revisit the problem of threshold ECDSA by considering the commonly admissible 'server-aided' model, namely, the presence of a semi-honest and non-colluding service provider. Then, we leverage that model and consider cases where that 'server' is distributed, introducing the novel concept of unstoppable wallets; hence eliminating any single point of failure. Unstoppable wallets are programmable threshold ECDSA wallets that allow users to co-sign transactions with a confidential smart contract, rather than a singular third-party. We construct highly efficient threshold ECDSA protocols that form the basis of unstoppable wallets and prove their security in the server-aided model, achieving the standard notion of fairness and robustness even in case of a dishonest majority among the signers. Our protocols minimize the write-complexity for threshold ECDSA key-generation and signing, while reducing communication and computation overhead.We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these protocols, written in a smart contract language, deployed on the Secret Network - a blockchain that plays the role of the server. Using that deployment, we showcase the protocols' applicability for two interesting applications, policy checking and wallet exchange, as well as their efficiency by demonstrating low gas costs and fees.},
