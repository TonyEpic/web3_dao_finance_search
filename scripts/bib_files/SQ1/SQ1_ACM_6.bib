abstract = {ERC-20R is a wrapper around ERC-20 that supports asset recovery within a limited time window after an asset is transferred. It is designed to reduce theft and losses on the blockchain by allowing a victim to recover their stolen or lost assets during the recovery window. When an honest recipient receives an ERC-20R asset, they must wait until the recovery windows elapses (say, 24 hours), before they can unwrap the asset back to its base ERC-20 form. We argue that many DeFi services will likely refuse to accept unsettled recoverable assets because they can interfere with their normal operations. Consequently, when Alice receives an ERC-20R token, she must wait 24 hours before she can use it with a DeFi service. But what if Alice is willing to pay a fee to exchange the wrapped token for an unwrapped ERC-20 token that can be used right away? In this paper we explore how to design a pool to exchange an unsettled ERC-20R asset for a base ERC-20 of the same asset. Designing such a pool raises several challenging questions and we present our solutions.},

abstract = {The novel blockchain generation of Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) protocols focuses on scalability and performance to meet the requirements of distributed ledger technology (DLT), e.g., decentralization and geographic dispersion. Validating scalability and performance of BFT protocol implementations requires careful evaluation. While experiments with real protocol deployments usually offer the best realism, they are costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore simulation of unmodified BFT protocol implementations as a method for cheap and rapid protocol evaluation: We can accurately forecast the performance of a BFT protocol while experimentally scaling its environment, i.e., by varying the number of nodes or geographic dispersion. Our approach is resource-friendly and preserves application-realism, since existing BFT frameworks can be simply plugged into the simulation engine without requiring code modifications or re-implementation.},

abstract = {DeFi protocols are programs that manage high-value digital assets on blockchain. The price manipulation vulnerability is one of the common vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols, which allows attackers to gain excessive profits by manipulating token prices. In this paper, we propose DeFiTainter, an inter-contract taint analysis framework for detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities. DeFiTainter features two innovative mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness. The first mechanism is to construct a call graph for inter-contract taint analysis by restoring call information, not only from code constants but also from contract storage and function parameters. The second mechanism is a high-level semantic induction tailored for detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities, which accurately identifies taint sources and sinks and tracks taint data across contracts. Extensive evaluation of real-world incidents and high-value DeFi protocols shows that DeFiTainter outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance with a precision of 96\% and a recall of 91.3\% in detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities. Furthermore, DeFiTainter uncovers three previously undisclosed price manipulation vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {The ability to decentralize knowledge graphs (KG) is important to exploit the full potential of the Semantic Web and realize the Web 3.0 vision. However, decentralization also renders KGs more prone to attacks with adverse effects on data integrity and query verifiability. While existing studies focus on ensuring data integrity, how to ensure query verifiability - thus guarding against incorrect, incomplete, or outdated query results - remains unsolved. We propose VeriDKG, the first SPARQL query engine for decentralized knowledge graphs (DKG) that offers both data integrity and query verifiability guarantees. The core of VeriDKG is the RGB-Trie, a new blockchain-maintained authenticated data structure (ADS) facilitating correctness proofs for SPARQL query results. VeriDKG enables verifiability of subqueries by gathering global index information on subgraphs using the RGB-Trie, which is implemented as a new variant of the Merkle prefix tree with an RGB color model. To enable verifiability of the final query result, the RGB-Trie is integrated with a cryptographic accumulator to support verifiable aggregation operations. A rigorous analysis of query verifiability in VeriDKG is presented, along with evidence from an extensive experimental study demonstrating its state-of-the-art query performance on the largeRDFbench benchmark.},

abstract = {(Un)real Estates is a project and platform that explores a counterfactual narrative of the physical city and its digital counterpart. It is a provocation about the commercialisation of the infrastructure of the spatial internet. (Un)real Estates presents a proto-architectural sequence and experience between particles and pixels, matter, and event.In virtual jumpspace, machines and search terms hallucinate spatial configurations, while random probability distributions and large language models generate new topologies. This creates a stochastic architecture that is the inadvertent realisation of an architectural fantasy - architecture without architecture.The project integrates digital media techniques and architectural design syntax to explore an immersive architectural experience where the physical and virtual are fused as seamless interfaces. The project provides new ways of engaging with the built environment, and operates at limits of material practice, extending the spaces open to the architectural imagination.(Un)real Estates forestalls the terminal end of the metropolitan experiment and is an epistle to the post-urban technotopia, with all its manifold tensions and misgivings. It is a postscript for the city on the cusp of a technological singularity. By presenting a near-future scenario, (Un)real Estates serves as a cautionary tale to consider the potential consequences of the unabridged networked speculative enterprise.The project responds to the theme of (dis)engagement, and utilises AI, Machine Learning, explores subjects of data extractivism, data governance, physical and digital artefacts, and decentralised blockchain and digital ledger technologies.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that define rules for transactions running on blockchains. Since any qualified transaction sequence within the same block can be orchestrated by the blockchain miner, unexpected results may occur due to data races between transactions (called transaction races). Surprisingly, transaction races in smart contracts have not been fully investigated. To address this, we propose TransRacer, an automated approach and open-source tool that employs symbolic execution to detect transaction races in smart contracts. TransRacer analyzes function dependencies to identify transaction races hidden in specific contract states. It also generates witness transactions that can trigger such races. The experimental results on 50 real-world smart contracts show the effectiveness and efficiency of TransRacer: it detects 426 races in 255.9 minutes, including 149 race bugs leading to inconsistent states.},

abstract = {Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers.In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.},

The iBatch mechanism supports a variety of policies, ranging from conservative to aggressive batching, and can be configured adaptively to the current workloads. iBatch automatically rewrites smart contracts to integrate with legacy applications and support large-scale deployment.  For cost evaluation, we develop a platform with fast and cost-accurate transaction replaying, build real transaction benchmarks on popular Ethereum applications, and build a functional prototype of iBatch on Ethereum. The evaluation results show that iBatch saves 14.6\%-59.1\% Gas cost per invocation with a moderate 2-minute delay and 19.06\%-31.52\% Ether cost per invocation with a delay of 0.26-1.66 blocks.},

abstract = {The prosperity of Ethereum attracts many users to send transactions and trade crypto assets. However, this has also given rise to a new form of transaction-based phishing scam, named TxPhish. Specifically, tempted by high profits, users are tricked into visiting fake websites and signing transactions that enable scammers to steal their crypto assets. The past year has witnessed 11 large-scale TxPhish incidents causing a total loss of more than 70 million.In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of TxPhish on Ethereum, encompassing the process of a TxPhishTxPhish campaign and details of phishing transactions. To detect TxPhish websites and extract phishing accounts automatically, we present TxPhish, which dynamically visits the suspicious websites, triggers transactions, and simulates results. Between November 25, 2022, and July 31, 2023, we successfully detected and reported 26,333 TxPhish websites and 3,486 phishing accounts. Among all of documented TxPhish websites, 78.9\% of them were first reported by us, making TxPhish the largest TxPhish website detection system. Moreover, we provided criminal evidence of four phishing accounts and their fund flow totaling 1.5 million to aid in the recovery of funds for the victims. In addition, we identified bugs in six Ethereum projects and received appreciation.},

The study methods included a survey examining participants’ expertise regarding NFTs and cybersecurity, a remote security usability study investigating the pain points and common security best practices and a follow-up interview to examine participants’ experience with a crypto wallet configuration. The results show how human cognitive bias affects users’ decision to be cautious, users’ difficulty with security methods, and improvements to lessen users’ cognitive load. As NFTs expand beyond the cryptocurrency circle, multiple scams and thefts arise due to late adopters not knowing the security best practices. Therefore, increasing the public’s NFT security awareness is key to mitigating potential threats.},

One popular solution to address such behavior is Flashbots, a private pool with infrastructure and design goals aimed at eliminating the negative externalities associated with MEV. While Flashbots has established laudable goals to address MEV behavior, no evidence has been provided to show that these goals are achieved in practice.In this paper, we measure the popularity of Flashbots and evaluate if it is meeting its chartered goals. We find that (1) Flashbots miners account for over 99.9\% of the hashing power in the Ethereum network, (2) powerful miners are making more than 2X what they were making prior to using Flashbots, while non-miners' slice of the pie has shrunk commensurately, (3) mining is just as centralized as it was prior to Flashbots with more than 90\% of Flashbots blocks coming from just two miners, and (4) while more than 80\% of MEV extraction in Ethereum is happening through Flashbots, 13.2\% is coming from other private pools.},

Non-fungible tokens are a recent example, as they allow a decentralized way to generate and verify proof of ownership via distributed ledger technology. Despite crucial uncertainties, these tokens have generated great enthusiasm for the future of digital property and its surrounding economy. In this regard, I think there is an untapped opportunity in applying a hypertext approach to augment such highly structured ownership-based associations. To this end, in this work I propose hyperownership, based on the premises that property is the law of lists and ledgers, and that hypertext is an apt method to inquiry such a ledger system. In spite of the significant risks and challenges to realize such a vision, I believe that it has great potential to transform the way with which we interact with digital property.},

abstract = {Reentrancy, a notorious vulnerability in smart contracts, has led to millions of dollars in financial loss. However, current smart contract vulnerability detection tools suffer from a high false positive rate in identifying contracts with reentrancy vulnerabilities. Moreover, only a small portion of the detected reentrant contracts can actually be exploited by hackers, making these tools less effective in securing the Ethereum ecosystem in practice.In this paper, we propose BlockWatchdog, a tool that focuses on detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying attacker contracts. These attacker contracts are deployed by hackers to exploit vulnerable contracts automatically. By focusing on attacker contracts, BlockWatchdog effectively detects truly exploitable reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying reentrant call flow. Additionally, BlockWatchdog is capable of detecting new types of reentrancy vulnerabilities caused by poor designs when using ERC tokens or user-defined interfaces, which cannot be detected by current rule-based tools. We implement BlockWatchdog using cross-contract static dataflow techniques based on attack logic obtained from an empirical study that analyzes attacker contracts from 281 attack incidents. BlockWatchdog is evaluated on 421,889 Ethereum contract bytecodes and identifies 113 attacker contracts that target 159 victim contracts, leading to the theft of Ether and tokens valued at approximately 908.6 million USD. Notably, only 18 of the identified 159 victim contracts can be reported by current reentrancy detection tools.},

One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

abstract = {Key management has long remained a difficult unsolved problem in the field of usable security. While password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) are widely used to solve this problem in centralized applications, their low entropy and lack of a recovery mechanism make them unsuitable for use in decentralized contexts. The multi-factor key derivation function (MFKDF) is a recently proposed cryptographic primitive that aims to address these deficiencies by incorporating commonly used authentication factors into the key derivation process. In this paper, we implement an MFKDF-based Ethereum wallet and perform a user study with 27 participants to directly compare its usability against traditional cryptocurrency wallet architectures. Our results show that MFKDF-based applications outperform conventional key management approaches on both subjective and objective metrics, with a 37\% higher average SUS score (p &lt; 0.0001) and 71\% faster task completion times (p &lt; 0.0001) for the MFKDF-based wallet.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged individuals and all international collaborations, including research and academic international conferences. Most conferences had to adapt to an online or hybrid mode at best, if not cancelled or postponed. During this period, we were invited to organise the third edition of an international conference on Arts, Technology and Society. At its core, it is an academic conference, but it also offers a platform for an art exhibition and forum for artists to share and exhibit. Due to Macao's physical constraints and its inaccessibility for outside visitors, the Local Organising Committee took the challenge to organise the first virtual art exhibition in an academic conference, including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) for artists willing to sell their digital artwork. This paper presents the creative process as well as the technical issues faced during the conference and exhibition preparation time. As NFT-based virtual exhibition is a new offer within an academic international conference and a new tool to permanently promote artists’ work, we are also proposing some possible future works to develop further this approach and give it a larger visibility. We believe such type of exhibition can play an important role on a world seeking for more sustainable communication.},

In this work, we address the gap between the theory and practice of cryptocurrencies by advancing realistic approaches to analyze the economics and security of key cryptocurrency components: consensus mechanisms, transaction fee mechanisms (TFMs), and the application layer. We present novel models of these components that we evaluate both theoretically and using cryptocurrency clients. We augment our evaluation with the first evidence of an in-the-wild attack on a major cryptocurrency, highlighting our approach's practicality.

NFTs are scarce, unique, and authentic; three properties known to be key for determining perceived value. Whilst previous research has primarily focused on NFTs as a source of economic value, here we assess the psychological motivations of collectors of digital fashion NFTs. Specifically, NTFs related to digital fashion are particularly relevant to HCI researchers as they sit at the intersection between business, culture, and self-expression. Here, we survey 19 users of a digital avatar fashion company, Genies, to understand the gratifications users derive from collecting digital NFT fashion. Results demonstrate that the primary motivations for collecting fashion NFTs are self-expression and utility and that motivations associated with value are secondary. We make design recommendations based on these results, indicating that developers should distinguish between expression-based motivations and value-based motivations.},

abstract = {Within a globalized world, Portuguese culture lives between the poles of international influence and the strong inertia of their own cultural structure and dynamics, traditionally peripherical to the rest of the Western world. Portuguese cultural institutions and museums have shown an extremely cautious position in recent decades. They have remained reluctant to adapt to changes and foster new creative proposals out of the reach of the “fine arts” idea. This has led to an underestimation of new artistic currents, especially those related to new technologies. New media art is probably the art more attached to the present time. It is constantly evolving, everchanging, and very close to the quick evolution of culture and society. Despite the growing digital literacy rates reached in recent years, the digital culture has not been embraced by museums in Portugal. New media art has not been collected by official institutions, and it is almost not being exhibited and preserved for the future. The lack of institutional support provokes a deepening of the precariousness experienced by artists and the artworks. Consumed whether in the form of images appearing on platforms or social networks, whether as ephemeral works in festivals and performances, new media art is as obsolescent as weak, liquid following Bauman's term. New media art is a potential heritage at risk. This study tries to analyze this paradoxical situation, searching for the cause of the absence of new media art and, in general, the creativity related to new technologies in the official Portuguese culture. On the other hand, this research explores the dynamics of a digital culture forged in a parallel alternative structure sustained by festivals, prizes, associations, research labs and some other projects. These sources allow us to create a whole map of the country's surprisingly rich, new media art realm.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new decentralized access control framework with transitive delegation capabilities that tackles the performance and scalability limitations of the existing state-of-the-art solutions. In order to accomplish this, the proposed solution is anchored in the self-sovereign identity (SSI) paradigm, which embodies a distributed identity management system. By adopting this paradigm, we obviate slow cryptographic premises such as identity-based encryption (IBE) that were used in prior work. Furthermore, we enhance the existing verifiable credentials (VCs) from this paradigm by introducing our own decentralized permission objects to support the concept of transitive delegations. This concept allows delegates to further delegate their access to resources with the same or fewer privileges to other entities within the framework. This renders our solution suitable for diverse scenarios, including applications in decentralized building access management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of transitive delegations in this paradigm. Finally, our performance experiments show a performance enhancement of three orders of magnitude compared to the prevailing state-of-the-art solutions.},

We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment. Finally, we analyze token smart contracts to identify mechanisms that can hinder sniper bots.},

This work focuses on patterns for developing mobile wallets for AECs, analyzing the cryptocurrencies Monero and primarily Zcash, taking the latter as study case.

abstract = {The ability to allow developers to share their source code and collaborate on software projects has made GitHub a widely used open source platform. Each repository in GitHub is generally equipped with a README.MD file to exhibit an overview of the main functionalities. Nevertheless, while offering useful information, README.MD is usually lengthy, requiring time and effort to read and comprehend. Thus, besides README.MD, GitHub also allows its users to add a short description called “About,” giving a brief but informative summary about the repository. This enables visitors to quickly grasp the main content and decide whether to continue reading. Unfortunately, due to various reasons–not excluding laziness–oftentimes this field is left blank by developers. This paper proposes GitSum as a novel approach to the summarization of README.MD. GitSum is built on top of BART and T5, two cutting-edge deep learning techniques, learning from existing data to perform recommendations for repositories with a missing description. We test its performance using two datasets collected from GitHub. The evaluation shows that GitSum can generate relevant predictions, outperforming a well-established baseline.},

abstract = {As the development of Solidity smart contracts has increased in popularity, the reliance on external sources such as third-party packages increases to reduce development costs. However, despite the use of external sources bringing flexibility and efficiency to the development, they could also complicate the process of assuring the security of downstream applications due to the lack of package managers for standardized ways and sources. While previous studies have only focused on code clones without considering how the external components are introduced, the compositions of a smart contract and their characteristics still remain puzzling. To fill these gaps, we conducted an empirical study with over 350,000 Solidity smart contracts to uncover their compositions, conduct code reuse analysis, and identify prevalent development patterns. Our findings indicate that a typical smart contract comprises approximately 10 subcontracts, with over 80\% of these originating from external sources, reflecting the significant reliance on third-party packages. For self-developed subcontracts, around 50\% of the subcontracts have less than 10\% unique functions, suggesting that code reuse at the level of functions is also common. For external subcontracts, though around 35\% of the subcontracts are interfaces to provide templates for standards or protocols, an inconsistency in the use of subcontract types is also identified. Lastly, we extracted 61 frequently reused development patterns, offering valuable insights for secure and efficient smart contract development.},

When opportunities for exploiting code vulnerabilities diminish, the attackers start resorting to social engineering attacks, which aim to influence humans - often the weakest link in the system. The only known class of social engineering attacks in Ethereum are honeypots, which plant hidden traps for attackers attempting to exploit existing vulnerabilities, thereby targeting only a small population of potential victims.In this work, we explore the possibility and existence of new social engineering attacks beyond smart contract honeypots. We present two novel classes of Ethereum social engineering attacks - Address Manipulation and Homograph - and develop six zero-day social engineering attacks. To show how the attacks can be used in popular programming patterns, we conduct a case study of five popular smart contracts with combined market capitalization exceeding $29 billion, and integrate our attack patterns in their source codes without altering their existing functionality. Moreover, we show that these attacks remain dormant during the test phase but activate their malicious logic only at the final production deployment. We further analyze 85,656 open-source smart contracts, and discover that 1,027 of them can be used for the proposed social engineering attacks. We conduct a professional opinion survey with experts from seven smart contract auditing firms, corroborating that the exposed social engineering attacks bring a major threat to the smart contract systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive collection of reusable artifacts for addressing security and privacy issues in the context of flow-based programming in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) environments. With the rapid adoption of FaaS platforms, it becomes important to guarantee the security and privacy of applications. The presented artifacts incorporate a wide variety of nodes and techniques into the popular Node-RED architecture. They intend to improve the security and privacy of applications by addressing critical aspects such as secure data flow management, code authenticity and validation, access control mechanisms, and runtime monitoring and anomaly detection. Using these artifacts, developers can construct more robust and resilient applications in FaaS environments while mitigating potential security and privacy risks.},

abstract = {Reporting on the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) ecosystem overwhelmingly focuses on the community that drove its growth and price volatility, gaining widespread media attention in 2021. This overlooks the communities developing novel creative practices on NFT platforms. Interviews with 16 creatives utilizing NFTs reveal a vast Art World: networks of distinct communities maturing into cooperative ecosystems with unique artistic subcultures, philosophies, and interactions. We observe unique qualities of these decentralized distribution platforms and identify patterns of activity comparable to those of traditional art worlds. We identify how aspects of these systems might subvert, or replicate, existing systems of power, value, and access. The impacts of policy and platform design on online creative communities in the NFT Art World carry valuable lessons for developers of digital interventions into the creative industry, exemplifying pertinent considerations for the future of creative labor and cooperation online.},

abstract = {Through digital transformation, lots of personal data are captured, but individuals often do not have ownership or control over them. This results in the emerging Web 3.0, where people demand data sovereignty. There are actually two conceptually related terms, data sovereignty and digital sovereignty. This paper first explains these two concepts in terms of their points of focus, guiding principles, laws and regulations requirements, and then analyses the requirements and technical challenges of their implementation. To understand the emerging trend shift in digital sovereignty towards individuals taking control of security and privacy preserving over their own digital assets, this paper conducts a systematic review and analysis on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which is a user-centric decentralized model and autonomy for an individual to self-determine the access and use of one's identity and credentials. The review covers existing SSI solutions and points out that an efficient key management system, the scalability and interoperability of the solution, and a well-established standard are some of the challenges for SSI deployment. Finally, the paper concludes with open issues about digital identity, including dynamic attributes, persona, and attribute ownership, that challenge the current reference architecture of SSI as well as its implementation.},

abstract = {For the viability of future “mission-critical” applications such as remote surgery and connected cars, the customers must trust the network connection and operators must adhere to the Service Level Agreement (SLA). The key to enabling trust between the customer and the operator is the transparency and accountability of the SLA. That is, the operators ensure the transparent and appropriate execution of SLA clauses (e.g., Quality of Service (QoS) and compensations if the SLA is violated). In this work, we argue that today’s network is highly volatile. Therefore, it is convenient for the operators to provide service guarantees for short-term rather than traditional long-term methods. Consequently, we advocate short-term and dynamic service contracts considering spatial and temporal characteristics rather than typical long-term contracts. We propose a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-focused end-to-end transparent, accountable and automated resource provisioning system architecture in which are installed as smart contracts. In our architecture, resources can be requested and allocated dynamically and automatically with Quality-of-Service (QoS) monitoring. Our architecture is scalable through a side-channel based QoS monitoring protocol that guarantees data integrity and minimises the Permissioned Distributed Ledgers (PDL) updates. To measure the viability of our proposal, we first evaluate resource provisioning in the context of network slicing. Then we assess the DLT performance for smart contract execution, in both permissioned and permission-less settings. In the end, we evaluate the monitoring tools and compare and contrast sketches and bloomfilters, and justify our choice of bloomfilters.},
