  abstract={The advent of Web3 technologies and blockchain has opened new avenues for exploring decentralized solutions to pressing environmental issues. A blockchain-based Web3 application for the management of CO2 absorption rights could be a very effective solution to combat climate change. Blockchain technology allows the creation of permanent and transparent records of transactions in a decentralized network, which makes it an ideal tool for monitoring and managing CO2 absorption rights. The rights could be registered in the blockchain and transferred through smart contracts, which would guarantee the validity and traceability of these transactions. In addition, the Web3 application would allow greater accessibility for users, since it could be accessed from anywhere without the need to have proprietary systems installed. Decentralized applications could also be used to verify CO2 emissions and removals by users, which would increase transparency and trust in the system. This paper presents the development of a novel Web3 application that leverages blockchain technology for managing CO2 absorption rights using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The proposed application allows for the secure, transparent, and efficient management of CO2 absorption rights, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of carbon offsetting initiatives.},

  abstract={Initiatives such as blockchains and decentralized storage networks are pushing for a decentralized Web3 to replace the current architecture. At the core of Web3 are network resource sharing services, which allow anyone to sell spare network capacity in return for rewards. These services require a way to establish trust, as parties are potentially malicious. This can be achieved by reputation systems. In this paper we make the case for using deep reinforcement learning in Web3 reputation calculation. More specifically, we propose a model which allows for decentralized calculation of scores with high personalization for the user.},

  abstract={Function-as-a-service (FaaS) is an emerging computation architecture, which provides high scalability and flexibility. All the existing F aaS systems are owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. While this is not an issue for most existing enterprise applications, such character is not compatible with the decentralization principle of dApp/Web3 applications, more of which are being deployed in the cloud environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a decentralized FaaS, which is managed by multiple cloud service providers and allows a decentralized application to take advantages of FaaS. In this research paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system for managing decentralized FaaS using blockchain technology and decentralized API management, where functions are executed on a distributed network of nodes by multi-cloud data centers, rather than on a centralized server. This allows for greater scalability and flexibility, as well as improved security and reliability.},

  abstract={This paper presents a proof-of-concept (PoC) that leverages Web3 technology, specifically blockchain and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), to create a secure, transparent, and fair reseller market without the need for a trusted third party. The PoC demonstrates that NFTs can be used to authenticate items, build trust between parties and establish verifiable product own-ership. By paralleling NFT transfers with the sale of items, the practicality of selling counterfeit goods is reduced. Furthermore, the blockchain-based storage of product information enables verification of origin, history, and authenticity by any involved party, fostering transparency and equal access to information for buyers and sellers. We demonstrate that Web3 technology can effectively address critical issues in traditional reseller markets, offering substantial benefits to all parties involved.},

  abstract={Technology has advanced and with it, cybercrime has become a reality. The rise of Web3 technology aims to decentralize the internet and create a trustless network of smart contracts, leading to the limitation of conventional identification systems. Blockchain technology provides a solution to security concerns by instilling trust in end-users' minds. In this project, a blockchain-based identification system will be created using SoulBound Tokens. These NFT-like tokens cannot be transferred after minting, making them immutable and secure. Third parties can request users' credentials, which can be easily verified through the blockchain's transparent chain of custody. This approach creates a secure and reliable identification system that protects users' data and assets from malicious actors. This concept extends to finance, healthcare, and government services. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can create a more secure environment for individuals and institutions.},

  abstract={Blockchain is a decentralized, immutable, peer-to-peer network which provides trust, transparency, and tamper resistance and these features have led to various applications such as bitcoin and ethereum. Various structures of Blockchains are designed in fields such as e-health as it can facilitate safe and secure storage of the patient’s information in the health care system. Data integration problem in healthcare can be overcome by bringing a decentralized system in the hospital organization. This paper focuses on the use of Blockchains in managing medical records for insurance claim. By removing the central administrator, the suggested architecture uses Ethereum smart contracts to create a tamperproof and transparent healthcare system and ensure the integrity of sensitive patient data. Additionally, the smart contract keeps the patient well-informed and governs the communication between all the participants in the network. The proposed approach provides a solution to eliminate fraudulent insurance claims using Machine Learning (ML) with Blockchain.

Mutual monitoring of medical information on the blockchain creates a mutually supportive relationship where users themselves monitor each other. In this demonstration experiment, the system was introduced to six elderly people. This decentralized system in which users themselves monitor each other is called the Web3 type. The Web type is a technology that is expected to break through the current concentration of data in overseas digital industries and leave digital data resources in Japan. This research is unique in that it combines blockchain technology, which is at the core of this technology, with medical information.

  abstract={An all-encompassing and flexible framework that links theoretical principles and actual execution is required for the creation of hardware for Web3.0 and edge intelligence. Decentralized identification, semantic data, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs are just few of the concepts that are examined in depth to provide the groundwork for this technique. The main goal is to figure out what kinds of hardware are needed to implement these theoretical principles. Subsequently, the technique continues to extract the hardware requirements, distinguishing the unique demands, problems, and performance criteria important for enabling Web3.0 and edge intelligence. These needs include a wide range of topics, including performance, safety, efficiency, scalability, and even compatibility. Once the theoretical principles and hardware requirements are fully understood, the technique moves on to the design step. Key to realizing these abstract ideas is the development of specialized hardware architectures and components. Based on the outcomes of the performance assessment, iterative refinement is carried out to fix the hardware's flaws and enhance its functionality. As a result of this iterative process, hardware is kept up to date to suit the ever-shifting requirements of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. The suggested technique concludes with an emphasis on flexibility and future-proofing in light of the everchanging nature of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. Keeping up with technology developments and reevaluating the hardware design as needed are both part of this process.},

  abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have become a prevalent part of everyday life, making the need for IoT firmware security greater than ever. Firmware dispatch systems play a crucial role in maintaining the secure operations of IoT devices, where a compromise on the integrity of dispatches may simply ruin an IoT device. Hence it is essential to have robust solutions to safeguard such systems. With the advent of blockchain and Web3 technologies, there are new options for tackling security-related challenges. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof, secure, and fully distributed protocol, making it an excellent choice for a firmware dispatch system. In this work, we explore the existing blockchain-based solutions for distributing IoT firmware updates, and then propose a secure firmware dispatch system for IoT devices using Ethereum. Our system employs Web3.Storage, with a hosted implementation of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol. In the evaluation, we demonstrate that our designed architecture is fast, reliable, and scalable by offering a firmware integrity validation. It can benefit a wide range of manufacturers who intend to increase the security of their IoT devices.},

  pages={151-154},
  abstract={Blockchain is a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that is an emerging technology currently disrupting various fields. The aim of this paper is to explore ways to harness the advantages of blockchain while being implemented to existing systems. A permissioned blockchain can be established through Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) that utilizes ledgers that are interacted upon by a chaincode. An HLF network was established to investigate the custom chaincode. The scenario of the project was grounded on the functions performed in a web-based property inventory management system that uses a centralized database. The chaincode in the project was written using JavaScript and Node.js was used to create the whole chaincode source. A channel was built between the nodes of the blockchain where the chaincode was deployed. Subsequently, to open a gateway to the network, multiple Representational State Transfer (RST) Application Programming Interface (API) were created. Several gateway endpoints were tested through Insomnia, a cross-platform API client for RST. The tests performed employed various request methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) which resulted in evidence that the custom chaincode is fully functional and adheres to the OpenAPI specification. The paper concludes that it is highly feasible and advantageous to integrate a blockchain into an existing Web 2.0 system. Most functions and business logic in existing traditional systems can be reflected in a chaincode with proper planning and execution. In the future, other aspects of the blockchain network will be explored further.},

  abstract={The advancements of the metaverse has validated a new world of possibilities with Web2 and Web3 technologies that are increasingly immersive, interconnected, spatial and decentralized. One of the key Web3 technologies that is intersecting with the metaverse is blockchain technology, that has now imbued metaverse worlds and platform as what are now identified as Layer-1 and Layer-2 metaverse, and in tandem the intersecting of decentralized Web3 technologies including but not limited to metaverse currencies and cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens and tokenization, marketplaces, digital wallets, and blockchain main and side-chain networks. In combination with interoperable and interconnected avatars, the metaverse is evolving beyond phygital experiences and asset architecting into financial experiences and asset trading. This research paper investigates the intersections between the metaverse and Web3 emerging technologies by firstly conducting a systematic literature review of the metaverse and its intersection with emerging technologies which currently has a dearth in academic and research literature despite the developments of the Web3 metaverse and its Layer-1 Layer-2 protocol. The review is followed by pilot-testing the metaverse platforms intersecting with Web3 technologies in real-world, particularly on the use of buy-and-sell, trading and item ownership under decentralized finance and financial technology. Finally, the research assesses the resulting metaverse based on user reviews and experiences on the feasibility of Web3 metaverse. The intersection of Web3 and the metaverse is still an early adoption of IR4.0 emerging technologies, yet the convergence of the metaverse, blockchain technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence is ultimately the precursor to the future Web4.},

  pages={3342-3356},
  abstract={The use of IoT technology in collecting personal health records (PHR) within the eHealth environment is a growing trend. However, data integrity is a concern as cloud service providers (CSPs) often cannot guarantee it. Blockchain technology offers a solution to guarantee data integrity and traceability. However, the immutability of traditional blockchain conflicts with GDPR's requirements. To address scalability and privacy concerns, we have designed a comprehensive scheme that integrates the redactable blockchain with the existing revocable IPFS mechanism. Our scheme overcomes the disadvantage of residual downloading information in the traditional blockchain. Additionally, we have developed an enhanced proxy re-encryption scheme that simplifies access control for physicians without the need for complex group key management. Unlike traditional blockchains and P2P file sharing systems, our PHR platform allows for selective removal of records and files while maintaining auditable logs. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively enhances the exclusive revocation feature with acceptable overheads. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide the merit of fully complete record and file revocation on a blockchain-based system.},

  abstract={In the evolution of technology, the Web 3.0 has become the future of the technological world. The web 3.0, which is still evolving, aims in creating an immersive environment which contains smart applications supported by AI and aims in decentralization of data. In the upcoming era, the successor of today’s transactions is most likely to be the transactions through cryptocurrency, which is built on top of the blockchain technology. It is important to make the upcoming technology more reliable, secure, and fast to bring it to real-time use. To overcome the low throughput and high latency of broadcasting in blockchain technology this paper comes up with the pandemic protocol for broadcasting. Communication can be the most important part of any network to work efficiently. It is a communication protocol used for broadcasting which works on the principle of how the pandemic Covid-19 spread. The implementation of this protocol in the blockchain technology to broadcast the transactions can make the technology more efficient and faster. This implementation will be tested for its efficiency and its throughput, analyze its performance, and resolve issues. Overall, this work will help in remove the inadequacies of existing communication protocols thus helping in demonstrating the benefits of this pandemic protocol for communication. The Pandemic Protocol minimizes data redundancy, reducing latency and network congestion, a significant improvement over traditional protocol. In the Web 3.0 era, the Pandemic Protocol’s efficient communication capabilities make it ideal for real-time applications and network scalability. By minimizing redundant data, it bolsters security, reducing the risk of data tampering and strengthening data integrity. Unlike energy-intensive protocols like Proof of Work (PoW), the Pandemic Protocol minimizes resource consumption, making it eco-friendly and cost-effective.},

  abstract={${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, often cited to drastically shape our lives, is ubiquitous. However, few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0. Our definition is not the only way of understanding ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, in this article, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: ${\mathsf (i)}$(i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and ${\mathsf (ii)}$(ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService in approximately 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability and scalability.},

  abstract={Websites and Web apps have become increasingly crucial over the past decade to daily life. Over the last ten years, websites have increased from three million to over 1.7 billion. Modern centralised digital marketplaces and enterprises provide consumers with an alternative method of selling and purchasing items conveniently. However, disadvantages among the marketplaces include the platform’s potential to arbitrarily block merchants, the fees associated with listing and selling products on the site, and the lack of user data privacy. In this, we propose and demonstrate a decentralised application that takes advantage of the Ethereum blockchain to address all these issues. The Truffle development framework was employed in the creation of the application. An Ethereum smart contract later migrated to the Ethereum network comprised the application’s features. The web3.js API (Application Program Interface) was used to send the user’s input to the Ethereum network after being received through a web interface. The users involved will be able to do transactions with the help of an interactive user interface. The interfacing is done using the Truffle framework, and the transactions are made through MetaMask, where ETH tokens are used. The dApp is created using JavaScript and React JS library. Thus, the integration of the blockchain and with front-end application by interfacing it with web 3.0 helps create a secured, immutable, trusted, and easy-to-use e-commerce website.},

  abstract={Individual medical records have a high priority of integrity and security, yet they are vulnerable to data breaches and manipulation. It’s vital to communicate these data in a secure and safe manner. To overcome this problem, the proposed solution named, CoreMedi, uses blockchain technology to store and share medical data. Data stored on blockchain is immutable, verifiable and transparent (based on accessibility). As data cannot be altered on blockchain, the rate of fraud may be drastically decreased. With the help of smart contracts which are small pieces of code that run on blockchain, a Decentralized Application (DApps) is designed and implemented that enables patients/individuals to store and share medical records securely. Users may share their medical history, medications, and personal data with a specific medical personnel on the same blockchain network using CoreMedi, a Decentralized Web application. The application is implemented with React as frontend and the backend infrastructure uses Ethereum solidity smart contracts. The process of running a blockchain application is not simple because the users must be willing to spend crytpocurrencies as gas fees, as this is the way to maintain the network with no single organization having control.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of web technology, Web3.0 has attracted a considerable amount of attention due to its unique decentralized characteristics. The digital economy is an important driver of high-quality economic development and is currently in a rapid development stage. In the digital economy scenario, the centralized nature of the Internet and other characteristics usually bring about security issues such as infringement and privacy leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how to use Web3.0 technologies to solve the pain points encountered in the development of the digital economy by fully exploring the critical technologies of digital economy and Web3.0. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of Web3.0 that should be integrated with the digital economy to better find the entry point to solve the problems by examining the latest advances of Web3.0 in machine learning, finance, and data management. We hope this research will inspire those who are involved in both academia and industry, and finally help to build a favourable ecology for the digital economy.},

  abstract={The frequency of software supply chain attacks has reached unprecedented levels, primarily due to the increasing reliance on huge numbers of software and hardware dependencies, and the inherent vulnerabilities they harbor. Currently, vendors providing these software and hardware components share security advisories to centralized databases or post them on proprietary websites, which security engineers have to search manually to find vulnerabilities relevant for their systems. Furthermore, the security advisories often do not follow a standard machine-readable format, which results in the engineers having to manually analyze the documents. In this paper, SENTINEL, a novel solution for automating dissemination and discovery of security advisories leveraging Web3 technologies, is presented. In particular, the Ethereum blockchain is used by vendors to notify asset owners of novel vulnerabilities in their systems in a reliable and accountable manner. Evaluation tests conducted on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet confirm that our proposal is a functional and functioning solution for securely disseminating and discovering security advisories utilizing a fully decentralized infrastructure. SENTINEL’s source code is released as open source software on GitHub.},

  abstract={Web3 brings an emerging outlook for the value of decentralization, boosting the decentralized infrastructure. People can benefit from Web3, facilitated by the advances in distributed ledger technology, to read, write and own web content, services and applications more freely without revealing their real identities. Although the features and merits of Web3 have been widely discussed, the network architecture of Web3 and how to achieve complete decentralization considering law compliance in Web3 are still unclear. Here, we propose a perspective of Web3 architecture, deController, consisting of underlay and overlay network as Web3 infrastructures to underpin services and applications. The functions of underlay and overlay and their interactions are illustrated. Meanwhile, the security and privacy of Web3 are analyzed based on a novel design of three-tier identities cooperating with deController. Furthermore, the impacts of laws on privacy and cyber sovereignty to achieve Web3 are discussed.},

  abstract={Web3 has received a lot of attention since its emergence. It aims to provide users with more diverse and vivid web services as well as the complete control over their own data. To support the development of Web3, privacy-preserving decentralized data computing schemes need to be studied. In earlier works, blockchain was used for trusted data sharing. However, due to the lack of computing attribute, blockchain is not capable enough to ensure the trustworthiness of the distributed computing process. Besides, the distributed computing method requires a large amount of data transmission and the current privacy protection researches seldom consider the problem of user privacy. In this article, we design a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving distributed data computing architecture to break-through the limitations of existing researches. The proposed architecture ensures the secure and trustworthy computing with state channel and computing sandbox. We also design a sandbox location obfuscation method based on onion routing technology, making it difficult for attackers to identify the sandbox location or infer user privacy. Our solution fully considers the characteristics of Web3 and can well support the diverse Web3 applications.},

  abstract={Reputation is a fundamental concept in human social interactions and inter-relationship. Blockchain and Web3 have been rapidly growing, involving multi-millions of users, billions of transactions, and hundreds of millions of addresses onchain (i.e. on-blockchain). Decentralized identity and onchain reputation will play a critical role in defining each individual's persona, and natively supporting onchain entities to build trust in the Web3 space, while preserving user privacy and autonomy. This paper presents a novel reputation ranking method to address the problem. We leverage adaptive weighted Page Rank algorithms to assess and rank the reputation of participants within various public blockchains. We assign reputation scores to onchain entities based on their historical transaction behaviors, taking transaction volume, activeness, and network contributions into account. In addition to describing the theoretical framework of our reputation ranking, this paper provides empirical insights into its implementation on transactional datasets of Ethereum and BNB Chain. The results and findings presented herein offer a foundation for further research and development of onchain reputation systems in public blockchains and its applications in decentralized finance and Web3 ecosystems.},

AFFIRM enables nearby devices to self-organize as a fog network and collaboratively train machine learning algorithms locally to securely generate, validate, store and retrieve mobility data via consensus leveraging Information Centric Networking as the underlying architecture. The proposed collaborative learning enables nodes to learn and adapt with respect to parameters related to scalability, timeliness, security, privacy, and resource consumption. We evaluate AFFIRM using mobility data from New York city and results shows it to scalably store mobility data from up to 700 devices with lower delays and overhead.},

An exhaustive literature study is conducted, covering topics such as decentralized protocols, edge computing, and their significance to Web3.0, to provide a solid groundwork for this inquiry. This first stage of the investigation involves a comprehensive review of previous research, methods, and best practices in the field, with the goal of identifying areas where the envisioned synergy may fill a need. Empirical data culled from preexisting Web3.0 infrastructure, real-world use cases, and simulated data are all considered throughout the data collection process. Expert interviews and surveys are also used to collect qualitative information, with the goal of eliciting relevant feedback from specialists in the area. The research approach itself includes the design and execution of a series of experiments and simulations. These exploratory projects are meant to analyze how Web3.0 apps may best make use of decentralized protocols and edge intelligence. These factors comprise measurements relating to latency, throughput, data availability, scalability, and security/privacy. At the end of the study, a comparison is made between the suggested integrated solution and the status quo of centralized systems and other popular approaches to Web3.0 infrastructure.

  abstract={The development of effective recommender systems for Web3 assets, such as the Non-Fungible Token (NFT), requires concentration along with the growth of popularity and heterogeneity in many potential applications such as Web3 gaming and NFT rental markets, the requirements of predicting rNFT classification desire a practical solution. In this paper, we make use of the referable NFT (rNFT11In this work, rNFT mainly refers to the EIP-5521 protocol and corresponding formed network/topology [1], while NFT is used in the context of a single node, node sets, or products that align with the EIP-5521 protocol.) standard [2], indexed EIP-5521, to construct an rNFT classification framework leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN), an emerging branch of Deep Learning (DL), which learns on the inherent topology of graph-based data. In particular, we first transform the rNFT backward and onward reference relationship to a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and model appropriate node and edge features from rNFT metadata and associated token transactions. Next, a multi-layer GraphSage model is designed to include the collected features for the learning process. In this way, the model takes into account graph topology together with features to classify both the existing and incoming NFT nodes in a supervised way. We also give comprehensive elaboration on the architecture of the new GNN-based recommender system with discussions in regard to its characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, we expect to conduct extensive experiments, by presenting an initial plan, to show the feasibility and efficacy of our system.},

  abstract={Online merchandising plays an important role in internet users’ behavior. With the advent of Web3.0 and blockchain technologies, online markets can be adapted to these new changes. In traditional online markets, buying and selling are performed in a centralized manner, which, in addition to the problems of centralized systems, also brings the challenge of users’ trust. One of the challenges in online markets is maintaining the privacy and not revealing the exchanged file to unauthorized entities. Another challenge is to have a mechanism to detect fraud in the market. If the wrong file or key is sent by the seller, the fraud detection mechanism guaranties that the smart contract will be informed and the buyer will be refunded. On the other hand, the seller will be paid if a correct file and its corresponding key have been sent.Blockchain network is not suitable for file storing. Therefore, there are centralized or decentralized methods to store files in building a blockchain based file sharing market. In this work, we selected a distributed file system storage called IPFS (InterPlanetary File system). We integrated IPFS network with a suitable smart contract which is deployed on Ethereum blockchain. We provided a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any dispute that happens between market users.},

  abstract={Electronic First Information Report (e-FIR) is a basic document filed to the police stations by a victim or someone on his/her behalf when a cognizable offense such as murder, kidnapping, rape, theft, etc. is committed. In the e-FIR database, the offense's record can be compromised due to its centralized nature, and further the intentional registration of false e-FIR can occur. Thus, data integrity and transparency are key concerns in e-FIR database. In this paper, e-FIR data integrity and false registration appended with police stations in a centralized database are addressed via a consensus-based distributed blockchain solution, as an integral part of a smart city environment. Specifically, a smart contract based intelligent framework has been utilized to explore the potential of Ethereum blockchain in providing integrity to e-FIR data stored in a police station's database. Local database is interfaced with Ethereum blockchain using Web3 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol. Multiple simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Our results show a trade-off between different hashing algorithm security level for the offenses data and number of transactions stored in a single block on blockchain ledger.},

  abstract={The internet has evolved a lot in the last 40 years and its early applications has become unrecognizable. Web 1.0 focused on serving static pages is considered as the read-only web, whereas web 2.0 made way for dynamic pages making it as read-write web, which is predominantly experienced. The main problem face here is, as the users of E-commerce applications, is single-point-of-failure (SPOF), which means, the data stored in centralized servers is highly susceptible and vulnerable to attacks. Now, the internet's next evolution enables to develop decentralized applications and adds few other features like trustlessness, distributed, transparent, robust, etc. This also makes web 3.0 as read-write-own web. Now, this evolution wave of decentralization has hit the applications. To overcome this problem, this study has proposed a solution to completely decentralize the E-Commerce platform by using Blockchain in conjunction with smart contracts and utilizes the decentralized storage like IPFS (Inter Planetary File System). This article has developed a system that uses ReactJs as the frontend and the Ethereum blockchain as the backend to execute smart contracts using the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and to store data in a decentralized way by using IPFS and BigChainDb.},

  abstract={A digital transformation is being undergone by the music industry, with key drivers of change such as streaming services and blockchain technology emerging. The potential of web3 and blockchain technology to disrupt the traditional music industry business model and create new opportunities for artists and creators is examined in this study. A case study of a web3-based music player and marketplace that allows audio content to be shared and monetized in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is presented. The potential of NFTs to revolutionize the way music is distributed, consumed, and valued is explored through analysis of the platform’s features and user feedback. The findings suggest that artists can be empowered and given greater control over their creative works, while also providing consumers with a more immersive and personalized listening experience through web3 and blockchain technology. The growing body of research on the intersection of music and blockchain is contributed to by this study, and has implications for the future of the music industry.},

  abstract={The typical method of keeping track of medical records uses paper and centralised systems, which introduces a great deal of uncertainty and can lead to inaccurate information, identity theft, a lack of accessibility, and other problems. With the use of blockchain technology, which offers us security, availability, and integrity, this study seeks to address these problems. Using this, the records can be safeguarded and accessible from anywhere, at any time. This blockchain-based solution can protect a patient's life in an emergency since all of the records can be viewed in one location without the inconvenience of running various tests. Re-chain a secure blockchain-based digital medical health record management system was developed to solve the problems with the centralized and traditional system. It is based on the Ethereum network and uses web3.storage which is an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) system to store files in a decentralized manner.},

  abstract={The pharmaceutical industry's crucial task is to look after the medicines while they are being transported, by ensuring ideal storage conditions and keeping track of the complete medications sent to prevent risky scenarios. These three classifications are used by WHO: falsified, substandard, and unregistered/unlicensed. The need for sophisticated tools to identify fabricated pharmaceuticals will rise as criminals grow craftier. To identify phoney and substandard drugs, new technologies are continually being developed. A substantial lack of transparency in the current system makes it difficult for patients to understand the cost of acquired medications, making counterfeit drugs a prime issue. Moreover, if there are accusations of illegal or unethical behaviours, it could be difficult to look into supply chain tampering. The blockchain technology was employed. Two parties' transactions can be efficiently and permanently recorded using an open, distributed ledger like blockchain. Blockchains are transparent, decentralized, distributed, and unchangeable, which makes them an ideal solution for the problem of fake medications. This study proposes a mechanism for the safe distribution of medications throughout the whole supply chain. Each product in the chain can be moved between chain associates who have been confirmed using an event request-response approach. A product may be traced back to its source thanks to smart contracts, which are used to record all transactions between entities onto the blockchain. A DApp is made using the React Framework. On a local blockchain that Ganache provided, the smart contracts were put into action. The blockchain connection between the DApp and Web3.js is made possible by the Truffle framework. The outcomes of the studies show that our method is practical and marginally more secure than existing solutions.},

  abstract={Web3 is a revolutionary Internet paradigm that focusing decentralization, user empowerment, and intelligence. One of its key technologies is decentralized identity (DID), which has gained significant attention recently. However, existing DID solutions are not scalable enough to be compatible with the large-scale identity node applications required by Web3 across various fields. To overcome this challenge, we propose the first multi-layer Web3 DID architecture utilizing sharding blockchain, which provides management, scalability, and compatibility. This architecture leverages leader shards and the main chain to establish trust, while regular shards manage DID-related transactions. Specific system processes and query optimizations are also given. Besides, formal security analysis and comprehensive simulation evaluations have demonstrated that the architecture can achieve all proposed security and performance goals, including low latency of down to 2 seconds and high throughput of up to 90KTPS.},

Blockchain technology, specifically leveraging the Ethereum network, emerges as a promising solution. By utilizing blockchain's traceability features, we can meticulously monitor the origins of food ingredients, tracing their journey from farm to plate. This system, recorded on a decentralized database through smart contracts, ensures an unalterable record of the entire process, providing accessible information about harvesting dates and consumable shelf life. Beyond enhancing traceability and evaluating food quality, the blockchain-based system introduces incentive programs. Participants in the supply chain are motivated through blockchain-linked rewards or tokens, fostering transparency and security in hotel and restaurant food supply chains. This alignment of incentives promotes accountability and active engagement from all stakeholders, ensuring a secure and transparent food supply chain.},

  abstract={Different from “read” based Web1 and “read-write” based Web2, “read-write-own” based Web3 is proposed as a typical user-centric Internet to open the new generation of the World Wide Web. Web3 is the internet religious fundamentalism for data rights owned by users based on identity, data, network, and service, which requires the support of full-process data protection provided by a zero-trust and zero-touch environment. However, as to the traditional layered architecture like TCP/IP, data protection is an overlaid function, which is far away from the full-process data protection requirements. To this end, in order to build a zero-trust and zero-touch environment, a Web3 architecture is presented in this article as a promising paradigm. Meanwhile, the key principles for Web3 architecture designing are discussed, covering interoperability and interpretability of data, trustworthiness throughout network lifecycle, incentive for collaboration and sharing, and human-centric experience. Moreover, in order to achieve these principles, four aspects of enabling technologies are presented, including semantic, incentive, decentralized, and spatial technologies. Finally, some main challenges and open issues are also identified as a future direction for further work.},

  abstract={Web3.0 apps, with their emphasis on decentralization, real-time processing, and low latency, hold the key to MEC's bright future. This calls for an all-encompassing, future-oriented strategy in MEC architecture and design. The suggested technique is a multi-stage strategy for molding the future of MEC via cutting-edge architectures and designs for Web3.0 over 5G/6G networks. In the first stage, you'll examine the needs and goals of Web3.0 in detail. Real-time, lowlatency interactions are essential, as is familiarity with the dynamics of distributed apps and blockchain technology. In the second stage, we examine the current MEC setup, from edge server dispersion to data center density to network topology. The technique takes use of the low latency, high throughput, and huge device connection offered by 5G and impending 6G networks to guarantee preparedness for the future. The suggested technique is based on novel building layouts as its foundation. Latency, throughput, resource usage, scalability, and security compliance are only few of the metrics that may be evaluated to guarantee that the design is effective. The difficulties of actual deployment are also discussed; they include issues like where to put edge servers and how to scale resources according to demand. To ensure that the process remains in step with developing technologies and user preferences, it is recommended that improvements be made in a series of iterations.},

  abstract={The music industry has experienced significant growth, primarily driven by digital streaming services. However, major platforms have centralized control, limiting artists’ autonomy and revenue. To address this, the emergence of Music NFT marketplaces represents a revolutionary shift. These platforms leverage blockchain to tokenize music, turning it into unique, tradable assets through NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This allows artists to have direct interactions with fans, offer exclusive content, and establish new revenue streams. Music NFTs serve as certificates of ownership, providing proof of authenticity and making forgery challenging. Artists can choose platforms, mint and sell NFTs, and promote drops on preferred social media. Buyers acquire the original audio file and the chance to support artists. NFT owners can store collections in crypto wallets and decide to sell, with artists earning a share of subsequent sales. Music NFTs offer an alternative to streaming, providing fans a direct means to support artists, while artists strengthen connections with supporters and earn royalties from secondary sales.},

The introduction of blockchain technology prompted a new generation of social media based on the concept of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and other Web3 technologies, giving birth to the Metaverse. Decentraland is one such platform, where users can explore a 3D virtual world and communicate with each other. The main feature of Decentraland is that the virtual world is divided into parcels, implemented through NFTs, that can be traded among users and where owners can create buildings or mini-games for other users to play with. In this work, we explore the virtual world of Decentraland by presenting the main details of the virtual world and by focusing on the economic impact of NFT trading on the description of the parcels. In detail, the parcel's description can be used to advertise the proximity of the parcel to infrastructures or special projects to attract potential buyers. This paper's findings show the impact and the magnitude of this phenomenon, highlighting entire quarters that adopt this technique throughout the map by overriding the playful aspect of the platform.},

  abstract={Decentralization promises to remedy the drawbacks of the web by executing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchains. Unfortunately, modern blockchains cannot support realistic web application workloads mainly due to congestion.We introduce the Smart Redbelly Blockchain (SRBB), a provably correct permissionless blockchain that reduces congestion by (1) avoiding redundant propagation and validations of transactions with Transaction Validation and Propagation Reduction (TVPR) and (2) mitigating the propagation of invalid transactions within blocks by Byzantine nodes with a dedicated Reward-Penalty Mechanism (RPM). Our comparison of SRBB against Algorand, Avalanche, Diem, Ethereum, Quorum, and Solana, using the DIABLO benchmark suite, indicates that SRBB outperforms all these blockchains under real application workloads. Moreover, SRBB is the only blockchain to successfully execute real workloads of NASDAQ and Uber on a DApp without losing transactions. To demonstrate that TVPR and RPM are the causes of the improved performance, we compare SRBB with its naive baseline, which does not contain TVPR and RPM. Our results show that TVPR increases the throughput by 55× and divides the latency by 3.5, while RPM increases the throughput by 7% under flooding attacks. Finally, TVPR helps reduce transaction losses in the normal scenario while RPM goes further and mitigates transaction losses under flooding attacks.},

  abstract={The implementation of blockchain technology by various businesses has gained impetus at the same time as within the finance area it is achieving new heights progressively. To generate a distributed ledger a blockchain (data structure) is utilized. Basically, a blockchain is a collection of (a page of a ledger or record book) i.e. blocks in a sequential fashion. A record book holds all dealings, timestamps, the hash value of the preceding block, record book compensation, record book number, and others. Each single record book holds a hash value of the preceding record book or block, therefore making a series of record books accompanying one another. In this research work, while discovering these DApps, we will discover them at a stage that is sufficient to comprehend in what way they work and manage various concerns. In this research work, we will deliberate and recognize Blockchain arrangement, how Ethereum works, writing smart contracts, the introduction of web3.js, and wallet services.

  abstract={Domain Name Service (DNS) has become an essential element of the Internet in current era. The traditional DNS extends its authority down to the Top Level Domains (TLDs) and individual names before returning to the Root Server. To avoid the cons related to centralized authority scheme of the traditional DNS, recently many techniques based on the decentralized Internet with support of Blockchain (BC) are emerging. Hence, currently a variety of protocols and mechanisms are focusing on implementation of the Decentralized Naming Services which in turn supports concept of decentralized internet services. These Decentralized Naming Services are totally based on Blockchain architectures and provides various pros like resistance to single point of failure, resistance to censorship and permanent proof of ownership. Blockchain Domain Names act as Digital Identity in Decentralized Internet. Security is major concern in any DNS system and the similar challenges exists in the Blockchain DNS system too. Further, there is a lot of diversity being observed in decentralized internet space as a Domain name in a Blockchain DNS can refer to a website/portal or a wallet or a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) or simply be parked. Also, currently, there is rampant growth in development of decentralized applications with no standards implemented - neither across Blockchains nor regions. Hence, there is a need to detect security exploits carried out using malicious domains in Blockchain DNS system and implement mitigation measures accordingly. In this research work, we study and analyze malicious domain names in decentralized BC system. We explored Ethereum transaction dataset for detecting malicious transactions using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms with good accuracy of 99% and 95% using Decision Tree and 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) respectively. We also applied ML techniques on Ethereum wallet dark list dataset for detection of domain names that were vii used for phishing attacks. We received 96% accuracy after handling data imbalance by Random Forest model. Model predicted nature of domain based on 17 features that were extracted from Ethereum wallet dark list dataset like number of consonants, vowels, digits, symbols and their ratios to length of domain.},

We identify key elements comprising the P2P energy trading platform based on blockchain. The software architecture of our energy trading platform is provided with example codes. We build smart contracts on Ethereum for determination of trading price as well as matching between prosumers and consumers in such a way to balance the surpluses and the demands. At the start of each trading period, the prosumers and consumers send their respective amounts of surplus or demand. And the smart contract for price determination automatically evaluates the price in a predetermined way to balance surplus and demand within the neighborhood. Another smart contract performs matching between prosumers and consumers using this price. Authenticated and private messaging called `whisper' is employed for prosumers and DSO(Distributed System Operator)s to notify injection of surplus energy to the DSO and verify the ownership of the injected energy. Each participant interacts with Ethereum virtual machine through web server built with Node.js, Web3.js and Geth. We build a small experimental setup with 4 Raspberry-Pis in a private Ethereum network to provide proof-of-concept for our blockchain based P2P trading architecture between neighbors.},

  abstract={Voting is the essential element for each nation to express one’s choice. Nowadays, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are used to poll which may be tampered resulting in incorrect election results. Therefore, an online voting system has been introduced in this research. An Electronic Voting (E-Voting) machine is a balloting machine wherein the election opinions are notated, saved, stored, and processed digitally, which makes the balloting control project complicated than the conventional paper based method. The Election Commission forms elections and enlist party candidates along with the parties for contesting the election. This paper works with the following ideas by having the two different sets of modules: election commission and the voters. An election’s REST API is arranged on Ethereum’s Blockchain, which is the front end. The votes are then stored on the blockchain architecture, to which the Election Commission grants the number of votes. However, there are some limitations due to the fact that the blockchain architecture cannot run on the main net as it must be hosted, and a separate web3 provider must be used for interacting with it due to the lack of public API availability.},

  abstract={In recent years, permissionless blockchains have gained significant attention for their ability to secure and provide transparency in transactions. The development of blockchain technology has shifted from cryptocurrency to decentralized finance, benefiting millions of unbanked individuals, and serving as the foundation of Web3, which aims to provide the next generation of the internet with data ownership for users. The rise of NFTs has also helped artists and creative workers to protect their intellectual property and reap the benefits of their work. However, privacy risks associated with permissionless blockchains have become a major concern for individuals and institutions. The role of blockchain in the transition from Web2 to Web3 is crucial, as it is rapidly evolving. As more individuals, institutions, and organizations adopt this technology, it becomes increasingly important to closely monitor the new risks associated with permissionless blockchains and provide updated solutions to mitigate them. This paper endeavors to examine the privacy risks inherent in permissionless blockchains, including Remote Procedure Call (RPC) issues, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), miner extractable value (MEV) bots, on-chain data analysis, data breaches, transaction linking, transaction metadata, and others. The existing solutions to these privacy risks, such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, Hyperledger Fabric, and stealth addresses, shall be analyzed. Finally, suggestions for the future improvement of privacy solutions in the permissionless blockchain space shall be put forward.},

  abstract={Today, educational data, controlled centrally by educational institutions and administrative units, may be vulnerable to damage caused by natural disasters, political instability, and wars. Simultaneously, challenges arise in accessing this data for educational activities within the framework of exchange programs or lifelong learning. In the literature, there are numerous blockchain-based studies focusing on storing and sharing data in various fields. While several studies exist on blockchain applications for certification, verification, and data sharing in the education sector, a fully decentralized infrastructure has not yet been presented. To address this issue, it is proposed that data control should shift to the hands of students, who are the rightful owners of the data, rather than being solely in the hands of educational institutions. In alignment with the decentralized internet vision, Web3, public blockchain networks are considered the most suitable infrastructure for this purpose. To meet this need, a framework named PublicEduChain has been introduced within the scope of this study. PublicEduChain allows students to store their data in smart contracts created on the public Ethereum network, making it possible to share this information with any educational institution and administrative units. Educational institutions can access student data stored in smart contracts on the public Ethereum network through Learning Management System (LMS) applications and can add data to these contracts. PublicEduChain ensures that data is managed under student ownership within a fully decentralized infrastructure. The practical steps in PublicEduChain, such as creating a smart contract, logging into LMSs with Ethereum IDs, and allowing LMSs to read and write data in the student contract, are explained in detail.},

  abstract={Web3 represents an evolution of the centralized and siloed topology of Web2 by focusing on more connected, decentralized, and open technology to democratize data and services between databases, tools, devices, people, teams and organizations to provide secure single sources of truth on decentralized trust lay-ers. However, sensitive data, such as intellectual property, classified information, personal data, or medical records, cannot be distributed to those without explicit access. A standard solution is to encrypt the data before uploading and then distribute the decryption key to select persons. This solution does not sufficiently protect against data leakage. In addition, legal, contractual, and GDPR requirements are not met in current Web3 systems. This study suggests critical requirements for any Web3 system that targets sensitive data, private and permissioned needs, and enterprise and governmental applications. A preliminary framework is then introduced for building compliant Web3 systems to the suggested requirements. The study proposes changes to the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) protocol, with the main change being that each request checks against a ledger if the requestor has access to the data. Two novel Ethereum smart contracts, Enterprise Architecture and Smart Legal Contract, are presented to meet the suggested requirements.},

  abstract={Decentralized digital identity verification systems based on blockchain technology, or D.D.I.V.S as they are popularly known, are linchpins for an entirely new way of authenticating our online identities. These systems possess a number of obvious merits compared to the traditional methods of identity verification, for instance elevated security level, privacy protection and practicability. This article introduces a Prototype system using MetaMask, a very well-known cryptocurrency wallet and Web3 gateway. The system offers significantly superior results than traditional approaches. Its parts include user registration and data extraction by means of public key registration, secure key storage with MetaMask, an uninterrupted connection between D-Apps (Decentralized Applications) and the wallet; and application of asymmetric cryptography to data encryption and decryption. Strict testing has confirmed the MetaMask-powered prototype system can provide a secure, private and practical decentralized digital identification verification platform. That heralds a promising change for all of us},

  abstract={Adoption of Blockchain for the Internet of Things (IoT) has seen a steady increase of interest for overcoming some key challenges like security, privacy and decentralization. However, most blockchains are computationally expensive, have scalability bottlenecks and, if not adopted efficiently may lead to higher transactional costs which are not suitable for most IoT network deployments. State Channel protocols for blockchain networks have been one of the solutions for improving the scalability and minimizing the computation overhead in the system. In this paper, we analyse various state channel protocols and propose a systematic framework to decide upon choosing a specific protocol and apply them for IoT networks as per the needs and requirements of the enterprise.},

  pages={76-85},
  abstract={Web3 is a blockchain-powered web evolution. In many situations, Web3 smart contracts require data from outside their applications (off-chain data) via APIs to function as designed. Existing APIs in Web3 facing the most common and critical risks originate through access control vulnerabilities (i.e., Broken Object Level Authorization, Broken Function Level Authorization, and Broken Authentication). Such vulnerabilities during runtime cannot be spotted during the development and testing phases of a Web3 application that integrates APIs. Continuous monitoring is the key to proactive hunting access control attacks, which are not attainable through manual monitoring. In this paper, we design a real-time automated security monitoring approach named the access behavior learning (ABL) model for early detection and prevention of access control attacks before they could cause any damage. In two steps, the ABL approach predicts an attacker's access behavior in response to environmental behavior. First, it verifies the API providers and oracle by defining authentication schemes using OpenAPI Specification (OAS) standard to identify the API endpoints to endorse authenticity. In addition, it validates the oracle-level authentication security schemes for approving authentication. Second, it scans metadata for the current access record and compares it with the previous access records, such as location, application id, and API key, to form a baseline that determines authentication. Using this baseline, ABL determines legitimate application access based on both factors for identifying its authentication. ABL approach retains API security by designing an efficient correlation to enable complex off-chain computation by predicting API access attacks. The ABL approach is evaluated against different Web3 applications with varying levels of access control vulnerabilities where applied for early attack detection and prevention. Compared to traditional manual detection processes, the ABL approach offers early automated detection and prevention of attacks during runtime, which results in enhanced security measures and reduces the risk of potential threats.},

  volume={61},
  number={8},
  pages={52-58},
  abstract={Web3 (also known as Web 3.0) metaverse is a blockchain-driven networked, decentralized, and open virtual world. The key feature of the Web3 metaverse is that the ownership of digital assets is recorded by non-fungible token (NFT) protocol on the blockchain. Thus, users are better encouraged to construct Web3 metaverse due to the ownership of their user-generated content (UGC). However, the existing UGC editors mainly face two challenges: they cannot guarantee the uniqueness of UGC; and they are hard-pressed to find a trade-off between model granularity and 3D modeling difficulty. In this article, we design a novel UGC editor for the Web3 metaverse, named MetaCube, to address these challenges. MetaCube applies an artificial intelligence (AI) method to assist the UGC creation for decreasing the 3D modeling difficulty while maintaining the model granularity. To guarantee the uniqueness of UGC, this article proposes 3D Crypto-dropout, a specially designed dropout that can utilize user information to control the UGC creation process and generate unique fine-grained 3D models. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3D Crypto-dropout can effectively guarantee the uniqueness of UGC from both numerical and human-centered evaluation. Moreover, the existing challenges and open research topics for the uniqueness of UGC are also profoundly discussed.},

Today we are faced with challenges around regulation, data safety and privacy, as well as governance and bureaucracy - to name just a few. As Web3 gains more traction globally it activates new paradigms to engage, govern, create, iterate, and implement around research results in ways that were previously complex and arduous. The Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is one such empowering Web3 utility, and within this framework researchers and experts have the opportunity to implement and test their research results promptly on a small or large scale as required.

  volume={},

  pages={5595-5601},
  abstract={The current online social network landscape is characterized by competition to get larger audiences leading to massive user migrations which will determine the shape of the future Web. However, user migration phenomena have not been fully understood and their driving mechanisms are still not well identified; in particular, the behaviors of hubs and the influence they exert on their followers are unclear. In this work, we focus on these aspects by analyzing the propensity of hubs to migrate towards a new social platform as a consequence of a shocking event; and the influence they exert on the decision of their neighbors of migrating to a new platform or staying on the native one. We conducted analysis on data made available after a user migration consequence of a hard fork involving two Web3 online social networks based on the blockchains Steem and Hive. Due to the blockchain nature of these Web3 platforms, we got detailed data about social and financial interactions among the users, along with information that allowed a precise reconstruction of the context surrounding the migration. The main findings suggest that different types of hubs apply different strategies when choosing to migrate, e.g. financial hubs diversify their strategy by staying and migrating at the same time. As for hub influence, results suggest that users directly interacting with hubs tend to migrate. In general, findings on influence indicate that understanding the activity and the influence of hubs is crucial in monitoring and controlling the user migration process.},

  abstract={Due to its distributed, decentralized database and capacity to offer immutability, tamper resistance, and transparency qualities, blockchain technology has attracted interest for use in the healthcare sector. Blockchain technology integration has the potential to enhance healthcare data management. By incorporating blockchain, healthcare networks can establish trust and ensure data security and privacy. However, existing studies mainly focus on the relationship between patients and hospitals, neglecting the incorporation of insurance aspects such as indemnity and insurance reimbursement. This paper proposed to address this issue by proposing a comprehensive blockchain-based healthcare system that encompasses the entire process, from patient registration to payment and insurance claiming procedures. The paper's focus on privacy rules, which enables the systematic management of hospital data in compliance with regulations including the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is a major strength. The legal framework has been carefully examined to facilitate the implementation of this project. The system implemented in this study utilizes Hyperledger Besu, a private blockchain platform. Given the sensitivity of healthcare data, a privacy group and permission settings are employed to prevent unauthorized access. The technical design of the healthcare network and an early-stage prototype are described in detail.},

  abstract={At present, the concept of metaverse has sparked widespread attention from the public to major industries. With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.},

  abstract={The healthcare industry is not immune to the trend of adopting new IT systems, and this includes hospitals and doctors’ offices. To store a patient’s medical history (including diagnoses and treatments), medical history (including diagnostic pictures), and financial data (including demographics and insurance details), a computerised database known as an “Electronic Health Record” (EHR) is used. Because medical records are typically private and must be shielded from prying eyes, ensuring their secure transfer is a top priority for healthcare systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in the proposed study to ensure the security of all sent medical data, including the Chest X-ray MedPix images. This article describes a blockchain-based solution that patients can use to keep all their data in one secure location. This system was built with the Ganache tool on the Ethereum network, making use of Solidity and web3.js as well as other languages, tools, and approaches. In this study, a systematic method is described wherein blockchain smart contracts are used to record patient information and execute tasks in a distributed environment. After a smart contract has been deployed, all transactional communication occurs within its encrypted confines, protecting both the parties and their personal information. As an added bonus, the validated and broadcasted changes intended by the transaction can be checked. To ensure that government agencies have quick access to protected records, there is a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) that stores the information in an encrypted, decentralised manner. Both patients and physicians can use the wallet to log in. In addition, the system will manage and protect all of the doctor and patient’s information. Things like the following are in scope for the proposed system: Users may now access the same information at the same time because to blockchain’s distributed ledger capabilities, which boosts productivity, establishes trust, and lowers barriers to entry. Setting individual permissions for users allows for safe data storage. In addition, the suggested method enables the safe transmission of patient medical records.},

  abstract={An official transcript is a document that is produced by the registrar's office and that provides a complete representation of a student's academic record. Yet, an official transcript does not record any of the student's extracurricular activities despite the fact that such activities can shape the student's personal and professional development. It is usually the student's responsibility to keep a running log to document the attended events and the participated activities, their dates and locations, and the number of participants in such activities. These activities, not only improve the student's communications level, expand the learned skills, and develop the pursued interests, but also open the door to present an in-depth path of the student's professional and personal growth. However, students in general, have hard time documenting and providing proof of all of their extracurricular activities during their educational years. This project addresses and solves this problem and present an innovative, reliable, secure, and even portable (possibly across educational institutions) solution. Our solution encompasses a decentralized Web3 App (dApp), Ethereum smart contract and blockchain, and Metamask crypto wallet. The dApp registers the students' activities using tokens applied to smart contracts that are saved/inserted on the Ethereum blockchain. The student can then use the combination of Etherscan block explorer and the crypto wallet's public address, to provide a detailed and certified extracurricular transcript or log of the extracurricular activities participated in or attended. The extracurricular transcript could be requested by a recruiter or an employee of the human resources department as a part of the hiring process or a promotion.},

  abstract={In recent years, the rapid development and popularization of social media platforms have provided rich social experiences for people, but also posed a series of challenges, such as the spread of false information and malicious attacks. To address these issues, this paper considers a named entity recognition technology-based social media management platform. We aim to illustrate the importance of real-name authentication and identity management, and how to implement these functions using named entity recognition technology and other advanced technologies. Thus, we propose an innovative solution that consists of Web 3.0, blockchain, and the metaverse, with real-name authentication and identity management as its core functions. In addition, in order to achieve high-precision named entity recognition requirements, a standard Chinese Sina Weibo Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset is used for model training. Based on experimental verification, the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed solution are demonstrated, which also provides new ideas and methods for the application of natural language processing technology in the social media field. Moreover, the proposed solution may help promote the healthy development of social media platforms, enhance user experience, and maintain a good network ecosystem.},

  abstract={NFT Club - An attempt to generalize a concept that is pretty known to the public but needs to be understood clearly. NFT or Non-Fungible Tokens are digital assets that are traded on platforms made on the blockchain with the help of cryptocurrencies. Our effort in this project is to create an NFT trading platform that is hassle-free for the normal public to understand and operate on. People can buy and sell NFTs via standard trading means of cryptocurrencies. To provide an Ethereum environment on the front-end part of the application we will implement the Web3.js library. There are various other technologies at play to make this idea possible e.g. we are using MetaMask, from which users may send and receive Ethereum-based coins and tokens, broadcast transactions, save and manage account keys, and securely connect to decentralized applications using a suitable web browser or the built-in browser of the mobile app. Solidity will be used to create the decentralized platforms, an object-oriented, high-level language used for targeting Ethereum Virtual Machine. We hope that through this project we’ll be successful in easing the process of making people understand that NFT is an accessible commodity to interact and trade with and their assets are safe with evolving platforms such as Blockchain.},

  abstract={Smart Contract and Blockchain are necessary for transactions in supply chain management. A smart contract is an agreement in the form of a cryptographic code digitally signed by the actors. This technology holds the data transaction transparently and securely. The actors may benefit without intermediaries involved in the transaction. Supply chain management will be easily tracked by decentralized data sharing. Supply chain management involves transactions in agricultural sectors such as farmers, village cooperatives units, distributors, and consumers. The Cooperative is a party that buys goods from farmers and sells them to consumers. A smart contract is a digital signature that can access the system in transactions. The system records log activities that show the origin of transactions. All actors can see the transaction of agricultural products stored in the blockchain ledger in the Blockchain. This paper discusses blockchain-based Smart Contract scenario for supply chain management that is simulated and implemented in the Serious Game. The Game is developed using Unity 3D Development Platform, programming language contract using Solidity, Moralis as Web3 Development Platform and dApp as backend blockchain, Network Environment Polygon Ethereum, and Database that is Redis Enterprise, MongoDB Compass, and Mumbai Testnet.},

  abstract={Recently, Web3 has received extensive attention as the next generation Internet and is in rapid development, which can highly integrate the physical world with the digital world. The blockchain that can build trust and fog computing with distributed computing mode can fit well with the decentralization idea of Web3. The combination of the two can provide an effective solution for the implementation of Web3. This article proposes a new network architecture, fog-assisted blockchain radio access network (FogBC-RAN), which supports stable and mutual trust connections on a global scale, and can smoothly coordinate multi-dimensional resources to support new services such as holographic communication, digital twin, and sensory interconnection. With the interconnection of ten thousand chains in the future Web3, the cross-chain information transfer process based on Polkadot for charging sharing is presented, which can realize flexible cross-chain transactions. Meanwhile, for the mainstream computing-intensive applications of Web3, considering the latency, energy consumption and transaction cost, a computing offloading strategy based on matching game is proposed to minimize the system cost. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the offloading mechanism proposed in FogBC-RAN.},

  abstract={Nowadays, crowdfunding has become a popular source for raising funds, especially for startups or projects. Many startups opt for crowdfunding platforms to raise funds by exchanging equity because it is affordable and straightforward. However, concerns related to security, investor abuse, and illegal transactions have emerged, which have led to an investigation of the implications of blockchain technology in crowdfunding. In our proposed system, we integrate the functioning of crowdfunding platforms with the blockchain technology. The system will provide a platform for startup ventures where they can pitch their ideas to potential investors. The investors can invest in the ventures in return of equity. All the process is handled by the smart contracts making it transparent, immutable and secure. This reduces the risk of fraudulent transactions. The main advantage of the system is it uses platform sensitive token that can be exchanged with INR and further converted to ER20 token that can be used to communicate with ethereum blockchain. This eliminates the need of having ethers or any kind of wallet for the investors. We have created a mobile based application using Flutter Framework and deployed the smart contract using truffle. We have created a backend using NodeJs server which utilizes the functions from smart contract by creating the instance for them. We have also used MongoDB cloud atlas as a database along with the Ethereum Blockchain.},

  abstract={In the last few years, the technological future becoming apparent by the introduction of smart contracts into mainstream technology, specifically in the development of Web3 and the metaverse. Smart contracts will play a vital role in the decentralization and autonomy of the day-to-day tasks that must be completed. Several literature reviews, considered secondary sources, highlight the current state of testing methods for smart contracts made for Blockchain applications. In this paper, we present the results from a systematic mapping study to give structure to the information found from primary sources. Systematic mapping is a well-known method to identify and categorize research papers in a field with an increasing amount of literature. For this systematic mapping, we searched for studies between 2017 and present-day (March 2022) and were able to find 303 results, from which 47 were selected, by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, to be relevant to this study. A concept map was created from the information gathered from primary sources to the attributes such as research type, contribution type, blockchain network, smart contract language, development process, testing methods, and testing environment. We also categorized the trends and demographics found in the selected papers based on publication year, author’s country, and more. The results of this systematic mapping showed that this field is very new and quickly increasing with new research. The researchers that are interested in this field could use the results found to create opportunities for their future work.},

  abstract={A blockchain-based electronic health record (EHR) system has been proposed to manage patient data and maintain computerized records across different healthcare institutions. The main objective of this system is to provide immediate access to patient health information while addressing concerns about privacy and security. It is developed on the Ethereum network using programming languages, tools, and technologies such as Ganache, Solidity, and web3.js. The system uses smart contracts to provide security and privacy, and transactions are verified and propagated to the entire decentralized network. The system includes a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) with a centralized privacy system that allows authorized parties to access and secure records quickly. The proposed system aims to achieve several objectives such as allowing users to receive the same data simultaneously, increasing efficiency, building trust, and reducing barriers. It secures data storage by restricting user access and enables the secure transfer of patient medical records. The solution allows for better transparency and ownership of sensitive data, which can be recorded and safeguarded via blockchain technology, therefore assisting the healthcare sector. This paper describes a medical record system and a new protocol that can be used quickly and safely, paving the way for more secure and efficient healthcare systems. Overall, the proposed system offers potential solutions to the challenges associated with traditional EHR systems and has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry.},

  abstract={Modern day entertainment and music streaming has largely been dependent on digital technologies. People prefer subscription based online services to buying physical copies of the music albums. Online streaming services like Spotify, Apple iTunes, Google Music offer great services to the listener with ease. However, drawbacks to these systems includes long delays in payouts for the artists, lack of transparency, confusing payments and licensing terms. In this paper we propose an application that solves all these three drawbacks by making use of Ethereum blockchain and IPFS protocol. The Ethereum blockchain is used for recording transactions and payment management using smart contracts. As storing large files on the Ethereum network costs a lot, the IPFS protocol is used for storing music files, which is a peer to peer protocol. The frontend is built using Web3.js and both listener and artist interact on the blockchain through browser. A PPP(Pay-Per-Play) model with fixed price or as per artist will be defined in the smart contract. The artist can also add other benefactors and share the pay with them. Streaming will be a free service; however, the listeners can tip the artists for supporting. PPP is a smart contract that will be running on the Ethereum blockchain that will be used to set and reward artists with a fixed set of tokens, native currency of platform, per play. Miners will mine new blocks to be added to the blockchain, for which they will be incentivized with tokens. 25 percent of tokens mined per block will go towards a pool for paying artists for streams of their music. The IPFS nodes for storing and distribution of music will be controlled by the artists. Thus, a complete autonomous system for music streaming can be built with least involvement of third parties, and a direct relationship between artist and listener.},

The route taken from the producing facility to the final consumer is the traceability. Implementing block chain technology would be an excellent complement to attain this level of traceability and transparency for pharmaceutical items in the healthcare industry. It prevents unauthorised alterations to the information. Blockchain is a method of storing data in units called blocks that contain cryptographic hashes of earlier blocks to form a chain and a timestamp that keeps track of when a transaction was completed. Each block is protected cryptographically, making it difficult or impossible to alter, hack, or cheat by alrtering it.},

Real estate investment has been a proven hedge against inflation over many decades. The Real Estate sector despite so much contribution to the financial system has seen relatively less innovation in terms of technology. Blockchain has shown a great affinity towards managing real estate properties and all the transactions involved. Investment in this sector usually requires huge capital as a result, small retail investors are not able to invest. This is where Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) comes to the rescue of retail investors. This paper focuses on the ERC721M token standard and proposed architecture as to how a REIT company can make use of ERC721M to design their Decentralized Asset organization, or simply DAO, which will help them in adapting web3 technologies and bring automation in their procedure of operations with maximum transparency, We have also done a comparative analysis of ERC721Mv/s Standard Deployment and why ERC721M is the best token standard to be suited for creating smart contract interface for such an operation.},

  abstract={We present an implementation of a Web3 platform that leverages the Groth16 Zero-Knowledge Proof schema to verify the validity of questionnaire results within Smart Contracts. Our approach ensures that the answer key of the questionnaire remains undisclosed throughout the verification process, while ensuring that the evaluation is done fairly. To accomplish this, users respond to a series of questions, and their answers are encoded and securely transmitted to a hidden backend. The backend then performs an evaluation of the user’s answers, generating the overall result of the questionnaire. Additionally, it generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof, attesting that the answers were appropriately evaluated against a valid set of constraints. Next, the user submits their result along with the proof to a Smart Contract, which verifies their validity and issues a non-fungible token (NFT) as an attestation of the user’s test result. In this research, we implemented the Zero-Knowledge functionality using Circom 2 and deployed the Smart Contract using Solidity, thereby showcasing a practical and secure solution for questionnaire validity verification in the context of Smart Contracts.},

In particular, transparency and traceability can significantly get improved by a blockchain based data exchange platform which provides an immutable source of truth driven by a multi-stakeholder consensus. This also helps authenticate the provenance of products which is an added value that can be monetized by the supply chain participants. Nonetheless, due to the transparent nature of the blockchain, privacy and confidentiality are still a major concern for industries. In this paper, we present zk-BeSC, a blockchain enabled supply chain scheme based on zero-knowledge proofs of polynomials. The scheme allows transactions between supply chain participants in a privacy preserving fashion. It also offers tamper-resistance and replication due to the intrinsic nature of the blockchain. ZK-BeSC is fully implemented using an ethereum testnet and a web3 application. The scheme performs efficient proofs and has reduced gas consumption during verification.},

  abstract={In order to reduce limitations and as a practical substitute for voting on paper, electronic voting has developed gradually as a feasible alternative. The last decade's worth of related studies implies that, building a secure e-voting system using web 2.0 technology that assures the integrity of the votes while also giving transparency has been a long-standing difficulty. In a network of centralized systems, a single party has the right to administer data sources. Since the centralized voting systems are more vulnerable to data manipulation issues, the trust has faded in the voters on behalf of the entire process. In this paper authors discuss the solution with blockchain which is secured. The proposed implementation is ideal for small or medium-scale elections, and this includes several basic components of our methodology in three fictitious modules: the administrative module, the Voters module, and the Blockchain module. Node JS, Ganache, and Web3 JS are used as the main technologies. In conclusion, it is expected to implement a secure system for conducting web-based digital voting that ensures the integrity of the votes registered. Furthermore, it intends to enhance the system in the future to accommodate large-scale elections with a viable solution to the blockchain trilemma issues.},

  abstract={While the web3 is used to form a decentralized society and focuses particularly on financial transactions in the form of transferable tokens rather than ensuring trust among its entities. With this paper we discuss how non-transferable tokens referred as soulbound tokens (SBTs) can be used to make individuals more credible by having their affiliations encoded in the form of souls to ensure trust within the network. More specifically we discuss how the credentials of students regards to their academic achievements and their credibility can be stored and verified in an decentralized society which shall provide more privacy and security than a centralized system which shall eventually lead to have a higher credibility of data.},

  abstract={Interoperability is one of the main challenges of blockchain technologies, which are generally designed as self-contained systems. Interoperability schemes for privacy-focused blockchains are particularly hard to design: they must integrate with the unique privacy features of the underlying blockchain so as to prove statements about specific transactions in protocols designed to obfuscate them. This has led to users being forced to weaken their privacy, e.g. by using centralised exchanges, to move assets from one chain to another. We present Zclaim, a framework for trustless cross-chain asset migration based on the Zcash privacy-protecting protocol. Zclaim integrates with an implementation of the Sapling version of Zcash on a smart-contract capable issuing chain in order to attain private cross-chain transfers. We show that a tokenised representation can be created via a set of collateralised intermediaries without relying on or revealing the total amount to any third party.},

  abstract={The popularity of blockchain games continues to grow as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) become the center of attention, contributing to the move towards Web3. We leverage the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and NFTs, backed by blockchains, to build a flexible, decentralized, and fair baseline system for trading games. Our solution creates a fully decentralized system, where new business models are enabled. In particular, we introduce and support the evolvability of ingame assets, enable their resale with dynamic pricing, depending on their rarity, and automatically provide a cut to the digital artists, without the need for a trusted (third) party. Our system guarantees that the in-game assets will remain online long-term, by orchestrating various decentralized services. Thus, users do not risk losing control over the artefacts or their value, even if the gaming company loses interest, or goes bankrupt. We considered and compared the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) as the naming component of the system and selected ENS for our solution, despite the fact it introduces monetary cost. Finally, we validate our claims and evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system through a proof of concept implementation.},

  abstract={This research was conducted to apply other ways of transacting modern digital art using blockchain technology. This technology can help artists easily sell their works of art by verifying the ownership of digital art, where previously only physical art could do it. The use of NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) in publishing digital artworks in a digital marketplace media platform can be a solution for the copyright of work in the future for artists in Indonesia. The developed Marketplace platform applies the Polygon Matic blockchain technology and a smart contract from a third party, namely MetaMask, to secure and process every transaction that occurs to provide security and convenience in digital commerce.},

  abstract={Driving became a life-skill with the increase in the number of vehicles on Indian Roads. You need all vehicle-related documents while driving a vehicle on public roads. Traffic Officers will ask you to produce them for verification. Carrying these documents physically is a cumbersome task with a high possibility of documents getting lost or in a poor readable form. Remember the authenticity of these vehicle documents are also debatable. With so many flaws in the current system, there is a need for a system competent of reducing the task of carrying these vehicle documents and also guarantees the authenticity and transparency. As per the Motor Vehicles Act in India, it is mandatory that when driving a vehicle, drivers must carry vehicle-related documents such as Registration Certificate Book, Vehicle Pollution under Control (PUC) Certificate, Vehicle Insurance Policy. As a solution, we are proposing a Decentralized Application where drivers can upload and access their vehicle documents details using OCR anywhere, anytime digitally. A Quick Response Code (QR-Code) is used to store URL generated by the vehicle owner by uploading the vehicle documents, which can be later scanned by the Traffic Officer for verification purpose. The application notifies the vehicle owner on expiration of any documents that must be renewed. The application helps in reducing the overhead efforts made by the Traffic officers for vehicle verification. The objective of the system is to digitize all documents, ensure authenticity of documents, eliminate the use of fake documents, manage vehicle documents, reduce the workload and time.},

  abstract={Blockchain, pivotal in shaping the metaverse and Web3, often draws criticism for high energy consumption and carbon emission. The rise of sustainability-focused blockchains, especially when intersecting with innovative wireless technologies, revises this predicament. To understand blockchain's role in sustainability, we propose a three-layers structure encapsulating four green utilities: recording and tracking, wide verification, value trading, and concept disseminating. Nori, a decentralized voluntary carbon offset project, serves as our case, illuminating these utilities. Our research unveils unique insights into the on-chain carbon market participants, affect factors of the market, value propositions of NFT-based carbon credits, and the role of social media to spread the concept of carbon offset. We argue that blockchain's contribution to sustainability is significant, with carbon offsetting potentially evolving as a new standard within the blockchain sector.},

  abstract={Nowadays, demand for rental vehicle sharing is increasing. People are preferring to rent vehicles instead of putting a lot of money in a new vehicle. This renting system is beneficial for not only the consumer but also to the owner of the vehicle. Many issues such as theft, use of vehicle, bad condition of vehicles are not considered in the conventional rental systems. With the help of blockchain and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), these issues are resolved in this system. Blockchain has many advantages due to its peer to peer sharing network. Smart contracts in Blockchain technology are contracts that run on their own in which context for the buyer-seller consensus are inscribed directly into the code. This system proposes a smart vehicle rental system which works with Blockchain, CPS and Internet of Things (IoT). The system utilizes IoT sensors to collect automatic data about car usage in real-time. For transactions of both customer and owner, these data make car availability and usage more authentic and credible. The implementation of this system uses Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.JS, Distributed Applications (dApp), Truffle. The proposed rental vehicle system with blockchain provides better reliability, traceability and security to both the owner as well as consumer.},

  abstract={Empowered by blockchain and Web3 technologies, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are able to redefine resources, production relations, and organizational structures in a revolutionary manner. This article aims to reanalyze DAOs from the perspectives of organization and operation, and provide a more precise definition of DAOs as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations. Based on this, the fundamental principles and requirements of DAOs are explained, while the infrastructure based on cyber–physical–social system (CPSS) and parallel intelligence, as well as the supporting technologies, such as digital twins, metaverse, and Web3, are discussed. Besides, a five-layer intelligent architecture is presented, and the closed-loop equation and new function-oriented intelligent algorithms are also proposed. Moreover, the governance mechanisms from the individual, organizational and social perspectives are discussed, and the incentive mechanisms for the human, robot, and digital human are analyzed. This article can be regarded as a stepping stone for further research and developments of DAOs.},

  abstract={Due to the quick increase of IoT devices, they lack the authentication standards and administration needed to keep user data secure. Hackers could cause significant infrastructure harm by infiltrating a wide spectrum of IoT devices. Blockchain use in IoT technology guarantees trust and authentication across all IoT elements, resulting in IoT security. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and shared database that enables the creation of decentralized apps. Traceability, openness, immutability, and fault tolerance are some of the qualities of this technology that help maintain data privacy in IoT scenarios and thus create a safe environment. We look at a potential strategy for securely controlling IoT devices,i.e., devices connected to the internet using smart contracts on the blockchain in this study. This paper demonstrates how the proposed system comprising of a blockchain and smart contracts work efficiently in concurrence to avoid tampering by unauthorized parties. We have employed web3 library to control the linked devices by implementing Ethereum nodes (second most popular blockchain) on Raspberry Pi simulations and node.js.},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Web3, one of the novel paradigms which may drive the evolution of the future Web, is offering an invaluable volume of data stored in the supporting blockchains. Researchers from different fields such as network science, computational social science and data mining, might benefit from these large collections of temporal and heterogeneous data capturing different kinds of interaction among people and between people and the platforms. In this study we focus on a specific issue related to these modern techno-social systems, i.e. the understanding of the rules driving their growth. To reach this goal, we performed an analysis based on graph evolution rules - GERs - on different networks gathered from Web3 platforms such as Steemit or OpenSea. Graph evolution rules mining is a frequency-based method for evaluating network evolution which does not require any prior growth process for disentangling how networks evolve. By comparing the evolution rules of social network platforms and asset trading services through GER profiles, we observe that some evolution rules are common to all Web3 platforms, regardless of the system specificity. On the other hand, in specific cases, the frequency of graph evolution rules is influenced by the nature of the platform: whereas social and token-transfer networks are characterized by rules which increase network transitivity and reciprocity, NFT trading networks, especially those specialized in a specific type of digital asset, are driven by rules which form trading chains. These findings suggest that the GER approach and the GER profiles are a good starting point to get insights into the evolutionary behavior of a network and to define a classification of graph evolution rules.},
