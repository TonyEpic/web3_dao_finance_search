 abstract = {In recent years, permissionless blockchains have gained significant attention for their ability to secure and provide transparency in transactions. The development of blockchain technology has shifted from cryptocurrency to decentralized finance, benefiting millions of unbanked individuals, and serving as the foundation of Web3, which aims to provide the next generation of the internet with data ownership for users. The rise of NFTs has also helped artists and creative workers to protect their intellectual property and reap the benefits of their work. However, privacy risks associated with permissionless blockchains have become a major concern for individuals and institutions. The role of blockchain in the transition from Web2 to Web3 is crucial, as it is rapidly evolving. As more individuals, institutions, and organizations adopt this technology, it becomes increasingly important to closely monitor the new risks associated with permissionless blockchains and provide updated solutions to mitigate them. This paper endeavors to examine the privacy risks inherent in permissionless blockchains, including Remote Procedure Call (RPC) issues, Ethereum Name Service (ENS), miner extractable value (MEV) bots, on-chain data analysis, data breaches, transaction linking, transaction metadata, and others. The existing solutions to these privacy risks, such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, Hyperledger Fabric, and stealth addresses, shall be analyzed. Finally, suggestions for the future improvement of privacy solutions in the permissionless blockchain space shall be put forward.},

 abstract = {The advancements of the metaverse has validated a new world of possibilities with Web2 and Web3 technologies that are increasingly immersive, interconnected, spatial and decentralized. One of the key Web3 technologies that is intersecting with the metaverse is blockchain technology, that has now imbued metaverse worlds and platform as what are now identified as Layer-1 and Layer-2 metaverse, and in tandem the intersecting of decentralized Web3 technologies including but not limited to metaverse currencies and cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens and tokenization, marketplaces, digital wallets, and blockchain main and side-chain networks. In combination with interoperable and interconnected avatars, the metaverse is evolving beyond phygital experiences and asset architecting into financial experiences and asset trading. This research paper investigates the intersections between the metaverse and Web3 emerging technologies by firstly conducting a systematic literature review of the metaverse and its intersection with emerging technologies which currently has a dearth in academic and research literature despite the developments of the Web3 metaverse and its Layer-1 Layer-2 protocol. The review is followed by pilot-testing the metaverse platforms intersecting with Web3 technologies in real-world, particularly on the use of buy-and-sell, trading and item ownership under decentralized finance and financial technology. Finally, the research assesses the resulting metaverse based on user reviews and experiences on the feasibility of Web3 metaverse. The intersection of Web3 and the metaverse is still an early adoption of IR4.0 emerging technologies, yet the convergence of the metaverse, blockchain technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence is ultimately the precursor to the future Web4.},

 abstract = {Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers a range of financial instruments and services that leverage the capabilities of web3 technology. Maker protocol, which enables users to obtain loans backed by cryptocurrencies, is one of them. Unlike traditional banks, Maker’s data is transparently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. In this research paper, we focus on analyzing the lending aspect of Maker from a traditional finance perspective. To achieve this, we create a unique dataset with loan portfolios from the MakerDAO project, making it the first dataset of its kind in the DeFi field. This publicly available dataset contains essential financial characteristics related to borrowing, including balance, loss given default, annual equivalent rate, and probability of default. Additionally, we develop a specialized mathematical model tailored specifically to this project. This model allows us to estimate the probability of default by considering the presence of crypto-collateral and utilizing Brownian motion passage levels. The results of this study provide valuable insights into lending practices in DeFi projects. They also help bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based financial services.},

 abstract = {Technology has advanced and with it, cybercrime has become a reality. The rise of Web3 technology aims to decentralize the internet and create a trustless network of smart contracts, leading to the limitation of conventional identification systems. Blockchain technology provides a solution to security concerns by instilling trust in end-users' minds. In this project, a blockchain-based identification system will be created using SoulBound Tokens. These NFT-like tokens cannot be transferred after minting, making them immutable and secure. Third parties can request users' credentials, which can be easily verified through the blockchain's transparent chain of custody. This approach creates a secure and reliable identification system that protects users' data and assets from malicious actors. This concept extends to finance, healthcare, and government services. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we can create a more secure environment for individuals and institutions.},

 abstract = {The implementation of blockchain technology by various businesses has gained impetus at the same time as within the finance area it is achieving new heights progressively. To generate a distributed ledger a blockchain (data structure) is utilized. Basically, a blockchain is a collection of (a page of a ledger or record book) i.e. blocks in a sequential fashion. A record book holds all dealings, timestamps, the hash value of the preceding block, record book compensation, record book number, and others. Each single record book holds a hash value of the preceding record book or block, therefore making a series of record books accompanying one another. In this research work, while discovering these DApps, we will discover them at a stage that is sufficient to comprehend in what way they work and manage various concerns. In this research work, we will deliberate and recognize Blockchain arrangement, how Ethereum works, writing smart contracts, the introduction of web3.js, and wallet services. Finally, we put forward promising clarifications in detail for improving the safety of the distributed ledger for industrialized applications},

 abstract = {With the continuous development of web technology, Web3.0 has attracted a considerable amount of attention due to its unique decentralized characteristics. The digital economy is an important driver of high-quality economic development and is currently in a rapid development stage. In the digital economy scenario, the centralized nature of the Internet and other characteristics usually bring about security issues such as infringement and privacy leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how to use Web3.0 technologies to solve the pain points encountered in the development of the digital economy by fully exploring the critical technologies of digital economy and Web3.0. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of Web3.0 that should be integrated with the digital economy to better find the entry point to solve the problems by examining the latest advances of Web3.0 in machine learning, finance, and data management. We hope this research will inspire those who are involved in both academia and industry, and finally help to build a favourable ecology for the digital economy.},

 abstract = {In our study, we have evaluated the impact of tweets, social indicators, uncertainty, and attention indices on the selected variables calculated from a pool of 51 decentralised finance entities. In so doing, we have identified some evidence that returns are impacted by tweets, but not by social indicators that appear to be more relevant for volatility. We have further confirmed that the S&P500 Index negatively influences cryptocurrency returns, which means that these two asset classes are substitutes. Uncertainty and attention indices are relevant in determining returns and the alternative measurement of volatility. However, they remain insignificant for illiquidity and our initial volatility choice.},
