 abstract = {The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

 abstract = {We study the competition between blockchains in a multi-chain environment, where a dominant EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) co-exists with an alternative EVM-compatible (e.g., Avalanche) and an EVM-incompatible (e.g., Algorand) blockchain. While EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum users and developers to migrate more easily over to the alternative layer-1, EVM incompatibility might allow the firms to build more loyal and "sticky'' user base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such, the choice to be EVM-compatible is not merely a technological decision, but also an important strategic decision. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and find that at equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain. To avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice can take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network effects. We find that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract users through direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract users through offering better features/products.},

By combining blockchain, IoT and tokenomics, DePINs are expected to disrupt existing IoT business models and enable Web3 communities to build innovative, machine-driven and decentralized IoT networks and applications. Due to the characteristics of DePINs such as the large number of smart devices and network scale as well as the interactions with blockchain, scalability remains to be one of the key challenges. In this position paper, we outline the core ideas and components for building a rollup-centric scalable architecture for DePINs. The proposed architecture takes a modular design approach and leverages off-chain computing and zero-knowledge proofs to address the scalability challenge. This work is expected to highlight the importance of this new research direction and shed some light on potential solutions.},

 abstract = {The music industry faces numerous challenges regarding tracking and distributing royalties. This article explores how a decentralized and transparent system for managing music royalties can be created with a smart contract implementation on the Polygon network, utilizing Chainlink oracles. By enhancing the efficiency and transparency of royalty distribution, this groundbreaking smart contract has the potential to revolutionize the music industry and stand as a blueprint for diverse sectors grappling with analogous challenges in intellectual property rights and revenue allocation. At its core, this smart contract, functioning on the bedrock of blockchain, ensures meticulous oversight of financial transactions between consumers and content creators. It streamlines the process and facilitates the collection of user view statistics crucial for strategic fund allocation. With the potential impact of transaction fees on the user experience of blockchain payments, a new solution has been developed that includes a payment channel that reserves significant amounts of funds and enables off-chain payments through specialized messages. By combining these technological advancements, we are taking a transformative step towards a more seamless and fair future in the complex world of royalty management. The application is structured into conventional backend and frontend segments, with the code available on Github.},

A core challenge for such systems is model training and pipeline monitoring/management while not revealing sensitive data or introducing new attack points. Innovative solutions that reveal network structure and topology are often in conflict with security/privacy design principles. In this paper, we consider the system communication between sensors, edge, and the cloud that does not reveal the origin source or destination of the data. A core contribution is how to apply Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to decentralized architectures that are not under the direct control of a service provider. The aim is to decouple the Machine Learning (ML) solution, data platform, and sensors while avoiding service level degradation. We utilize an unlinkable end-to-end encrypted asynchronous communication protocol called Whisper that is based on the Ethereum blockchain to achieve sender and receiver anonymity. The Whisper protocol provides a level of darkness that maintains anonymity in communication.},

 abstract = {Lack of trustworthiness, access policy flexibility, and user privacy preservation in centralized access control systems raise numerous security issues and reduce the collaboration maturity of global data sharing systems. In this paper, we propose a Self-Sovereign Identity-based, Decentralized, and Dynamic (SSIDD) access control system. SSIDD utilizes blockchain technologies to build trust for untrusted data sharing networks and ensures user privacy. Our access control provides high access policy flexibility and security for global inter-enterprise collaborations from a diverse industrial environment. SSIDD authenticates its users based on their Decentralized Identifiers (DID), which are under control of users and can be resolved into a DID document stored on the blockchain. Our data management technology keeps the data sharing systems safe against issues such as data breaches, identity thefts, and privacy violations. Besides, the authorization process of SSIDD is dynamic by adopting several smart contracts. The transparency of rules and agreements in smart contracts and the traceability of records on blockchain ledger provide a high level of security and trust. For proof of concept, we have developed and evaluated a prototype of SSIDD. Our evaluations show that the throughput and latency of our method are within an acceptable range.},

 abstract = {Web3, one of the novel paradigms which may drive the evolution of the future Web, is offering an invaluable volume of data stored in the supporting blockchains. Researchers from different fields such as network science, computational social science and data mining, might benefit from these large collections of temporal and heterogeneous data capturing different kinds of interaction among people and between people and the platforms. In this study we focus on a specific issue related to these modern techno-social systems, i.e. the understanding of the rules driving their growth. To reach this goal, we performed an analysis based on graph evolution rules - GERs - on different networks gathered from Web3 platforms such as Steemit or OpenSea. Graph evolution rules mining is a frequency-based method for evaluating network evolution which does not require any prior growth process for disentangling how networks evolve. By comparing the evolution rules of social network platforms and asset trading services through GER profiles, we observe that some evolution rules are common to all Web3 platforms, regardless of the system specificity. On the other hand, in specific cases, the frequency of graph evolution rules is influenced by the nature of the platform: whereas social and token-transfer networks are characterized by rules which increase network transitivity and reciprocity, NFT trading networks, especially those specialized in a specific type of digital asset, are driven by rules which form trading chains. These findings suggest that the GER approach and the GER profiles are a good starting point to get insights into the evolutionary behavior of a network and to define a classification of graph evolution rules.},

 abstract = {This article proposes a novel parallel management mode based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for enterprises by utilizing the artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution (ACP) approach, parallel intelligence theory, and blockchain technologies, to realize the distributed management of an enterprise. The artificial enterprise DAO (EnDAO) corresponding to the actual enterprise is constructed, and they constitute a parallel system via virtual–real interaction and parallel execution. Through the non-fungible token (NFT)-based incentive mechanism, metaverse-based virtual learning and training, as well as DAO-based distributed management and decision-making, the management and control of the actual enterprise as well as its employees can be carried out. By virtue of the virtual–real interactions of three types of employees, as well as the virtual–real feedback of three closed loops in the parallel systems, DAO-based parallel management for enterprises can realize descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence. On this basis, this article takes the recruitment-oriented key performance indicator (KPI) management of a startup technology enterprise as the case to introduce the operation processes and illustrate the superiorities of the proposed DAO-based enterprise parallel management mode.},

 abstract = {In order to reduce limitations and as a practical substitute for voting on paper, electronic voting has developed gradually as a feasible alternative. The last decade's worth of related studies implies that, building a secure e-voting system using web 2.0 technology that assures the integrity of the votes while also giving transparency has been a long-standing difficulty. In a network of centralized systems, a single party has the right to administer data sources. Since the centralized voting systems are more vulnerable to data manipulation issues, the trust has faded in the voters on behalf of the entire process. In this paper authors discuss the solution with blockchain which is secured. The proposed implementation is ideal for small or medium-scale elections, and this includes several basic components of our methodology in three fictitious modules: the administrative module, the Voters module, and the Blockchain module. Node JS, Ganache, and Web3 JS are used as the main technologies. In conclusion, it is expected to implement a secure system for conducting web-based digital voting that ensures the integrity of the votes registered. Furthermore, it intends to enhance the system in the future to accommodate large-scale elections with a viable solution to the blockchain trilemma issues.},

 abstract = {Individual medical records have a high priority of integrity and security, yet they are vulnerable to data breaches and manipulation. It’s vital to communicate these data in a secure and safe manner. To overcome this problem, the proposed solution named, CoreMedi, uses blockchain technology to store and share medical data. Data stored on blockchain is immutable, verifiable and transparent (based on accessibility). As data cannot be altered on blockchain, the rate of fraud may be drastically decreased. With the help of smart contracts which are small pieces of code that run on blockchain, a Decentralized Application (DApps) is designed and implemented that enables patients/individuals to store and share medical records securely. Users may share their medical history, medications, and personal data with a specific medical personnel on the same blockchain network using CoreMedi, a Decentralized Web application. The application is implemented with React as frontend and the backend infrastructure uses Ethereum solidity smart contracts. The process of running a blockchain application is not simple because the users must be willing to spend crytpocurrencies as gas fees, as this is the way to maintain the network with no single organization having control.},

 abstract = {At present, the concept of metaverse has sparked widespread attention from the public to major industries. With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.},

 abstract = {Git has been the de-facto version control system for the Software Development industry. Although Git is distributed, developers’ tools for collaboration, such as GitHub, are centralized entities owned by large corporations such as Microsoft. The centralization creates trust and privacy issues for software development companies (preserving their intellectual property), along with a significant" single point of failure" issue. In addition, such centralized systems are susceptible to Sybil and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks due to the presence of malicious individuals. Blockchain technology has many key characteristics (such as decentralization, transparency, immutability, and audibility), solving these centralization issues. However, the requirement of having a storage system to store the user’s repositories over the blockchain creates a scalability issue (in terms of storage). Most importantly, it makes data (code) privacy more severe due to its open nature. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized alternative solution and framework named "DCGit" powered by Web3 technologies such as the Ethereum Blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to provide security and scalability yet user-friendly collaboration for software development.},

 abstract = {The world of web3 is currently being plagued by security risks. In the first half of 2022 alone, web3 projects have lost more than $2 billion due to various security issues, out of which more than 76% of the projects have been audited. At present, the main attack surfaces on the web3 chain, including oracle manipulation, logical loopholes across smart contracts and MEV front-running transactions, cannot be defended through the current mainstream security methods, such as contract auditing, and can only be passively defended after receiving the alerts of malicious attacks. Hence, there is a huge demand for more proactive defense products in the market. However, most of the existing security products and security defense solutions are limited in defense capabilities, as they rely on external mechanisms and thus cannot effectively identify and counter hacker attacks during the contract execution. This paper proposes a new security system for smart contracts on the blockchain and demonstrates how it can actively defend against malicious attacks and provide effective protection for assets on the blockchain through experimental verification and comparison. It compares the existing on-chain security verification solutions as well as the engineering development model and performs logic-based argument verification during on-chain transaction execution and high-precision computation-intensive verification in the off-chain sandbox environment, thereby can prevent risky transactions, protect assets, and promote the security and development of the entire web3.},

Combining the latest VR/AR related virtual reality technology, the application scenarios are linked to the decentralized servers, which greatly increase the accessibility of Metaverse. By using the blockchain browser to access the dapp, the accessibility of the content is further improved. More virtual worlds can be developed in combination with the actual application scenarios. Users can closely participate in the re development of the scenarios to achieve user centered essential services. In the application of the meta universe, smart contracts enable the economic development of virtual scenes with tokens. As the underlying network structure of the meta universe, the blockchain network is landing at an unprecedented speed. It is developing the meta universe in the network structure logic related to digital wallets, distributed autonomous organizations (DAOs), distributed storage, decentralized public transactions, and heterogeneous authentication (NFT). It has multiple advantages. First, it realizes participation in predictable scenarios and reduces labor consumption. Sec ond, the interaction process realized the alternation of reality and virtual, and increased diversified creation. Third, use device terminals and mobile terminals to access applications, accelerate point-to-point interaction, and achieve decentralized services.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, demand for rental vehicle sharing is increasing. People are preferring to rent vehicles instead of putting a lot of money in a new vehicle. This renting system is beneficial for not only the consumer but also to the owner of the vehicle. Many issues such as theft, use of vehicle, bad condition of vehicles are not considered in the conventional rental systems. With the help of blockchain and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), these issues are resolved in this system. Blockchain has many advantages due to its peer to peer sharing network. Smart contracts in Blockchain technology are contracts that run on their own in which context for the buyer-seller consensus are inscribed directly into the code. This system proposes a smart vehicle rental system which works with Blockchain, CPS and Internet of Things (IoT). The system utilizes IoT sensors to collect automatic data about car usage in real-time. For transactions of both customer and owner, these data make car availability and usage more authentic and credible. The implementation of this system uses Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.JS, Distributed Applications (dApp), Truffle. The proposed rental vehicle system with blockchain provides better reliability, traceability and security to both the owner as well as consumer.},

 abstract = {Web3 represents an evolution of the centralized and siloed topology of Web2 by focusing on more connected, decentralized, and open technology to democratize data and services between databases, tools, devices, people, teams and organizations to provide secure single sources of truth on decentralized trust lay-ers. However, sensitive data, such as intellectual property, classified information, personal data, or medical records, cannot be distributed to those without explicit access. A standard solution is to encrypt the data before uploading and then distribute the decryption key to select persons. This solution does not sufficiently protect against data leakage. In addition, legal, contractual, and GDPR requirements are not met in current Web3 systems. This study suggests critical requirements for any Web3 system that targets sensitive data, private and permissioned needs, and enterprise and governmental applications. A preliminary framework is then introduced for building compliant Web3 systems to the suggested requirements. The study proposes changes to the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) protocol, with the main change being that each request checks against a ledger if the requestor has access to the data. Two novel Ethereum smart contracts, Enterprise Architecture and Smart Legal Contract, are presented to meet the suggested requirements.},

 abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry's crucial task is to look after the medicines while they are being transported, by ensuring ideal storage conditions and keeping track of the complete medications sent to prevent risky scenarios. These three classifications are used by WHO: falsified, substandard, and unregistered/unlicensed. The need for sophisticated tools to identify fabricated pharmaceuticals will rise as criminals grow craftier. To identify phoney and substandard drugs, new technologies are continually being developed. A substantial lack of transparency in the current system makes it difficult for patients to understand the cost of acquired medications, making counterfeit drugs a prime issue. Moreover, if there are accusations of illegal or unethical behaviours, it could be difficult to look into supply chain tampering. The blockchain technology was employed. Two parties' transactions can be efficiently and permanently recorded using an open, distributed ledger like blockchain. Blockchains are transparent, decentralized, distributed, and unchangeable, which makes them an ideal solution for the problem of fake medications. This study proposes a mechanism for the safe distribution of medications throughout the whole supply chain. Each product in the chain can be moved between chain associates who have been confirmed using an event request-response approach. A product may be traced back to its source thanks to smart contracts, which are used to record all transactions between entities onto the blockchain. A DApp is made using the React Framework. On a local blockchain that Ganache provided, the smart contracts were put into action. The blockchain connection between the DApp and Web3.js is made possible by the Truffle framework. The outcomes of the studies show that our method is practical and marginally more secure than existing solutions.},

Web 1.0 focused on serving static pages is considered as the read-only web, whereas web 2.0 made way for dynamic pages making it as read-write web, which is predominantly experienced. The main problem face here is, as the users of E-commerce applications, is single-point-of-failure (SPOF), which means, the data stored in centralized servers is highly susceptible and vulnerable to attacks. Now, the internet's next evolution enables to develop decentralized applications and adds few other features like trustlessness, distributed, transparent, robust, etc. This also makes web 3.0 as read-write-own web. Now, this evolution wave of decentralization has hit the applications. To overcome this problem, this study has proposed a solution to completely decentralize the E-Commerce platform by using Blockchain in conjunction with smart contracts and utilizes the decentralized storage like IPFS (Inter Planetary File System).

Modern centralised digital marketplaces and enterprises provide consumers with an alternative method of selling and purchasing items conveniently. However, disadvantages among the marketplaces include the platform’s potential to arbitrarily block merchants, the fees associated with listing and selling products on the site, and the lack of user data privacy. In this, we propose and demonstrate a decentralised application that takes advantage of the Ethereum blockchain to address all these issues. The Truffle development framework was employed in the creation of the application. An Ethereum smart contract later migrated to the Ethereum network comprised the application’s features. The web3.js API (Application Program Interface) was used to send the user’s input to the Ethereum network after being received through a web interface. The users involved will be able to do transactions with the help of an interactive user interface. The interfacing is done using the Truffle framework, and the transactions are made through MetaMask, where ETH tokens are used. The dApp is created using JavaScript and React JS library. Thus, the integration of the blockchain and with front-end application by interfacing it with web 3.0 helps create a secured, immutable, trusted, and easy-to-use e-commerce website.},

 abstract = {In recent years, Blockchain-based Online Social Media (BOSM) platforms have evolved fast due to the advancement of blockchain technology. BOSM can effectively overcome the problems of traditional social media platforms, such as a single point of trust and insufficient incentives for users, by combining a decentralized governance structure and a cryptocurrency-based incentive model, thereby attracting a large number of users and making it a crucial component of Web3. BOSM allows users to downvote low-quality content and aims to decrease the visibility of low-quality content by sorting and filtering it through downvoting. However, this feature may be maliciously exploited by some users to undermine the fairness of the incentive, reduce the quality of highly visible content, and further reduce users’ enthusiasm for content creation and the attractiveness of the platform. In this paper, we study and analyze the downvoting behavior using four years of data collected from Steemit, the largest BOSM platform. We discovered that a significant number of bot accounts were actively downvoting content. In addition, we discovered that roughly 9% of the downvoting activity might be retaliatory. We did not detect any significant instances of downvoting on content for a specific topic. We believe that the findings in this paper will facilitate the future development of user behavior analysis and incentive pattern design in BOSM and Web3.},

The key feature of the Web3 metaverse is that the ownership of digital assets is recorded by non-fungible token (NFT) protocol on the blockchain. Thus, users are better encouraged to construct Web3 metaverse due to the ownership of their user-generated content (UGC). However, the existing UGC editors mainly face two challenges: they cannot guarantee the uniqueness of UGC; and they are hard-pressed to find a trade-off between model granularity and 3D modeling difficulty. In this article, we design a novel UGC editor for the Web3 metaverse, named MetaCube, to address these challenges. MetaCube applies an artificial intelligence (AI) method to assist the UGC creation for decreasing the 3D modeling difficulty while maintaining the model granularity. To guarantee the uniqueness of UGC, this article proposes 3D Crypto-dropout, a specially designed dropout that can utilize user information to control the UGC creation process and generate unique fine-grained 3D models. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3D Crypto-dropout can effectively guarantee the uniqueness of UGC from both numerical and human-centered evaluation. Moreover, the existing challenges and open research topics for the uniqueness of UGC are also profoundly discussed.},

Recently, to provide intelligent service for Web3 users, artificial intelligence applications have been booming, thus generating enormous deep learning models. These models are supposed to be deployed in the edge due to their massive computation. Further-more, edge servers may face overload and intolerable delay for the high concurrency of offloaded deep learning tasks. How to determine an optimal offloading decision in the highly dynamic and heterogeneous edge-cloud environment is still a challenge. To tackle the mentioned challenge, a dynamic offloading strategy based on game theory combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) partition for vehicular edge networks, named GPOV, is proposed. Specifically, CNN partition can utilize resources more efficiently and reduce the delay with parallelism. The game theoretic offloading decision strategy can determine the optimal offloading policy according to the real-time environment. The performance of our strategy is validated in the final part of this article.},

 abstract = {With the explosive development of technology and Internet communication, it has become an inevitable trend to realize the secure storage and sharing of electronic medical data among hospitals. In recent researches, there are also many problems in realizing secure storage and sharing of electronic medical data, such as "data silos", leakage of patient sensitive information due to data sharing and having no reliability about the original data uploaded by patients. To solve the above problems, we propose a blockchain-based medical data storage and secure sharing scheme. In the scheme, we utilize IPFS-based Web3.Storage for medical data storage, propose a sensitivity classification and access control strategy for sensitive data leakage and present a blockchain-based original data reliability checking strategy to check the reliability of the original data. Our scheme is explained in detail in the paper, and the performance analysis of this scheme is carried out to prove the feasibility of this scheme.},

In this paper, we make use of the referable NFT (rNFT11In this work, rNFT mainly refers to the EIP-5521 protocol and corresponding formed network/topology [1], while NFT is used in the context of a single node, node sets, or products that align with the EIP-5521 protocol.) standard [2], indexed EIP-5521, to construct an rNFT classification framework leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN), an emerging branch of Deep Learning (DL), which learns on the inherent topology of graph-based data. In particular, we first transform the rNFT backward and onward reference relationship to a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and model appropriate node and edge features from rNFT metadata and associated token transactions. Next, a multi-layer GraphSage model is designed to include the collected features for the learning process. In this way, the model takes into account graph topology together with features to classify both the existing and incoming NFT nodes in a supervised way. We also give comprehensive elaboration on the architecture of the new GNN-based recommender system with discussions in regard to its characteristics and challenges. Furthermore, we expect to conduct extensive experiments, by presenting an initial plan, to show the feasibility and efficacy of our system.},

All the existing F aaS systems are owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. While this is not an issue for most existing enterprise applications, such character is not compatible with the decentralization principle of dApp/Web3 applications, more of which are being deployed in the cloud environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a decentralized FaaS, which is managed by multiple cloud service providers and allows a decentralized application to take advantages of FaaS. In this research paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system for managing decentralized FaaS using blockchain technology and decentralized API management, where functions are executed on a distributed network of nodes by multi-cloud data centers, rather than on a centralized server. This allows for greater scalability and flexibility, as well as improved security and reliability.},

 abstract = {Decentralization promises to remedy the drawbacks of the web by executing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchains. Unfortunately, modern blockchains cannot support realistic web application workloads mainly due to congestion.We introduce the Smart Redbelly Blockchain (SRBB), a provably correct permissionless blockchain that reduces congestion by (1) avoiding redundant propagation and validations of transactions with Transaction Validation and Propagation Reduction (TVPR) and (2) mitigating the propagation of invalid transactions within blocks by Byzantine nodes with a dedicated Reward-Penalty Mechanism (RPM). Our comparison of SRBB against Algorand, Avalanche, Diem, Ethereum, Quorum, and Solana, using the DIABLO benchmark suite, indicates that SRBB outperforms all these blockchains under real application workloads. Moreover, SRBB is the only blockchain to successfully execute real workloads of NASDAQ and Uber on a DApp without losing transactions. To demonstrate that TVPR and RPM are the causes of the improved performance, we compare SRBB with its naive baseline, which does not contain TVPR and RPM. Our results show that TVPR increases the throughput by 55× and divides the latency by 3.5, while RPM increases the throughput by 7% under flooding attacks. Finally, TVPR helps reduce transaction losses in the normal scenario while RPM goes further and mitigates transaction losses under flooding attacks.},

This also helps authenticate the provenance of products which is an added value that can be monetized by the supply chain participants. Nonetheless, due to the transparent nature of the blockchain, privacy and confidentiality are still a major concern for industries. In this paper, we present zk-BeSC, a blockchain enabled supply chain scheme based on zero-knowledge proofs of polynomials. The scheme allows transactions between supply chain participants in a privacy preserving fashion. It also offers tamper-resistance and replication due to the intrinsic nature of the blockchain.

Therefore, current identity management approaches will define how these interactions will look in the future, but different fields and communities often approach management with their own solutions and tools, despite their similarities. This includes decentralized digital identities, where the identity is managed with asymmetric cryptographic keys, and no centralized entity oversees the whole identity system. This paper focuses on managing on- and off-chain decentralized digital identities, with the former being used for blockchain networks and the latter for self-sovereignty and privacy. While both types of decentralized identity build on the same cryptographic and identity primitives, there is no single wallet that handles both. Therefore, this paper proposes an orchestration solution for both wallet types, which enables their convergence to a single universal wallet and validates it with a real-life decentralized identity use case.},

This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that is an emerging technology currently disrupting various fields. The aim of this paper is to explore ways to harness the advantages of blockchain while being implemented to existing systems. A permissioned blockchain can be established through Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) that utilizes ledgers that are interacted upon by a chaincode. An HLF network was established to investigate the custom chaincode. The scenario of the project was grounded on the functions performed in a web-based property inventory management system that uses a centralized database. The chaincode in the project was written using JavaScript and Node.js was used to create the whole chaincode source. A channel was built between the nodes of the blockchain where the chaincode was deployed. Subsequently, to open a gateway to the network, multiple Representational State Transfer (RST) Application Programming Interface (API) were created. Several gateway endpoints were tested through Insomnia, a cross-platform API client for RST. The tests performed employed various request methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) which resulted in evidence that the custom chaincode is fully functional and adheres to the OpenAPI specification. The paper concludes that it is highly feasible and advantageous to integrate a blockchain into an existing Web 2.0 system. Most functions and business logic in existing traditional systems can be reflected in a chaincode with proper planning and execution. In the future, other aspects of the blockchain network will be explored further.},

The development of blockchain technology has shifted from cryptocurrency to decentralized finance, benefiting millions of unbanked individuals, and serving as the foundation of Web3, which aims to provide the next generation of the internet with data ownership for users. The rise of NFTs has also helped artists and creative workers to protect their intellectual property and reap the benefits of their work.

To support the development of Web3, privacy-preserving decentralized data computing schemes need to be studied. In earlier works, blockchain was used for trusted data sharing. However, due to the lack of computing attribute, blockchain is not capable enough to ensure the trustworthiness of the distributed computing process. Besides, the distributed computing method requires a large amount of data transmission and the current privacy protection researches seldom consider the problem of user privacy. In this article, we design a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving distributed data computing architecture to break-through the limitations of existing researches. The proposed architecture ensures the secure and trustworthy computing with state channel and computing sandbox. We also design a sandbox location obfuscation method based on onion routing technology, making it difficult for attackers to identify the sandbox location or infer user privacy.

Generally, Web3 is decentralized and semantic depending on user behavior, and thus the zero-trust architecture should be created initially. To hasten its arrival, a comprehensive discussion on its architecture and enabling technologies is inspired. Specifically, to access Web3, it is essential to study how to establish an identity management system. Meanwhile, for resource description and data verification, it is necessary to set up decentralized identifiers (DID), and link the data to identifiers in the form of DID document. In particular, a decentralized network operating system is an indispensable underlying technology for Web3, incorporating concepts such as decentralization and user-driven philosophy. Therefore, the corresponding technologies for the operating system such as blockchain and distributed ledger technology should be further studied and developed. Moreover, in order to reduce the consensus cost, a large-scale incentive mechanism is also the basis of long-term sustainability, which can attract and motivate distributed players to participate in the maintenance of Web3. Last but not the least, Web3 is built on a physical infrastructure relying on communication, networking, storage and computing, which is crucial to establishing an effective and secure Web3. This encourages us to study communication, networking, storage and computing in Web3, as well as the specific requirements of running Web3.},

 abstract = {Web3 is a blockchain-powered web evolution. In many situations, Web3 smart contracts require data from outside their applications (off-chain data) via APIs to function as designed. Existing APIs in Web3 facing the most common and critical risks originate through access control vulnerabilities (i.e., Broken Object Level Authorization, Broken Function Level Authorization, and Broken Authentication). Such vulnerabilities during runtime cannot be spotted during the development and testing phases of a Web3 application that integrates APIs. Continuous monitoring is the key to proactive hunting access control attacks, which are not attainable through manual monitoring. In this paper, we design a real-time automated security monitoring approach named the access behavior learning (ABL) model for early detection and prevention of access control attacks before they could cause any damage. In two steps, the ABL approach predicts an attacker's access behavior in response to environmental behavior. First, it verifies the API providers and oracle by defining authentication schemes using OpenAPI Specification (OAS) standard to identify the API endpoints to endorse authenticity. In addition, it validates the oracle-level authentication security schemes for approving authentication. Second, it scans metadata for the current access record and compares it with the previous access records, such as location, application id, and API key, to form a baseline that determines authentication. Using this baseline, ABL determines legitimate application access based on both factors for identifying its authentication. ABL approach retains API security by designing an efficient correlation to enable complex off-chain computation by predicting API access attacks. The ABL approach is evaluated against different Web3 applications with varying levels of access control vulnerabilities where applied for early attack detection and prevention. Compared to traditional manual detection processes, the ABL approach offers early automated detection and prevention of attacks during runtime, which results in enhanced security measures and reduces the risk of potential threats.},

Ditto uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to extract similarity signatures and records from content, which are stored on a decentralised index on top of a distributed hash table (DHT). Ditto uniquely supports numerous underlying content networks and types, and supports various use-cases, including keyword-search. Our evaluation shows that our system is feasible and that our search quality, delay, and overhead are comparable to those currently accepted by users of DWeb and search systems.},

Real estate investment has been a proven hedge against inflation over many decades. The Real Estate sector despite so much contribution to the financial system has seen relatively less innovation in terms of technology. Blockchain has shown a great affinity towards managing real estate properties and all the transactions involved. Investment in this sector usually requires huge capital as a result, small retail investors are not able to invest. This is where Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) comes to the rescue of retail investors. This paper focuses on the ERC721M token standard and proposed architecture as to how a REIT company can make use of ERC721M to design their Decentralized Asset organization, or simply DAO, which will help them in adapting web3 technologies and bring automation in their procedure of operations with maximum transparency, We have also done a comparative analysis of ERC721Mv/s Standard Deployment and why ERC721M is the best token standard to be suited for creating smart contract interface for such an operation.},

Web3 is the internet religious fundamentalism for data rights owned by users based on identity, data, network, and service, which requires the support of full-process data protection provided by a zero-trust and zero-touch environment. However, as to the traditional layered architecture like TCP/IP, data protection is an overlaid function, which is far away from the full-process data protection requirements. To this end, in order to build a zero-trust and zero-touch environment, a Web3 architecture is presented in this article as a promising paradigm. Meanwhile, the key principles for Web3 architecture designing are discussed, covering interoperability and interpretability of data, trustworthiness throughout network lifecycle, incentive for collaboration and sharing, and human-centric experience. Moreover, in order to achieve these principles, four aspects of enabling technologies are presented, including semantic, incentive, decentralized, and spatial technologies. Finally, some main challenges and open issues are also identified as a future direction for further work.},

However, user migration phenomena have not been fully understood and their driving mechanisms are still not well identified; in particular, the behaviors of hubs and the influence they exert on their followers are unclear. In this work, we focus on these aspects by analyzing the propensity of hubs to migrate towards a new social platform as a consequence of a shocking event; and the influence they exert on the decision of their neighbors of migrating to a new platform or staying on the native one. We conducted analysis on data made available after a user migration consequence of a hard fork involving two Web3 online social networks based on the blockchains Steem and Hive. Due to the blockchain nature of these Web3 platforms, we got detailed data about social and financial interactions among the users, along with information that allowed a precise reconstruction of the context surrounding the migration. The main findings suggest that different types of hubs apply different strategies when choosing to migrate, e.g. financial hubs diversify their strategy by staying and migrating at the same time. As for hub influence, results suggest that users directly interacting with hubs tend to migrate. In general, findings on influence indicate that understanding the activity and the influence of hubs is crucial in monitoring and controlling the user migration process.},

In traditional online markets, buying and selling are performed in a centralized manner, which, in addition to the problems of centralized systems, also brings the challenge of users’ trust. One of the challenges in online markets is maintaining the privacy and not revealing the exchanged file to unauthorized entities. Another challenge is to have a mechanism to detect fraud in the market. If the wrong file or key is sent by the seller, the fraud detection mechanism guaranties that the smart contract will be informed and the buyer will be refunded. On the other hand, the seller will be paid if a correct file and its corresponding key have been sent.Blockchain network is not suitable for file storing. Therefore, there are centralized or decentralized methods to store files in building a blockchain based file sharing market. In this work, we selected a distributed file system storage called IPFS (InterPlanetary File system). We integrated IPFS network with a suitable smart contract which is deployed on Ethereum blockchain. We provided a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any dispute that happens between market users.},

However, data integrity is a concern as cloud service providers (CSPs) often cannot guarantee it. Blockchain technology offers a solution to guarantee data integrity and traceability. However, the immutability of traditional blockchain conflicts with GDPR's requirements. To address scalability and privacy concerns, we have designed a comprehensive scheme that integrates the redactable blockchain with the existing revocable IPFS mechanism. Our scheme overcomes the disadvantage of residual downloading information in the traditional blockchain. Additionally, we have developed an enhanced proxy re-encryption scheme that simplifies access control for physicians without the need for complex group key management. Unlike traditional blockchains and P2P file sharing systems, our PHR platform allows for selective removal of records and files while maintaining auditable logs. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively enhances the exclusive revocation feature with acceptable overheads. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide the merit of fully complete record and file revocation on a blockchain-based system.},

A smart contract is an agreement in the form of a cryptographic code digitally signed by the actors. This technology holds the data transaction transparently and securely. The actors may benefit without intermediaries involved in the transaction. Supply chain management will be easily tracked by decentralized data sharing. Supply chain management involves transactions in agricultural sectors such as farmers, village cooperatives units, distributors, and consumers. The Cooperative is a party that buys goods from farmers and sells them to consumers. A smart contract is a digital signature that can access the system in transactions. The system records log activities that show the origin of transactions. All actors can see the transaction of agricultural products stored in the blockchain ledger in the Blockchain.

As a solution, we propose an efficient and anonymous web3-based voting system that provides incentives. The use of blockchain technology ensures that voting results are stored in a decentralized manner, reducing the possibility of tampering and ensuring vote integrity. To protect voter privacy, our system incorporates stealth addresses to conceal ballot content and lightweight ring signatures to verify voter validity without the risk of double voting. Furthermore, our voting system utilizes smart contracts to encourage voting and self-tallying, resulting in improved transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms several existing e-voting systems, thus providing a robust and secure alternative for governments seeking to improve their voting systems.},

Traditional monitoring has been centralized, with healthcare professionals providing face-to-face care to all patients. This is where blockchain is utilized, where users themselves have data and monitor each other. Mutual monitoring of medical information on the blockchain creates a mutually supportive relationship where users themselves monitor each other. In this demonstration experiment, the system was introduced to six elderly people. This decentralized system in which users themselves monitor each other is called the Web3 type. The Web type is a technology that is expected to break through the current concentration of data in overseas digital industries and leave digital data resources in Japan.

Scalability issues on blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum hinder the execution of micropayments due to high confirmation times and fees. In this paper, we propose a payment system that overcomes these limitations by using a payment gateway that leverages the advantages of the Polygon blockchain network for fast and low-cost transactions. User transaction data is securely managed through the MetaMask digital wallet, allowing for privacy and autonomy. By integrating blockchain technology and digital wallets, the solution seeks to promote broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce. The obtained data highlight the benefits that merchants can obtain as a result.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, crowdfunding has become a popular source for raising funds, especially for startups or projects. Many startups opt for crowdfunding platforms to raise funds by exchanging equity because it is affordable and straightforward. However, concerns related to security, investor abuse, and illegal transactions have emerged, which have led to an investigation of the implications of blockchain technology in crowdfunding. In our proposed system, we integrate the functioning of crowdfunding platforms with the blockchain technology. The system will provide a platform for startup ventures where they can pitch their ideas to potential investors. The investors can invest in the ventures in return of equity. All the process is handled by the smart contracts making it transparent, immutable and secure. This reduces the risk of fraudulent transactions. The main advantage of the system is it uses platform sensitive token that can be exchanged with INR and further converted to ER20 token that can be used to communicate with ethereum blockchain. This eliminates the need of having ethers or any kind of wallet for the investors. We have created a mobile based application using Flutter Framework and deployed the smart contract using truffle. We have created a backend using NodeJs server which utilizes the functions from smart contract by creating the instance for them. We have also used MongoDB cloud atlas as a database along with the Ethereum Blockchain.},

The main objective of this system is to provide immediate access to patient health information while addressing concerns about privacy and security. It is developed on the Ethereum network using programming languages, tools, and technologies such as Ganache, Solidity, and web3.js. The system uses smart contracts to provide security and privacy, and transactions are verified and propagated to the entire decentralized network. The system includes a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) with a centralized privacy system that allows authorized parties to access and secure records quickly. The proposed system aims to achieve several objectives such as allowing users to receive the same data simultaneously, increasing efficiency, building trust, and reducing barriers. It secures data storage by restricting user access and enables the secure transfer of patient medical records. The solution allows for better transparency and ownership of sensitive data, which can be recorded and safeguarded via blockchain technology, therefore assisting the healthcare sector. This paper describes a medical record system and a new protocol that can be used quickly and safely, paving the way for more secure and efficient healthcare systems.

 abstract = {The healthcare industry is not immune to the trend of adopting new IT systems, and this includes hospitals and doctors’ offices. To store a patient’s medical history (including diagnoses and treatments), medical history (including diagnostic pictures), and financial data (including demographics and insurance details), a computerised database known as an “Electronic Health Record” (EHR) is used. Because medical records are typically private and must be shielded from prying eyes, ensuring their secure transfer is a top priority for healthcare systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in the proposed study to ensure the security of all sent medical data, including the Chest X-ray MedPix images. This article describes a blockchain-based solution that patients can use to keep all their data in one secure location. This system was built with the Ganache tool on the Ethereum network, making use of Solidity and web3.js as well as other languages, tools, and approaches. In this study, a systematic method is described wherein blockchain smart contracts are used to record patient information and execute tasks in a distributed environment. After a smart contract has been deployed, all transactional communication occurs within its encrypted confines, protecting both the parties and their personal information. As an added bonus, the validated and broadcasted changes intended by the transaction can be checked. To ensure that government agencies have quick access to protected records, there is a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) that stores the information in an encrypted, decentralised manner. Both patients and physicians can use the wallet to log in. In addition, the system will manage and protect all of the doctor and patient’s information. Things like the following are in scope for the proposed system: Users may now access the same information at the same time because to blockchain’s distributed ledger capabilities, which boosts productivity, establishes trust, and lowers barriers to entry. Setting individual permissions for users allows for safe data storage. In addition, the suggested method enables the safe transmission of patient medical records.},

 abstract = {The frequency of software supply chain attacks has reached unprecedented levels, primarily due to the increasing reliance on huge numbers of software and hardware dependencies, and the inherent vulnerabilities they harbor. Currently, vendors providing these software and hardware components share security advisories to centralized databases or post them on proprietary websites, which security engineers have to search manually to find vulnerabilities relevant for their systems. Furthermore, the security advisories often do not follow a standard machine-readable format, which results in the engineers having to manually analyze the documents. In this paper, SENTINEL, a novel solution for automating dissemination and discovery of security advisories leveraging Web3 technologies, is presented. In particular, the Ethereum blockchain is used by vendors to notify asset owners of novel vulnerabilities in their systems in a reliable and accountable manner. Evaluation tests conducted on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet confirm that our proposal is a functional and functioning solution for securely disseminating and discovering security advisories utilizing a fully decentralized infrastructure.

 abstract = {In the evolution of technology, the Web 3.0 has become the future of the technological world. The web 3.0, which is still evolving, aims in creating an immersive environment which contains smart applications supported by AI and aims in decentralization of data. In the upcoming era, the successor of today’s transactions is most likely to be the transactions through cryptocurrency, which is built on top of the blockchain technology. It is important to make the upcoming technology more reliable, secure, and fast to bring it to real-time use. To overcome the low throughput and high latency of broadcasting in blockchain technology this paper comes up with the pandemic protocol for broadcasting. Communication can be the most important part of any network to work efficiently. It is a communication protocol used for broadcasting which works on the principle of how the pandemic Covid-19 spread. The implementation of this protocol in the blockchain technology to broadcast the transactions can make the technology more efficient and faster. This implementation will be tested for its efficiency and its throughput, analyze its performance, and resolve issues. Overall, this work will help in remove the inadequacies of existing communication protocols thus helping in demonstrating the benefits of this pandemic protocol for communication. The Pandemic Protocol minimizes data redundancy, reducing latency and network congestion, a significant improvement over traditional protocol. In the Web 3.0 era, the Pandemic Protocol’s efficient communication capabilities make it ideal for real-time applications and network scalability. By minimizing redundant data, it bolsters security, reducing the risk of data tampering and strengthening data integrity. Unlike energy-intensive protocols like Proof of Work (PoW), the Pandemic Protocol minimizes resource consumption, making it eco-friendly and cost-effective.},

 abstract = {Among the tokens issued using blockchain, a token that can be identified and unique is called NFT (Non-fungible Token). And an NFT that cannot be transferred is called SBT (Soulbound Token). Since SBT cannot be transferred from an account, it can be used to indicate what the account is. Using SBT in this way reduces the anonymity of blockchain accounts and makes it easier for users to know information about the accounts. Transactions on the blockchain are essentially anonymous. While this brings benefits, it also has drawbacks. In particular, the general public feels uneasy about anonymous transactions, which discourages them from using blockchain. Reducing account anonymity with SBT brings safe and secure transactions to the blockchain. This will remove the anxiety of the general public and lead to mass adoption of blockchain. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted practice with our company's employees as the first effort. First, we prepared a blockchain account for employees who wanted to participate in the practice and issued an SBT to prove that they are employees. And we issued FT (Fungible Token) that is circulated only between accounts that have this SBT. And we have prepared a text chat-based community where only the SBT holders can gather and exchange opinions and information about blockchain. Participants shared their learnings and information about blockchain within this community. FT was actively sent as an acknowledgment for teaching within the community. A post-practice questionnaire suggested that the exchange of FT improved their motivation to learn about blockchain. On the other hand, the participants were more conscious of the UI/UX of sending FT. And they were not aware of the self-sovereignty of blockchain accounts and private keys. It was suggested that excellent UI/UX is important for the mass adoption of Web3 applications. and that only a few users who are interested in technologies may feel the value of self-sovereignty.},

Traffic Officers will ask you to produce them for verification. Carrying these documents physically is a cumbersome task with a high possibility of documents getting lost or in a poor readable form. Remember the authenticity of these vehicle documents are also debatable. With so many flaws in the current system, there is a need for a system competent of reducing the task of carrying these vehicle documents and also guarantees the authenticity and transparency. As per the Motor Vehicles Act in India, it is mandatory that when driving a vehicle, drivers must carry vehicle-related documents such as Registration Certificate Book, Vehicle Pollution under Control (PUC) Certificate, Vehicle Insurance Policy. As a solution, we are proposing a Decentralized Application where drivers can upload and access their vehicle documents details using OCR anywhere, anytime digitally. A Quick Response Code (QR-Code) is used to store URL generated by the vehicle owner by uploading the vehicle documents, which can be later scanned by the Traffic Officer for verification purpose. The application notifies the vehicle owner on expiration of any documents that must be renewed. The application helps in reducing the overhead efforts made by the Traffic officers for vehicle verification. The objective of the system is to digitize all documents, ensure authenticity of documents, eliminate the use of fake documents, manage vehicle documents, reduce the workload and time.},

 abstract = {Domain Name Service (DNS) has become an essential element of the Internet in current era. The traditional DNS extends its authority down to the Top Level Domains (TLDs) and individual names before returning to the Root Server. To avoid the cons related to centralized authority scheme of the traditional DNS, recently many techniques based on the decentralized Internet with support of Blockchain (BC) are emerging. Hence, currently a variety of protocols and mechanisms are focusing on implementation of the Decentralized Naming Services which in turn supports concept of decentralized internet services. These Decentralized Naming Services are totally based on Blockchain architectures and provides various pros like resistance to single point of failure, resistance to censorship and permanent proof of ownership. Blockchain Domain Names act as Digital Identity in Decentralized Internet. Security is major concern in any DNS system and the similar challenges exists in the Blockchain DNS system too. Further, there is a lot of diversity being observed in decentralized internet space as a Domain name in a Blockchain DNS can refer to a website/portal or a wallet or a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) or simply be parked. Also, currently, there is rampant growth in development of decentralized applications with no standards implemented - neither across Blockchains nor regions. Hence, there is a need to detect security exploits carried out using malicious domains in Blockchain DNS system and implement mitigation measures accordingly. In this research work, we study and analyze malicious domain names in decentralized BC system. We explored Ethereum transaction dataset for detecting malicious transactions using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms with good accuracy of 99% and 95% using Decision Tree and 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) respectively. We also applied ML techniques on Ethereum wallet dark list dataset for detection of domain names that were vii used for phishing attacks. We received 96% accuracy after handling data imbalance by Random Forest model. Model predicted nature of domain based on 17 features that were extracted from Ethereum wallet dark list dataset like number of consonants, vowels, digits, symbols and their ratios to length of domain.},

Moreover, innovative technologies introduce a full-immersive metaverse environment for enabling communication between patients and doctors virtually and efficiently. Nevertheless, remote telesurgery operations in the metaverse are susceptible to various security and privacy issues that need to be tackled to secure the patient's confidential health data. Thus, we design an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) for selecting and conducting telesurgery operations based on the doctors' specialization and type of surgery. The proposed application ensures secure and preserved communication between patient and doctor in the metaverse environment by deploying the smart contract in the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). DApp is designed using web3 and JavaScript (JS) to reflect the telesurgery operations to the doctor and patient in the metaverse environment. Finally, the proposed smart contract for the application is evaluated based on parameters such as gas consumption analysis for smart contract functions and doctors registered and cost analysis for smart contract functions.},

One of its key technologies is decentralized identity (DID), which has gained significant attention recently. However, existing DID solutions are not scalable enough to be compatible with the large-scale identity node applications required by Web3 across various fields. To overcome this challenge, we propose the first multi-layer Web3 DID architecture utilizing sharding blockchain, which provides management, scalability, and compatibility. This architecture leverages leader shards and the main chain to establish trust, while regular shards manage DID-related transactions. Specific system processes and query optimizations are also given. Besides, formal security analysis and comprehensive simulation evaluations have demonstrated that the architecture can achieve all proposed security and performance goals, including low latency of down to 2 seconds and high throughput of up to 90KTPS.},

 abstract = {Today, educational data, controlled centrally by educational institutions and administrative units, may be vulnerable to damage caused by natural disasters, political instability, and wars. Simultaneously, challenges arise in accessing this data for educational activities within the framework of exchange programs or lifelong learning. In the literature, there are numerous blockchain-based studies focusing on storing and sharing data in various fields. While several studies exist on blockchain applications for certification, verification, and data sharing in the education sector, a fully decentralized infrastructure has not yet been presented. To address this issue, it is proposed that data control should shift to the hands of students, who are the rightful owners of the data, rather than being solely in the hands of educational institutions. In alignment with the decentralized internet vision, Web3, public blockchain networks are considered the most suitable infrastructure for this purpose. To meet this need, a framework named PublicEduChain has been introduced within the scope of this study. PublicEduChain allows students to store their data in smart contracts created on the public Ethereum network, making it possible to share this information with any educational institution and administrative units. Educational institutions can access student data stored in smart contracts on the public Ethereum network through Learning Management System (LMS) applications and can add data to these contracts. PublicEduChain ensures that data is managed under student ownership within a fully decentralized infrastructure. The practical steps in PublicEduChain, such as creating a smart contract, logging into LMSs with Ethereum IDs, and allowing LMSs to read and write data in the student contract, are explained in detail.},

Influence maximization (IM) has always been a critical technical focus in areas such as viral marketing, network regulation, and opinion monitoring. Currently, a significant amount of existing literature revolves around the optimization of influence maximization problems such as greedy algorithms, heuristic algorithms and classical propagation models. In this paper, we first develop a linear threshold model that is sensitive to the word-of-mouth effect, which appropriately reflects the reputation mechanism of blockchain social networks. Moreover, we have devised an algorithm (CRB) based on community segmentation and community ranking to optimize the operational efficiency of the greedy algorithm. It measures community impact through three attributes: community social score, community density, and community scale. Series experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. Our experimental results reveal the impact of the word-of-mouth effects on decentralized social networks and provide evidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of the CRB algorithm.},

 abstract = {The advent of Web3 technologies and blockchain has opened new avenues for exploring decentralized solutions to pressing environmental issues. A blockchain-based Web3 application for the management of CO2 absorption rights could be a very effective solution to combat climate change. Blockchain technology allows the creation of permanent and transparent records of transactions in a decentralized network, which makes it an ideal tool for monitoring and managing CO2 absorption rights. The rights could be registered in the blockchain and transferred through smart contracts, which would guarantee the validity and traceability of these transactions. In addition, the Web3 application would allow greater accessibility for users, since it could be accessed from anywhere without the need to have proprietary systems installed. Decentralized applications could also be used to verify CO2 emissions and removals by users, which would increase transparency and trust in the system. This paper presents the development of a novel Web3 application that leverages blockchain technology for managing CO2 absorption rights using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The proposed application allows for the secure, transparent, and efficient management of CO2 absorption rights, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of carbon offsetting initiatives.},

To address this problem and open the way for a secure and efficient society, where the privacy of citizens is paramount, the identity concept and proof of identity mechanisms need to be redesigned from the ground up. In this paper we discuss how the emerging Web3 technologies like distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized storage systems, and crypto wallets can be leveraged to design and implement a decentralized digital identity system based on decentralized identifiers (DID) and self-sovereign identities (SSI). Such a system puts the users in full control over their own data while also providing a solid backbone for building interoperable systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient. We propose different architectures for the decentralized identity infrastructure and storage layer, and also discuss the mapping of these architectures on cloud platforms. The main goal is to provide an architectural blueprint for a scalable, secure, privacy-preserving and trusted system.},

The objective is finding a good trade-off between security, privacy and reliability, without loosing scalability potential. To this end, blockchain technology, previously only applied in the context of cryptocurrencies, has been integrated with IoT applications (BIoT) to fulfill all these needs, bringing a decentralized approach and promoting new business logic ideas to the field. Despite the promising benefits of this integration, BIoT has faced scalability concerns, due to the complex task of handling massive data transactions that can be generated in monitoring IoT applications. In order to contribute with an alternative solution to this problem, this paper proposes a completely decentralized architecture designed for Smart Agriculture. It explores the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS), as a name system that can be updated over time; the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), as a Distributed File System (DFS) to store the IoT data; and a multichain network, built with public and private blockchains, delivering a full Web3 approach that can be applied in IoT data marketplace.

Real-time, lowlatency interactions are essential, as is familiarity with the dynamics of distributed apps and blockchain technology. In the second stage, we examine the current MEC setup, from edge server dispersion to data center density to network topology. The technique takes use of the low latency, high throughput, and huge device connection offered by 5G and impending 6G networks to guarantee preparedness for the future. The suggested technique is based on novel building layouts as its foundation. Latency, throughput, resource usage, scalability, and security compliance are only few of the metrics that may be evaluated to guarantee that the design is effective. The difficulties of actual deployment are also discussed; they include issues like where to put edge servers and how to scale resources according to demand. To ensure that the process remains in step with developing technologies and user preferences, it is recommended that improvements be made in a series of iterations.},

Once the theoretical principles and hardware requirements are fully understood, the technique moves on to the design step. Key to realizing these abstract ideas is the development of specialized hardware architectures and components. Based on the outcomes of the performance assessment, iterative refinement is carried out to fix the hardware's flaws and enhance its functionality. As a result of this iterative process, hardware is kept up to date to suit the ever-shifting requirements of Web3.0 and edge intelligence.

 abstract = {The implementation of blockchain-based token transfers has emerged as a transformative tool for innovation and enhanced financial inclusion. To implement Blockchain based token transfers, smart contracts play a pivotal role in automating complex processes, enhancing efficiency, and driving innovation for tokenized assets and decentralized applications (dApps) that can be run on Ethereum. With rising popularity of smart contracts in 2015, necessity for a standardized token approach within the Ethereum ecosystem is recognized. To address interoperability issues and challenges in exchanging tokens between different applications, the Ethereum Request for Commet-20 (ERC20) standard was introduced through the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) process. Since then, several numerous schemes have been proposed efforts to enhance token transfers and implementations while adhering to ERC-20 standards. Despite the substantial progress made in optimizing the functionality and efficiency of token transfers, achieving a truly user-friendly experience has remained an ongoing challenge. To address this challenge, several schemes have been proposed to refine the user interface and experience associated with ERC-20 token transfers. Our research work proposes a practical approach to address concerns by creating a simple user-friendly decentralized web application (Web3) using smart contracts that adhere to ERC-20 standards. By focusing on the development of a seamless user experience, the system developed aims to empower users to send tokens effortlessly by connecting to various wallets available in the market.},

However, drawbacks to these marketplaces include the platform's ability to block merchants at their own whim, the fees paid to the platform when listing a product and when selling a product, and the lack of privacy of users' data. In this paper, we propose an application that remedies all three of these drawbacks through use of the Ethereum blockchain platform. The application was developed using the Truffle development framework. The application's functions were contained within an Ethereum smart contract, which was then migrated to the Ethereum network. The user's input was read through a web interface and sent to the Ethereum network via the web3.js API. Statistics about the application were gathered on the Rinkeby test network. The application was shown to have an average transaction runtime of 3.8 seconds, and an average gas consumption of 4.6 wei. Contract creation times for the application were shown to be less than a second. A cost analysis of the application was then conducted. The gas consumption of the transactions needed to both buy and sell a product was converted into US dollars, and the gas cost of the application was then compared to the cost to use an online auction marketplace such as eBay as well as an in-person auction house such as Sotheby's. The results showed that selling on the application is cheaper than existing online options as well as existing in-person options. These tests showed that our application was successful in addressing the drawbacks of current auction marketplaces.},

We identify key elements comprising the P2P energy trading platform based on blockchain. The software architecture of our energy trading platform is provided with example codes. We build smart contracts on Ethereum for determination of trading price as well as matching between prosumers and consumers in such a way to balance the surpluses and the demands. At the start of each trading period, the prosumers and consumers send their respective amounts of surplus or demand. And the smart contract for price determination automatically evaluates the price in a predetermined way to balance surplus and demand within the neighborhood. Another smart contract performs matching between prosumers and consumers using this price. Authenticated and private messaging called `whisper' is employed for prosumers and DSO(Distributed System Operator)s to notify injection of surplus energy to the DSO and verify the ownership of the injected energy. Each participant interacts with Ethereum virtual machine through web server built with Node.js, Web3.js and Geth.

 abstract = {Modern day entertainment and music streaming has largely been dependent on digital technologies. People prefer subscription based online services to buying physical copies of the music albums. Online streaming services like Spotify, Apple iTunes, Google Music offer great services to the listener with ease. However, drawbacks to these systems includes long delays in payouts for the artists, lack of transparency, confusing payments and licensing terms. In this paper we propose an application that solves all these three drawbacks by making use of Ethereum blockchain and IPFS protocol. The Ethereum blockchain is used for recording transactions and payment management using smart contracts. As storing large files on the Ethereum network costs a lot, the IPFS protocol is used for storing music files, which is a peer to peer protocol. The frontend is built using Web3.js and both listener and artist interact on the blockchain through browser. A PPP(Pay-Per-Play) model with fixed price or as per artist will be defined in the smart contract. The artist can also add other benefactors and share the pay with them. Streaming will be a free service; however, the listeners can tip the artists for supporting. PPP is a smart contract that will be running on the Ethereum blockchain that will be used to set and reward artists with a fixed set of tokens, native currency of platform, per play. Miners will mine new blocks to be added to the blockchain, for which they will be incentivized with tokens. 25 percent of tokens mined per block will go towards a pool for paying artists for streams of their music. The IPFS nodes for storing and distribution of music will be controlled by the artists. Thus, a complete autonomous system for music streaming can be built with least involvement of third parties, and a direct relationship between artist and listener.},

In the e-FIR database, the offense's record can be compromised due to its centralized nature, and further the intentional registration of false e-FIR can occur. Thus, data integrity and transparency are key concerns in e-FIR database. In this paper, e-FIR data integrity and false registration appended with police stations in a centralized database are addressed via a consensus-based distributed blockchain solution, as an integral part of a smart city environment. Specifically, a smart contract based intelligent framework has been utilized to explore the potential of Ethereum blockchain in providing integrity to e-FIR data stored in a police station's database. Local database is interfaced with Ethereum blockchain using Web3 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol. Multiple simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

Normally people think that they are not suffering or affected by the disease because they do not have symptoms. But it does not necessarily mean a person with no symptom has no chronic disease. This paper presents design and prototype implementation of a blockchain system which remotely monitors patient health records. The patient monitoring system is a big challenge and other security threats arises as the health care data transferred from one to another and authorization to create and read transactions, is a major concern related to data loss. The data loss of the patient protected health information which are generated from the devices should be handled carefully. So in this paper we proposed a solidity based smart contract run over a Ethereum virtual machine to facilitate the secure analysis and storing of transactions from and to the sensors. Using the Ethereum protocol, based on a private blockchain and writing the smart contracts to keep track of the patient health information. We have created an automatic system through which the sensors collects the data, then communicates with the decentralized application via the smart contract. The method inside the smart contract collects data when they are called, also reads and writes transactions of all events on the Ethereum virtual network. This solidity based smart contract system along with injected web3, metamask, and truffle environment would support alert transaction to the patient and medical professionals.},

However, few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0. Our definition is not the only way of understanding ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, in this article, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: ${\mathsf (i)}$(i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and ${\mathsf (ii)}$(ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService in approximately 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability and scalability.},

In this paper we make the case for using deep reinforcement learning in Web3 reputation calculation. More specifically, we propose a model which allows for decentralized calculation of scores with high personalization for the user.},

 abstract = {Physical documents have many challenges, due to being difficult to exchange and the potential of being lost and sabotaged. Digital documents seem to address some of these challenges, but because of the use of the Internet and reliance on third parties to share and preserve such documents, the privacy and integrity of the digital documents became difficult to maintain. The blockchain technology that Satoshi Nakamoto has proposed for financial transactions can be used to solve the problems of trust in centralized systems and the subversion and alteration thatthese transactions may be exposed to. Blockchain-based systems have shown their effectiveness and ability to solve most security problems related to exchanging systems' transactions. Hence,A decentralized system for exchanging digital documents, using Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), has been proposed to overcome the problems of using trusted third-parties in exchanging digital documents. The proposed system provides immutable and irreversible logs of the process of sending and receiving documents. In this framework, all registered users can encrypt the documents using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm, send, and receive documents using the Ethereum Blockchain's smart contract. The framework was simulated locally using Ganache Blockchain and tested on the official Ethereum test network Ropsten, and the experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The smart contract used in the Ethereum blockchain was written in the Solidity programming language, and the website that was needed to interact with the blockchain was built using React and other different javascript libraries like web3. Additionally, Metamask wallet was used to create the Ethereum accounts which are required to connect and communicate with the Smart Contract that is implemented in the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, the model's results indicated that the model may cost an average of 0.0552$ per transaction, and this shows that the system is affordable. Also, the model has satisfied the three main security requirements which are confidentiality, integrity, and availability by using the suitable countermeasure for each one of them.},

At the same time, due to globalization and other factors, the use of these social platforms is expanding daily, and a variety of activities take place inside these platforms. These networks are centralized, allowing social network-owned companies to track and observe the activities of their users. Therefore, this has been challenged to the privacy of the data of users. Also, these companies tend to sell them to third parties keeping huge profits without users' permission. Since data is the most valuable asset in today's and tomorrow's world, many have pointed out this issue. Even though decentralized, community-driven applications have come to playas a solution to this problem, there is still no successful application that competes with centralized social network platforms. Therefore, this study attempted to develop a decentralized social network architecture with the basic functionalities of a social media platform to assure the privacy of the users' data.},

They suffer from limitation such as- mandatory fees to be paid to the platform for listing and selling items, lack of privacy and control over account, improper transaction security and so on. This paper presents a decentralized application aiming to reduce these drawbacks using Ethereum blockchain. It was implemented using truffle evolvement framework with solidity language. Ethereum smart contracts contain all functions of this application. Client-side application was created through an API called web3.js. Analytical analyses of this application using Kovan test network show least transactional fees reported in literature till date. The application was shown to have average transaction fee of 0.1524472 (eth) with average run time of 3.5 seconds and average gas consumption of 4.6 gwei, these are the best results obtained till date for such system ensuring cost effectiveness and reducing time complexity. The contract making time was less than a second.

Various structures of Blockchains are designed in fields such as e-health as it can facilitate safe and secure storage of the patient’s information in the health care system. Data integration problem in healthcare can be overcome by bringing a decentralized system in the hospital organization. This paper focuses on the use of Blockchains in managing medical records for insurance claim. By removing the central administrator, the suggested architecture uses Ethereum smart contracts to create a tamperproof and transparent healthcare system and ensure the integrity of sensitive patient data. Additionally, the smart contract keeps the patient well-informed and governs the communication between all the participants in the network. The proposed approach provides a solution to eliminate fraudulent insurance claims using Machine Learning (ML) with Blockchain.

The growing popularity of online shopping has put immense pressure on the supply-chain industry, especially on last-mile delivery. The available solutions suffer from high cost, and lack of transparency. Therefore, assuring traceability of users' actions has become a critical requirement to establish trust between parties. The proposed PackChain framework uses the Ethereum blockchain to offer a crowdsourcing platform for last-mile delivery with autonomous and transparent processes. PackChain provides all the core functions needed for the delivery framework to operate through smart contracts such as managing user information, accepting offers, verifying transactions, and handling payments. In addition, the framework relies on proofs of delivery as an arbitration mechanism between users to release or hold funds. The proposed framework is implemented using Solidity and Web3.js to interact between clients and carriers. The emulation results demonstrate the feasibility and cost-efficiency of the proposed solution11The full code of the smart contract and the related logic is also made publicly available on Github..},

We deliver a sharded blockchain technology with unlimited scalability, called KSI Cash, which is based on a new form of electronic money scheme, the bill scheme. We present performance tests of KSI Cash that we have conducted with the European Central Bank in order to assess the feasibility of a digital euro. We show the system operating with 100 million wallets and 15,000 transactions per second (under simulation of realistic usage); having an estimated carbon footprint of 0.0001g CO2 per transaction. Furthermore, we show the system operating with up to 2 million payment orders per second, an equivalent of more than 300,000 transactions per second (in a laboratory setting with the central components of KSI Cash), scaling linearly in the number of shards. We explain, in detail, the key concepts that unlock this performance (i.e., the concepts of the bill money scheme). The results provide evidence that the scalability of our technology is unlimited in both permissioned and permissionless scenarios, resulting into the Alphabill Money technology. Next, we contribute the architecture of a universal tokenization platform that allows for universal asset tokenization, transfer and exchange as a global medium of exchange, called Alphabill platform.

In this paper, we present the results from a systematic mapping study to give structure to the information found from primary sources. Systematic mapping is a well-known method to identify and categorize research papers in a field with an increasing amount of literature. For this systematic mapping, we searched for studies between 2017 and present-day (March 2022) and were able to find 303 results, from which 47 were selected, by specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, to be relevant to this study. A concept map was created from the information gathered from primary sources to the attributes such as research type, contribution type, blockchain network, smart contract language, development process, testing methods, and testing environment. We also categorized the trends and demographics found in the selected papers based on publication year, author’s country, and more. The results of this systematic mapping showed that this field is very new and quickly increasing with new research.

 abstract = {With the continuous development of web technology, Web3.0 has attracted a considerable amount of attention due to its unique decentralized characteristics. The digital economy is an important driver of high-quality economic development and is currently in a rapid development stage. In the digital economy scenario, the centralized nature of the Internet and other characteristics usually bring about security issues such as infringement and privacy leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate how to use Web3.0 technologies to solve the pain points encountered in the development of the digital economy by fully exploring the critical technologies of digital economy and Web3.0. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of Web3.0 that should be integrated with the digital economy to better find the entry point to solve the problems by examining the latest advances of Web3.0 in machine learning, finance, and data management. We hope this research will inspire those who are involved in both academia and industry, and finally help to build a favourable ecology for the digital economy.},

The introduction of blockchain technology prompted a new generation of social media based on the concept of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and other Web3 technologies, giving birth to the Metaverse. Decentraland is one such platform, where users can explore a 3D virtual world and communicate with each other. The main feature of Decentraland is that the virtual world is divided into parcels, implemented through NFTs, that can be traded among users and where owners can create buildings or mini-games for other users to play with. In this work, we explore the virtual world of Decentraland by presenting the main details of the virtual world and by focusing on the economic impact of NFT trading on the description of the parcels. In detail, the parcel's description can be used to advertise the proximity of the parcel to infrastructures or special projects to attract potential buyers. This paper's findings show the impact and the magnitude of this phenomenon, highlighting entire quarters that adopt this technique throughout the map by overriding the playful aspect of the platform.},

Nowadays, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) are used to poll which may be tampered resulting in incorrect election results. Therefore, an online voting system has been introduced in this research. An Electronic Voting (E-Voting) machine is a balloting machine wherein the election opinions are notated, saved, stored, and processed digitally, which makes the balloting control project complicated than the conventional paper based method. The Election Commission forms elections and enlist party candidates along with the parties for contesting the election. This paper works with the following ideas by having the two different sets of modules: election commission and the voters. An election’s REST API is arranged on Ethereum’s Blockchain, which is the front end. The votes are then stored on the blockchain architecture, to which the Election Commission grants the number of votes. However, there are some limitations due to the fact that the blockchain architecture cannot run on the main net as it must be hosted, and a separate web3 provider must be used for interacting with it due to the lack of public API availability.},

Paper-based profiles and defacement are vulnerable to spoofing, loss, and theft. Digital platforms with efficient IMS boost administrative processes and bring transparency and interoperability among establishments. The traditional paper-based identity systems are slow and rigid. Conventional centralized IMS lack transparency and are vulnerable to single-point failure. This paper presents a blockchain-aware decentralized identity management and access control (BADIMAC) model that mitigates these barriers. BADIMAC allows users to keep their digital identity within their control (i.e., self-sovereign identity). On the other hand, with the help of BADIMAC, service providers across enterprise boundaries can verify their identity without depending on any central authority. BADIMAC offers transparency and better security. The decentralized consensus-based design of BADIMAC enables the verifier to validate claims and establish proof of digital identity with process effectiveness.},

As a result, the current model suffers from good governance. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information.

 abstract = {The rapid growth of modern technologies has encouraged non-profit organizations (NPOs) to harness such technologies to better serve the charity sector, especially in relation to charity donation processes. Non-profit organizations primarily rely on fundraising that may involve opaque operations, which leads to the exacerbation of fears that donations may be used for illegal purposes or not reach deserving people. The necessity of charity donations traceability system is inevitable to overcome such concerns, which have an adverse impact on doners’ trust in the donation process. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based donation traceability framework intended to enable all involved parties to trace the progress of charity donations from the moment they are given by donors to the moment they reach the intended recipients. The system is built on a public-permissioned blockchain on the Ethereum platform, with every transaction being recorded as a block in the chain. These blocks of information are immutable and visible to all parties, and they also enable timely and traceable transactions. The proposed framework’s effectiveness is evaluated using a hybrid qualitative approach and proves to improve the traceability of charity donations overcoming the uncertainty associated with current systems.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the network of medical devices, software applications, and healthcare information systems used for remote monitoring and delivery of healthcare services. Despite the several advantages of IoMT for today smart healthcare, security issues are growing due to the inadequate computation, limited storage and insufficient self-protection capabilities of IoMT devices. Authentication of IoMT devices is the main requirement to secure IoMT systems. Although, the recent authentication schemes based on tamper-proof decentralized architecture of blockchain technology are robust and enjoy a high level of security, yet they require high computation, more storage, and long authentication time. These issues lead to reduced scalability and time efficiency, which are necessary for large-scale, time-sensitive IoMT systems. To this end, this paper proposes a novel group authentication framework for IoMT Systems. The group authentication scheme is implemented through a four-phase process, including setup, registration, secret construction, and authentication. To enhance both efficiency and scalability, the proposed group authentication framework employs a combination of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) algorithm, and blockchain-based fog computing technologies. We simulated the proposed framework through the Ethereum platform and Solidity language and its performance is evaluated using the Hyperledger Caliper tool. The simulation experiments of the proposed framework showed that the average latency of authenticating IoMT devices was 0.5 second and the throughput was 400 transactions per second. Our analysis of the proposed framework’s performance against other cutting-edge blockchain-based authentication techniques showed that it outperformed them in terms of latency and throughput. A security analysis of the proposed framework was conducted using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The formal and informal security analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework is secure and resistant to potential authentication-related attacks. We also noted that the average latency of the proposed framework maintains a fairly narrow range when the number of submitted transactions rises, indicating that it supports the scalability of the IoMT system.},

 abstract = {Voting is a fundamental democratic activity. Many experts believe that paper balloting is the only appropriate method to ensure everyone’s right to vote. But this method is prone to errors and abuse. Many nations utilize digital voting methods to solve the difficulties of paper balloting. A single flaw in digital voting may lead to massive vote-rigging. Election voting methods must be legal, accurate, safe, and convenient. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict acceptance. Due to its end-to-end verification capabilities, blockchain technology was developed to address these problems. To guarantee We have used blockchain technology anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting. By using blockchain our proposed system ensures security, privacy, and integrity. This system provides voter anonymity by keeping the voter information as a hash in the blockchain. It also provides fairness by keeping the casted vote encrypted till the ending time of the election. After ending time, the voter can verify their casted vote, ensuring verifiability. To test our protocol, we put it on Ethereum 2.0, a blockchain platform that uses Solidity as a programming language to create smart contracts. The adoption of smart contracts provides a safe means for performing voter verification, ensuring the correctness of voting results, making the counting system public, and protecting against fraudulent activities. We analyzed the system’s performance based on security and gas costs. It improves in terms of security characteristics and the related cost for the necessary infrastructure.},

 abstract = {The utilization of blockchain technology in the fishing industry has been extensively studied and implemented to address issues such as illegal fishing and carbon emissions control. However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain. While solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria. Despite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.},

The need for a comprehensive study addressing BC bloat solutions arises due to the scarcity of knowledge in this emerging area. This study advances knowledge along with practical insights and inspires innovative approaches to address BC bloat. This research explores various techniques proposed to combat BC bloat. Two technique themes are identified: on-chain and off-chain techniques. On-chain techniques focus on updating the consensus mechanism, block size, or database partition. This study identified five on-chain techniques: structural modification, pruning, sharding, ephemeral BC, and zk-SNARKs. Off-chain techniques focus on processing in parallel, bundling transactions, or handling transactions off-chain. Further, three off-chain techniques identified are off-chain storage, historical data storage, and light clients’ techniques. These recommendations aim to optimize resources use, enhance scalability, and maintain data integrity. However, these may compromise several BC capabilities, such as security, privacy, and data loss. The applicability of these techniques for resource-constrained devices is also explored. Future research should include further investigation into the performance and applicability of these techniques, especially in resource-constrained environments like IoT and fog computing.},

There is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that integrates Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, and advanced cryptographic techniques to address these challenges and enhance the security and transparency of transactions. This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction.

Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain.

In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.},

 abstract = {Blockchains have been around for more than ten years, and since 2015, a plethora of systems have been launched to target more flexible use cases. More recently, several enterprise blockchain systems, such as Consensys Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric, have been launched to make blockchain simpler to apply in complex organizational configurations. In this paper, we identify a specific Department of Defense use case, extrapolate requirements, and perform a thorough assessment of the different layers of the blockchain stack to identify the existing state of the art and undertake a gap analysis of the technology for this context. We describe a platform that meets many of these challenges and show how we architected, designed, and implemented a solution for this use case for deployment at NAVAIR. This solution connects transactions from two separate blockchain systems, Consensys Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric, by using a graph-based approach that preserves privacy while enabling full transparency across the military and supplier networks.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.},

 abstract = {The emergence of the Web3 paradigm has led to more and more systems built on blockchain technology and relying on cryptocurrency tokens – both fungible and non-fungible – to sustain themselves and generate profit. The growth and success of these platforms are strongly dependent on the growth and evolution of the trade relationships among users. In this context, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanism behind the evolution and growth dynamics of these economic ties: however, in these systems the trade relationships are strictly intertwined with social dynamics, posing significant challenges in the analysis. One of the most important mechanisms behind the evolution of social networks is the triadic closure principle: given the strict link between social and economic spheres, the mechanism emerges as a potential candidate among mechanisms in literature. Therefore in this work, we extend the existing methodology for triadic closure studies and adapt it to directed networks. We performed an analysis centered around 3-node subgraphs known as “triads” and statistically significant triads referred to as “triadic motifs”, both from a static and temporal perspective. The methodology was applied to various decentralized socio-economic networks with distinct levels of social components. These networks include currency transfers from the blockchain-based online social media platform Steemit, trade relationships among NFT sellers and buyers on the Ethereum blockchain, and a blockchain-based currency designed for humanitarian aid called Sarafu. Our measurements show how triadic closure is relevant during the evolution of these platforms and, for a few aspects, more impactful than centralized online social networks, where triadic closure is also incentivized by recommendation systems. Moreover, we are able to highlight both similarities and differences across networks with different levels of social components, both from a static and temporal standpoint. Overall our work presents strong evidence that triadic closure is an important evolutionary mechanism in decentralized socio-economic networks. Our findings provide a stepping stone in the study of decentralized socio-economic networks. Understanding the evolution of other decentralized networks, not following the same Web3 paradigm or with different social components will provide valuable insight into the understanding of dynamics in decentralized systems and potentially improve their design process.},

 abstract = {The effort to reach the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations has incentivized the adoption of IT solutions in many fields. Many systems for sustainable economic development are now relying on a digital form making them more accessible and provides the access to new functionalities. A very interesting example of such systems are complementary currencies i.e. cooperative currency systems that support national economies to provide humanitarian aid and promote sustainable development. While there are many studies on the principles and case studies of successful complementary currencies, many aspects are still unexplored, especially regarding cooperative behavior. Cooperative behavior in these systems is a key aspect, as complementary currencies are often born out of cooperation among members that face a period of crisis or they usually have the objective of creating bonds of reciprocity and integrating social networks between people, which should lead to increased cooperation. However, there is a lack of studies on many aspects of cooperative behavior in complementary currencies, such as how such behavior changes over time, especially in times of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover how cooperation behavior is affected by time and different geographical locations is still unclear. In this work, we analyze Sarafu, a complementary currency that went digital and now relies on blockchain technology. Sarafu is a successful case of a complementary currency that was used for humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, Sarafu is a perfect case study for the study of cooperative behavior, as it implements a special type of account, the group account, to support cooperation groups. This feature supports the study of group dynamics and behavior. What we find is that Sarafu users exhibit strong reliance on cooperation groups; we also observe that the interaction of users and cooperation groups is influenced by both time and geographical location. The study of group accounts and in general mechanisms that promote cooperation can be useful for other humanitarian or community development projects. Moreover, similar cooperation enhancers could have an important role in other social development projects, and in general, in any setting where there is a strong need to foster cooperation for reaching social good.},

 abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.},

These innovations offer creative solutions to address longstanding challenges. However, the novelty of these concepts has given rise to issues related to information asymmetry among investors, exacerbated by the opinions shared on social media platforms. To comprehensively analyse the trends of these technologies and their societal impact, as well as their influence on the contemporary business landscape, we conducted a study in the social platforms X (formerly known as Twitter) analysing 59,453 tweets using natural language processing (NLP). Through this research, we have identified key topics such as investment security or corporate challenges that provide valuable insights and structured information essential for industry stakeholders. In summary, this study explores the dynamic interplay between blockchain technology, ICOs, STOs and social media in the industry. It sheds light on the sentiment and implications of the use of this technology and these emerging financial models, offering a nuanced understanding of their impact on the market. Thus, the idea that user opinions play a crucial role in influencing decisions is supported, and their impact can fluctuate depending on the changing dynamics of the market.},

Developing smart contract methods is more difficult than mainstream software development as the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. We report on a new approach to developing smart contracts with the objective of automating the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce the risk of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into the processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages.

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization.

The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.},

The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified — one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon. This is to promote transparency and verifiability within and among government processes.},

 abstract = {The management of construction projects requires adequate techniques to support the continual exchange of information across disciplines. Recent advances in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have exposed new ways for process and data integration with open data formats, process mapping, and terminology. In construction projects where multiple disciplines produce and share BIM data, mechanisms for defining information priority, provenance and suitability become necessary in order to have consistent and traceable use of data. This includes objects or collection of attributes for data objects that are associated with a discipline or organisation including clear identification of the transaction that has introduced the information. Blockchain can be used to record metadata of BIM objects such as the issuing discipline, object version and responsibility/ liability associated with the data. Blockchain can offer the capability to apply levels of “trust” to individual BIM objects and a more secured framework of collaboration across stakeholders. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based BIM data provenance model to support information exchange in construction projects. By testing the solution in a real-world bridge construction scenario, it has been shown that the approach can recognise the levels of competence and can improve the process of BIM implementation.

 abstract = {Blockchains and smart contracts are gaining momentum as enabling technologies for a wide set of applications where data distribution and sharing among decentralized infrastructures is required. In this work, we present a distributed application developed using blockchain technologies that allows individuals and health insurance organizations to come into agreement during the implementation of the healthcare insurance policies in each contract. For this purpose, health standards and semantic web technologies were used for the formal expression of both the insured individual's data and contract terms. Accordingly, a fine-grained data access policy was applied for evaluating contract terms on the basis of relevant data captured in healthcare settings. A prototype was implemented involving the development of several different smart contracts for the Ethereum platform as well as the necessary visual environment for accessing them. The developed system validates various features related to blockchain and smart contract features that are briefly discussed in this work, part of which can be mitigated or resolved through the use of a private permissioned blockchain. The application of well-established techniques for potential malfunctions of external services could also boost the security of the system and prevent it from potential attacks.},

In this research, the different techniques used in existing blockchain-based educational systems have been reviewed and in the end, a novel web-based digital badge and microcredentials system which helps the learners to acquire the desired skills is proposed. For the Blockchain, Ethereum has been used and to develop the front end ReactJS has been used. A digital badging and micro-credential system consisting of quizzes and digital badges was built with Ethereum blockchain together with ipfs to store the badge image and firebase for examination, registration, and storing courses. The proposed system proved to be very much beneficial and addressed the inherent limitations of traditional learning content management systems (LCMS).},

 abstract = {New digital technologies generate large amounts of information. This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services and products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing personal data may result in the extraction of sensitive information, which, in turn, may lead to jeopardizing the users’ privacy. To mitigate this significant risk, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union elaborated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation forces Service Providers to obtain Data Subjects’ explicit consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. Nevertheless, the GDPR’s legislative text does not define how Service Providers must transparently demonstrate that they already have these consents. Moreover, most individuals do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither does this regulation provide them with efficient methods to be aware of what third parties are doing with such data. In order to address this situation, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. The new solution provides public access to immutable evidences that reflect the reached agreements between Data Subjects and Service Providers. In this way, Service Providers can effectively demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are able to control and manage their personal data according to their legitimate rights. We have implemented the new system, and we have performed a detailed study which includes: GDPR-compliance, provided functionality, security and privacy issues, and the cost in terms of gas and US dollars of the different operations to be run on the blockchain.},

 abstract = {The popularity of blockchain technology has bootstrapped many “Web3” applications, e.g., Ethereum and IPFS, that apply distributed ledger technology to store transactions. The amount of transactions generated and stored in such Web3 applications is significant and, in its raw form, usually not searchable by users. Existing Web3 transaction indexing and search engines are predominantly centralized and, therefore, can manipulate search results or censor particular queries. With the proliferation of Web3 transactions and applications, a decentralized and censorship-resistant search primitive is becoming essential. We present DeScan, a decentralized and censorship-resistant indexing and search engine for Web3. Users index their local Web3 transactions using custom rules that output triplets. Generated triplets are bundled in a distributed transaction graph that is searchable by other users. To coordinate search and distribute the storage of the transaction graph over peers in the network, we build upon a Skip Graph (SG) data structure. Since the Skip Graph does not provide any resilience against adversarial peers that censor searches, we propose four modifications to improve its robustness. We implement DeScan and conduct experiments with up to 12 800 peers and 10 million Ethereum transactions. Our experiments show that DeScan with our modifications enabled can tolerate 20% adversarial peers and 35% unresponsive peers without disruption. Moreover, we find that searches in DeScan are usually completed well within a second, even when the network grows. Finally, we show that storage and network costs are evenly distributed amongst peers as the network grows.},

Blockchain technology is being used in many applications majorly in cryptocurrencies and bitcoin applications. Verified transactions which make a block and group of such transactions or blocks are immutable making the blockchain more secured and reliable. Blockchain achieves decentralization of power, trust, and secured of being hacked, which solves major problems or issues with the current systems. Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain platform because of its unlimited block size. Many complex problems with smart contracts can be implemented with Ethereum and the eradication of third party organizations interfering in transactions helps solving the issues of financial crisis and it is easy to implement compared to other blockchain technologies. There are certain limitations/issues in processing large number of transactions due to lack of speed in processing the transactions. Ethereum Blockchain code will be executed by different clients with varying speed and the performance level will be different. The goal of this paper is to understand Ethereum transactions and perform the comparative analysis of Geth and Parity ethereum clients on the private blockchain. In this paper, a private blockchain network is setup where the nodes will share the data among peer nodes or blocks within the network. Using this network setup a democracy voting application is developed which makes use of the blockchain to store and process the data, smart contracts are deployed to execute the transactions. Performance analysis of the two most popular ethereum clients Geth and Parity is carried out considering time, consistency and scalability parameters. Results interpret that the overall transactions are 91% on average faster in parity client as compared to Geth client.},

This has driven innovation towards the affirmation of decentralized systems, in line with the Self Sovereign Identity paradigm. User control over the consumption and disclosure of their data is a key topic of such drive. In this paper we show how it is possible to apply this increasingly popular concept to a traditionally centralized and opaque digital process: Access Control systems. To this aim we expand the XACML standard for Attribute Based Access Control systems with the novel concept of private attributes, i.e. attributes whose values should not be disclosed while still contributing to a policy evaluation result after user consent. Basing our proposal on blockchain systems, we show how to leverage smart contracts and zero knowledge proofs to allow for transparent policies evaluation without disclosing the value of such sensible attributes. Beside formalizing our goals, presenting the system architecture, and discussing its advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional model, we provide a reference example to show our proposal innovative capabilities and provide a prototype experimental evaluation to prove its feasibility.},

 abstract = {In the context of extreme societal polarization, activists have mobilized to protest injustices and claim their rights, yet such efforts often fall short of goals because demands normally are directed to government or firms that offer superficial responses. Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.},

In digital payments, the possibility of online fraud or theft of customer data is a problem that needs to be solved. Although the solution is to use a Payment Gateway with security standards to prevent these problems, the system is still centralized and vulnerable to the possibility of system failure or data changes by irresponsible people. Blockchain furnishes a secure and unalterable record for documenting payment transactions. Conversely, IPFS presents a decentralized and immune-to-censorship approach for storing and accessing data. The usage of these technologies guarantees the secure storage of payment transaction data and related documents (such as invoices and receipts) while effectively thwarting data manipulation or censorship attempts. Therefore, this research aims to build a blockchain technology system to increase security and maintain the integrity of the data generated from the Payment Gateway. This research using distributed data storage using IPFS to save transaction from the payment gateway data. Based on the evaluation and security analysis results, implementing a blockchain technology system to store transaction records from digital-based payment gateways can improve data security and integrity. In the gas fee increase analysis, the gas fee will increase according to the total number of bytes generated when the transaction is made, where each byte will cost 12 gwei to pay the gas fee.},

 abstract = {The rise in the cost of essentials affects every nation around the world, but it has become a major concern for developing nations. It is getting increasingly difficult to keep up with rising prices for everyday items in these countries, where the majority of the population is from the middle class or lower middle class. Inflation, pandemics, wars, and other important variables all contribute to price increases. There may be another significant factor at play, which is supply-chain corruption. The supply chain's unreliable, chaotic, and opaque nature is to blame for this corruption. We are concentrating on the agri-food supply chain in our study. Because many of the current agri-food supply chains are intricate and challenging to monitor, dishonest parties can exploit the situation. Therefore, we suggested a thorough blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to identify the source of price increases. The private Ethereum blockchain was used in the suggested system. Since the private Ethereum blockchain is more efficient, safe, and fast, it was chosen. Smart contracts were created to describe the system and its underlying rules and laws. Furthermore, in order to showcase the usefulness of our smart contracts, we exhibited a sample decentralized application to support our hypothesis. We also gave the system a complete security and vulnerability assessment to make sure it is operating properly and is protected from threats and attacks. Due to the use of blockchain, the system is immutable, transparent, and simple to track and monitor. The proposed system has demonstrated greater transparency, traceability, reliability, speed, security, and cost-efficiency compared to conventional systems. It effectively traces the origin of corruption in the supply chain, providing a more straightforward means to tackle concerns related to price hikes.},

In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker’s revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.},

 abstract = {This research paper provides a cross-institutional analysis of design trends, enablers, and challenges in blockchain-enabled cash and voucher delivery in humanitarian programs. The study examines six pilot projects led by three prominent international NGOs across four countries to identify obstacles to innovation, adoption, and scalability that may arise in this context. The research applies human-centered design theory, combined with the multiple case study method, to generate a cross-case synthesis, revealing common threads, specific trends, key reflections, angles of analysis, and design approaches that can facilitate this work in the future. The findings and conclusions from this study aim to be useful and relevant to practitioners, private sector actors, and researchers. The research aims to address existing research gaps and promote a more informed, coordinated, responsible, and rigorous research agenda and community of practice for the use of blockchain applications in the humanitarian sector. Throughout the discussion, this study highlights the frictions related to variables such as context, agency, and participation. A framework for analysis, focused on four key variables: process, people, program and product, is proposed to provide a basis for comparative analysis, and eventually, a series of propositions for interested stakeholders. The study concludes that blockchain technology has the potential to address cost and time inefficiencies in cash and voucher assistance, but success of implementation is highly dependent on design, context, and stakeholder engagement. The paper recommends continued research in this area to further validate findings and expand the use of blockchain technology in humanitarian and development programs. It also emphasizes the significance of integrating these variables into novel approaches to uphold ethical and professional standards in humanitarian work.},

Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.},

In this study, we conducted an empirical study to investigate the categories of Web3 applications and their popularity, as well as the potential challenges and opportunities within this emerging landscape. Our research was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, we analyzed 200 popular Web3 projects associated with 10 leading Web3 venture capital firms. In the second phase, we collected and examined code-related data from GitHub and market-related data from blockchain browsers (e.g., Etherscan) for these projects. Our analysis revealed that the Web3 ecosystem can be categorized into two groups, i.e., Web3 infrastructure and Web3 applications, with each consisting of several subcategories or subdomains. We also gained insights into the popularity of these Web3 projects at both the code and market levels and pointed out the challenges in the Web3 ecosystem at the system, developer, and user levels, as well as the opportunities it presents. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Web3 for researchers and developers, which in turn promotes further exploration and advancement in this innovative field.},

DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.},

The blockchain ensures transparency and trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards through smart contracts.

Continuous authentication was introducing to be superior to traditional authentication schemes by constantly verify users’ identities on an ongoing basis and spot the moment at which an illicit attacker seizes control of the session. However, several challenges remain unsolved. This research aims to investigate the power of Blockchain technology to provide real-time and non-intrusive continuous authentication for the IoT environment. Accordingly, a distributed and scalable continuous authentication solution based on Blockchain technology called CAB-IoT was proposed. It enabled fog nodes layer that tackles the limitations of IoT resources by providing localized processing of heavy continuous authentication-related tasks for a group of IoT devices. Besides, CAB-IoT introduced a trust module that depends on the face recognition machine learning model to detect outliers and abnormal access. Moreover, mutual authentication between end-users and fog nodes is also designed, as well as secure communication between the authenticated nodes. The results demonstrate a lightweight continuous authentication solution that achieved the desired balance between security and performance requirements where it was observed in a real-world environment for truly performance results.

 abstract = {Electronic auctions (e-auctions) remove the physical limitations of traditional auctions and bring this mechanism to the general public. However, most e-auction schemes involve a trusted auctioneer, which is not always credible in practice. Some studies have applied cryptography tools to solve this problem by distributing trust, but they ignore the existence of collusion. In this paper, a blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving and Collusion-Resistant scheme (PPCR) for double auctions is proposed by employing both cryptography and blockchain technology, which is the first decentralized and collusion-resistant double auction scheme that guarantees bidder anonymity and bid privacy. A two-server-based auction framework is designed to support off-chain allocation with privacy preservation and on-chain dispute resolution for collusion resistance. A Dispute Resolution agreement (DR) is provided to the auctioneer to prove that they have conducted the auction correctly and the result is fair and correct. In addition, a Concise Dispute Resolution protocol (CDR) is designed to handle situations where the number of accused winners is small, significantly reducing the computation cost of dispute resolution. Extensive experimental results confirm that PPCR can indeed achieve efficient collusion resistance and verifiability of auction results with low on-chain and off-chain computational overhead.},

The humanitarian sector has emerged as a powerful mechanism of legitimation for blockchain technology. Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.},

The information on critical attributes of carbon footprint, workers' age, and material flow during the entire value chain is captured to provide authentic output of carbon footprint and labour age during any of the value chain activity. The uniqueness of the current work lies in offering a series of immutable transactions using blockchain technology to comprehend the circularity of 3D printing material and account for the overall carbon footprint produced by a 3D printed product considering its whole value chain. This would improve the traceability and visibility of the material supply chain for 3D printing.

 abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with traditional healthcare systems has improved quality of healthcare services. However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as “BDSDT” is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99% using both datasets.},

 abstract = {In recent years, COVID-19 has impacted millions of individuals worldwide, resulting in numerous fatalities across several countries. While RT-PCR technology remains the most reliable method for detecting COVID-19, this approach is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, researchers have explored various machine learning and deep learning-based approaches to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases using X-ray images. Machine learning based models can reduce costs and have shorter processing times. However, preserving patient confidentiality poses challenges within such third-party-controlled systems, potentially failing to safeguard patients from potential disgrace and discomfort. Nonetheless, blockchain technology offers the potential to securely store sensitive medical data anonymously, without requiring third-party intervention. Consequently, the combination of deep learning and blockchain might offer a viable solution to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring patient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model of blockchain and deep learning model for automatically detecting COVID-19 using chest X-rays (CXR). The deep learning model includes a stacking ensemble of three modified pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models: VGG16, Xception, and DenseNet169. The model obtained an accuracy of 99.10% and 98.60% for binary and multi-class respectively.

 abstract = {To abate global carbon emissions, there has been an unprecedented push for carbon transparency in the manufacturing industry. However, with products becoming increasingly complex, they contain sub-assemblies with components that have sub-components supplied by different manufacturers. This creates a multi-tier supply chain that complicates the propagation of sustainability information necessary to compute the product's carbon emission due to the lack of oversight and potential loss of information from manufacturers in the multi-tier supply chain. Blockchain technology, characterized by its immutability, visibility, and traceability, is a promising medium to propagate sustainability information. Despite the fact that many papers have proposed a system that is viable for products with a multi-tier supply chain in the literature, we have not seen its proof-of-concept yet. This work first proposes a blockchain-enabled system that enables the propagation of environmental sustainability information in a multi-tier supply chain. This paper describes the architecture of the proposed blockchain system and the data structure of each block in the blockchain. Based on the defined architecture, we implemented the proposed blockchain system with Ethereum and tested it using the pseudo-multi-tier supply chain of a torchlight.},

 abstract = {Real-time and vision-based quality control for industrial processes has drawn great interest from both scientists and practitioners, particularly following the transition to Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) and Industry 4.0. Despite considerable progress, most ZDM approaches focus on the accuracy of the inspection process, often neglecting critical factors for application in the shop floor. On one hand, near real-time methods are needed for early defect detection and containment. On the other hand, data scarcity is an issue causing AI methods to overfit. Another concern is the accountability of AI results, since even if an AI pipeline is successfully deployed, its predictions are not verifiable in the long term. In this work, we explore a real-time solution based on lightweight Deep Residual Networks and Blockchain technology to address these issues. Concretely, we propose a two-phase training strategy to boost the performance of baseline classifiers while maintaining low inference times. The performance of the proposed methodology is presented in two different industrial use cases with strict timing requirements, one concerning battery assembly line and the other antenna manufacturing. We validate the proposed method for defect detection and compare the results with common training strategies demonstrating an improvement of 3% and 10% in F1-score and accuracy on the two cases respectively, while lowering inference time by 2.2× compared to existing light architectures. Contributing to the accountability of AI results, we present an IoT framework using Blockchain deployed in Private Ethereum.},

While cloud storage brings convenience to the users, it has the disadvantages of low scalability and weak reliability. Blockchain-based distributed storage eliminates data loss due to the tamper-resistant characteristic. Nonetheless, blockchain storage raises some confidentiality and retrieval efficiency issues of data. Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) is an effective search scheme based on ciphertexts, which ensures data security. However, with the increase of data on the blockchain, the data retrieval on the blockchain will be difficult. In this paper, a Complete Binary Tree Searchable Symmetric Encryption using Blockchain (KCB-BC-SSE) scheme is proposed. According to the number of searchers, the scheme is divided into single searcher and multiple searchers where the search efficiency is improved in theory. And the simulation on ethereum shows the feasibility of our scheme. The security analysis illustrates our scheme achieves security under the chosen keyword attack.},

 abstract = {Traditional centralized token exchange (CEX) has been suffering from hacking due to the centralized management of users’ tokens. In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) maintains users’ assets by smart contracts in a decentralized manner, but introduces additional overhead in terms of gas fee and transaction confirmation latency. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the benefits of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is criticized for two issues. First, trading transactions are time-consuming and expensive for frequent token traders. Second, excessive simultaneous transactions might cause the pending transaction congestion in the Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate the pending transaction congestion. Besides, we propose the very first gas-price vs. transaction-confirmation-latency function to guide Ethereum transaction issuers to choose an optimal gas price that minimizes the overall cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the cost in the proposed HEX with that in the conventional HEX. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing gas fees and transaction confirmation latency for frequent traders as well as the pending transaction congestion in Ethereum.},

Our aim is to leverage blockchain technology to mitigate the existing security-related issues concerning the sharing of students’ credentials. Thus, the paper proposes a tamper-proof, immutable, authentic, non-repudiable, privacy protected and easy to share blockchain-based architecture for secured sharing of students’ credentials. To increase the scalability, the proposed system uses a secure off-chain storage mechanism. The performance and viability of the proposed architecture is analyzed by using an Ethereum based prototypical implementation.

The results revealed that user empowerment was the most significant factor influencing acceptance. Furthermore, multigroup analysis (MGA) demonstrates how different contexts have distinct acceptance predictors. Depending on the context, perceived lower fees, perceived faster settlement, perceived income distribution, perceived fraudproof, and perceived traceability had varying significance. Meanwhile, perceived immutability, perceived process automation, and perceived transparency, even though considered appealing, were not significant in influencing acceptance. The findings imply that stakeholders should balance technicality and behavioural aspects, and be aware of the context.},

 abstract = {Crowdfunding is a fundraising method that involves raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically through online platforms. It allows individuals, businesses, or organizations to present their projects, ideas, or causes to a global audience and request financial support from a crowd of potential backers. Crowdfunding has gained popularity across various industries, including technology, arts, entrepreneurship, social causes, and more. It provides a democratized approach to financing, allowing innovative and creative ideas to come to life with the support of a diverse community of backers. The current research explores the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts to revolutionize traditional crowdfunding methodologies. Traditional crowdfunding has been plagued by issues such as lack of transparency, centralized intermediaries, slow payment processing, fraud, and limited access. In response to these challenges, blockchain solutions offer a transparent and decentralized approach, allowing contributors to track their contributions, eliminate intermediaries, automate fund disbursement, and enable cross-border transactions. Tokenization and reduced entry barriers further enhance accessibility and participation. The current research presents a conceptual model and implementation of a smart contract-based crowdfunding system using Solidity, addressing these issues and providing a foundation for future research in the field of decentralized crowdfunding. The research scope has been expanded to encompass Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a means of fundraising for startups. Within this context, fungible tokens, which adhere to the ERC-20 standard, are generated using the OpenZeppelin library. These tokens are then subject to approval by the startup, granting authorization to a crowdfunding manager for the purpose of distributing tokens to contributors based on their respective contributions. The percentage of tokens made available for distribution can be customized to suit the specific needs and preferences of the startup.},

 abstract = {With the rapid growth of big data, the applications of intellectual property (IP) rights and prior art documents are increasing rapidly. Patent examiners are usually overworked to evaluate inventions referring to a large volume of prior arts in a short period. Such increasing workloads and documents may cause administrative inefficiencies and generate low-quality IPs that hamper technological innovation. Moreover, today's centralized IP administration system is inefficient in processing speed, security, and cost. Inefficiencies of IP administration in each national IP office impede speedy and efficient cooperation for international application and registration. This study proposes an IP decentralized ledger (IP dLedger) based on the blockchain to significantly reduce IP administration costs and improve IP use. IP dLedger connects the on-chain (blockchain) to the off-chain (centralized database) systems using IP codes that combine hash values and timestamps. Similar to the web hypertext method, this connective feature of IP dLedger enables users who click on identification information registered in a blockchain network to access, through a hyperlink, a centralized database of enormous volumes of related IP information. Therefore, IP dLedger can reduce IP administration costs, increase IP usage, and facilitate safe and convenient use of the IP data.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, the vast majority of Internet services used to distribute hypermedia content follow a centralized model, which is highly dependent on servers and raises several quality and security concerns. Among other issues, this centralized model creates single points of failure, requires trust on providers to avoid censorship and personal data misuse, and results in a scenario where digital content tends to disappear or be inaccessible over time, for example, when a content creator stops maintaining a site or when the content is moved to another location. To improve this, it is necessary to replicate data and follow more distributed models. Nevertheless, current platforms to distribute content in this way, either do not offer an effective mechanism to maintain the privacy of their users or they offer full-anonymity, which contributes to the dissemination of content that goes beyond the law and moral standards of many users. This paper proposes a novel distributed architecture that enables hypermedia resource distribution ensuring censorship resistance and conditional k-anonymity. In the proposed system, users form groups to share hypermedia content where the anonymity of the publisher is preserved only if the publication follows a set of rules defined by the group. To this end, the proposed system uses threshold discernible ring signatures to enable conditional k-anonymity, the Ethereum blockchain platform to manage groups and user identities, and the InterPlanetary File System to store and share hypermedia resources in a distributed way. This document provides the design for the proposed architecture and protocols, it evaluates system risks and its security properties, and it discusses the proposal in general terms.},

However, there is a need to develop an authentication scheme that can protect the privacy of vehicles and secure them against attacks such as insider attacks and repudiation attacks. In this article, we present a scheme that performs vehicle registration and message forwarding in the VANETs and appends the transactions to the blockchain. The proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme using blockchain technology enables vehicles and Trusted Authorities (TA) to authenticate vehicles while preserving privacy. The proposed scheme facilitates privacy-preserving authentication by deploying the scheme on a decentralized network. The proposed scheme ensures privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and transparency during vehicle authentication for VANETs. In the proposed scheme, an authentication process is automated with the use of a smart contract. We comparatively evaluate the security and performance of the proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme with the state-of-the-art literature.

 abstract = {Protecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.},

 abstract = {There are several distributed ledger protocols potentially suitable for the Internet of things (IoT), including the Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and IOTA. This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic –the smart contracts– and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.},

 abstract = {Diabetes poses a global health challenge, demanding continuous monitoring and expert care for effective management. Conventional monitoring methods lack real-time insights and secure data-sharing capabilities, necessitating innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.},

While cryptocurrencies might be the most well-known use case of blockchain technology, it is wrong to assume that this technology is restricted to the financial area. Indeed, many blockchain use cases are being developed today in different areas. Due to the complexity of certain processes, a new technology associated to blockchain has appeared – smart contracts. These digital contracts act like traditional contracts, with the major difference being their automaticity. In this article, we aim to discuss how blockchain and smart contracts may be used together in order to improve organizational operations.

The performance of these market mechanisms is contrasted with existing mechanisms from the literature with respect to electricity bills, market efficiency, fairness, and blockchain feasibility using a comprehensive list of indicators including costs and profits, fairness, market efficiency, and technical viability. Compared to traditional billing, ICBM and HAC increase sellers’ profit by 88% and 66% respectively, while both impose 13% more costs on buyers. ICBM and HAC also set the fairest prices compared to the existing markets. ICBM is shown to improve blockchain feasibility and market efficiency due to lighter on-chain calculations, and absolute clearing mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that HAC outperforms standalone auctions in every aspect which endorses the hybridization benefits.},

In general, the waste management sector has struggled with low consumer trust, fraud, manipulation, significant manual processes, and low levels of information and control. Recent events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted, in particular, the role of trust in effective public policy making and consumer behavioural change. Here we propose a hybrid blockchain solution called a Polkadot parachain. Polkadot is a blockchain technology that connects a network of blockchains, each called a parachain, that can be customised to the business needs of a given application. This solution provides the cost benefits, scalability, and control of a permissioned or private blockchain while providing the security, verifiability, and trust of a public blockchain. The solution is developed with a design science approach and combines three typically separate blockchain use cases: supply chain tracking, incentivisation through a payment system, and gamification to achieve a complete solution for waste management. We provide a detailed discussion on the design of this blockchain solution with the use of blockchain functionality assessed against the criteria and development approaches found in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how such a blockchain can be implemented with the Substrate blockchain development framework.},

 abstract = {Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).},

Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity.

We evaluate the promising but under-explored direction of Sybil avoidance using network latency measurements, according to which two identities with equal latencies are suspected to be operated from the same node, and thus are likely Sybils. Network latency measurements have two desirable properties: they are only malleable by attackers by adding latency, and they do not require any trust between network participants. Our basic SybilSys mechanism avoids Sybil attackers using only network latency measurements if attackers do not actively exploit their malleability. We present an enhanced version of SybilSys that protects against targeted attacks using a variant of the flow correlation attack, which we name TrafficJamTrigger. We show how the message flows of Round-Trip Time measurements can be used to expose attack patterns and we propose and evaluate six classifiers to recognize these patterns. Our experiments show, through both emulation and real-world deployment, that enhanced SybilSys can serve a fundamental role for Web3, effectively establishing connections to real users even in the face of networks consisting of 99% Sybils.},

To help close this research gap, we investigate how blockchain-based loyalty programs transform B2C relations through innovative customer services that bear important properties of a sharing economy. Specifically, we identify-five potential advantages of blockchain-based programs over traditional loyalty programs pertaining to usage, accrual, relevance, expiration, and transferability. We then apply expectancy theory to assess consumers’ perceptions in two empirical studies, both of which reveal an overall preference for blockchain-based loyalty programs over traditional models: an analysis of 5,059 Twitter tweets detects more positive feedback for the blockchain-based program, and a survey of 206 consumers reveals a significantly more positive attitude toward the blockchain-based loyalty program with respect to accrual, relevance, expiration, and transferability.},

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain.},

 abstract = {The public’s health depends on a reliable drug supply chain. Recently, the number of drug counterfeit has increased drastically, resulting in thousands of victims suffering from poisoning and/or treatment failures, which have resulted in new expectations on drug supply chain traceability. Indeed, the drug supply chain involves many parties having heterogeneous interests and are usually reluctant to share traceability data with each other. Furthermore, existing traceability and provenance systems for drug supply chains suffer from separated data storage, lack of information sharing transparency, and trust. Decentralized blockchain-based solutions are advocated to address these limitations by realizing decentralized trustless systems. In this work, we present a fully decentralized, blockchain-based drug traceability solution, worthy of seamless integrating IoT devices throughout the chain. It uses both smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage to remove the need for middleman and to provide trusted, secure and immutable transaction history. Moreover, to preserve the traceability of drugs, it ensures and enforces data provenance and data integrity in the proposed IoT environment by using blockchain Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We give a test and validation of the approach’s effectiveness in enhancing drug traceability supply chains, as well as an analysis of the approach’s costs and security.},

 abstract = {Easy access to data is one of the main avenues to accelerate scientific research. As a key element of scientific innovations, data sharing allows the reproduction of results and helps prevent data fabrication, falsification, and misuse. Although the research benefits from data reuse are widely acknowledged, the data collections existing today are still kept in silos. Indeed, monitoring what happens to data once they have been handed to a third party is currently not feasible within the current data sharing practices. We propose a blockchain-based system to trace data collections and potentially create a more trustworthy data sharing process. In this paper, we present the LUCE (License accoUntability and CompliancE) architecture as a decentralized blockchain-based platform supporting data sharing and reuse. LUCE is designed to provide full transparency on what happens to the data after they are shared with third parties. The contributions of this work consist of i) the design of a decentralized data sharing solution with accountability and compliance by design and ii) the inclusion of a dynamic consent model for personalized data sharing preferences and for enabling legal compliance mechanisms. We test the scalability of the platform in a real-time environment where a growing number of users access and reuse different datasets. Compared to existing data sharing solutions, LUCE provides transparency over data sharing practices, enables data reuse, and supports regulatory requirements. The experimentation shows that the platform can be scaled for a large number of users.},

In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.},

 abstract = {In this paper, an integrated blockchain-based energy management platform is proposed that optimizes energy flows in a microgrid whilst implementing a bilateral trading mechanism. Physical constraints in the microgrid are respected by formulating an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, which is combined with a bilateral trading mechanism in a single optimization problem. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the problem to enable distributed optimization and a smart contract is used as a virtual aggregator. This eliminates the need for a third-party coordinating entity. The smart contract fulfills several functions, including distribution of data to all participants and executing part of the ADMM algorithm. The model is run using actual data from a prosumer community in Amsterdam and several scenarios of the model are tested to evaluate the impact of combining physical constraints and trading on social welfare of the community and scheduling of energy flows. The scenario variants are trade-only, where only a trading mechanism is implemented, grid-only where only OPF optimization is implemented and a combined scenario where both are implemented. Results are compared with a baseline scenario. Simulation results show that import costs of the whole community are reduced by 34.9% as compared to a baseline scenario, and total energy import quantities are reduced by 15%. Total social welfare is found to be highest without a trading mechanism, however this platform is only viable when all costs are equally shared between all households. Furthermore, peak imports are reduced by over 50% in scenarios including grid constraints.},

Collaboration is interesting and important in connecting the digital context with the physical world (IoT) to feed processes with data or send data. However, it also presents multiple challenges, such as the lack of trust between participants with each other and additional privacy and security problems in the communicated data. Fraud detection is crucial for many type of organisations that deal with B2B transactions (banking, fintech, health, etc.) and are therefore exposed to a high risk of fraud. Fraud detection requires expensive professional investigations and intensive collaboration between processes of different organisations. This issue could be mitigated by effectively managing digital evidence, fostering trust and ensuring security for various stakeholders involved in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach to modelling and deploying any collaborative business process scenario, ensuring trust, security, and data privacy. Collaboration-level agreements are defined as a means to ensure trust, security, and data privacy. To accomplish this, our approach enables the automatic generation Smart Contract templates for the collaboration-level agreement specification involving different stakeholders in the collaboration. The Smart contracts are deployed in a Blockchain to ensure that the collaboration-level agreement conditions are signed by the parties. To validate the feasibility of our approach, a proof-of-concept for a fraud detection scenario is implemented, where different metrics are tested in relation to a set of threats and vulnerabilities.},

However, DFL faces incentive and security challenges in the decentralized framework. To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.},

A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked.},

 abstract = {The 5G mobile Internet facilitates contents generation for online communities and platforms through human-to-human collaboration. Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile giving users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of a smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.},

 abstract = {Blockchain has become the technology enabler in delivering modern Smart Grid 2.0 functionalities. Many services including Peer-to-Peer energy trading, distribution network management, financial settlements, and energy data management are catered through blockchain-enabled platforms. However, areas such as service quality-based pricing strategies, supply–demand balancing in distribution system to attain enhanced reliability and consumption-oriented rewarding mechanisms need improving in order to achieve the full benefits of the envisaged grid architecture. In response, this study proposes a novel Blockchain-as-a-Service for Energy Trading (BaaSET) platform, which offers reputation-based services, executed through smart contracts for smart grid applications. Reputation-based grid operations are automatically executed through smart contracts deployed onto a blockchain. The reputation is estimated using power quality and reliability indices, obtained through grid measurements. Further, tests have been conducted to evaluate the associated latency and the implementation cost of the proposed blockchainized service architecture. Test results signify the performance to be comparatively better considering the state-of-the-art. The results further suggest alternatives to improve the scalability of the architecture, to cater the increasing number of stakeholders in the SG 2.0 environment.},

 abstract = {With the development of the energy Internet, more distributed generators are connected to the power grid, resulting in numerous heterogeneous energy networks. However, different energy networks cannot perform efficient energy trading in the centralized management mode, this deeply affecting the complementary ability of heterogeneous energy, resulting in the islanded energy phenomenon. In this model, the same energy on the chain is traded within the chain, and the heterogeneous energy on different chains is traded across chains. To trade energy between heterogeneous energy networks more efficiently, the blockchain-based cross-chain model is proposed based on the existing infrastructure. Heterogeneous energy nodes are assigned to different energy sub-chains and cross-chain energy transactions are performed through a relay-chain, which utilizes the improved Boneh–Lynn–Shacham signature scheme consensus algorithm based on the proof-of-stake and practical Byzantine fault tolerance. The experimental simulations on energy trading efficiency, throughput, and security, show its superiority over existing systems. Further, the simulation results provide a reference for the application of cross-chain technology in energy interconnection.},

@article{ZHANG2024100175,
 abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in real estate investments that utilize blockchain technology. Traditional real estate investments usually involve third-party intermediaries for verifying and recording informal real estate transactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-based real estate investment model and presents a detailed description of the real estate register authentication aspect of the model. The model uses blockchain technology to create tamper-evident records of real estate transactions and provide secure authentication and verification for informal real estate transactions. Meanwhile, each real estate transaction is recorded in a block, and all transaction records are kept on the blockchain. This means that inventors can access these transaction records and verify their authenticity and validity. The system can also use smart contracts to automate the process of real estate transactions, which further improves transaction efficiency and reduces costs. Furthermore, the model's timestamp and authentication mechanism can eliminate third-party intermediaries and ensure the authenticity and validity of real estate transactions through distributed ledgers and verification mechanisms. Overall, blockchain-based real estate systems offer advantages of security, transparency, efficiency, and cost reduction. With ongoing blockchain advancements, these systems are expected to play a crucial role in future real estate investment transactions.},

 abstract = {It is crucial to ensure the privacy and authenticity of patients’ medical data in the medical insurance claim process, but in the current medical insurance claim process, there are some problems such as low efficiency, complex service, unreliable data and data leakage. Therefore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of patients’ medical data, we can improve the current issues by employing blockchain, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof technology. In this paper, we propose a novel medical insurance claim scheme based on smart contracts, blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme mainly involves two scenarios: medical insurance purchasing and medical insurance claiming. In the privacy-preserving transaction phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and privacy of the transactions between the patients and the insurance companies by using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and the homomorphic encryption algorithm under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In the identity privacy-preserving phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and the privacy of patients’ identities by integrating Schnorr protocol and Fiat–Shamir heuristic method. The security analysis, the computation cost and the communication cost of our scheme are given. Compared with our referred schemes, the performance evaluation shows that our scheme not only meets the requirements of the legality of the medical insurance claim, but also ensures the authenticity and privacy of the patients’ medical data. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is feasible and has an acceptable time overhead.},

 abstract = {Federated learning combines with fog computing to transform data sharing into model sharing, which solves the issues of data isolation and privacy disclosure in fog computing. However, existing studies focus on centralized single-layer aggregation federated learning architecture, which lack the consideration of cross-domain and asynchronous robustness of federated learning, and rarely integrate verification mechanisms from the perspective of incentives. To address the above challenges, we propose a Blockchain and Signcryption enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning (BSAFL) framework based on dual aggregation for asynchronous cross-domain federated learning scenarios. In particular, we first design two types of signcryption schemes to secure the interaction and access control of collaborative learning between domains. Second, we construct a differential privacy approach that adaptively adjusts privacy budgets to ensure data privacy and local models' availability of intra-domain user. Furthermore, we propose an asynchronous aggregation solution that incorporates consensus verification and elastic participation using blockchain. Finally, security analysis demonstrates the security and privacy effectiveness of BSAFL, and the evaluation on real datasets further validates the high model accuracy and performance of BSAFL.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we utilise blockchain technology (BT) and circular q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (Cq-ROFS) to address practical issues related to urban transportation and supply chain management (SCM). Recognising the weaknesses of earlier approaches such as circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets (C-IFS), we work Cq-ROFS to better accommodate imprecise input. Novel approaches that use into metaverse settings are being investigated as a means of addressing the complex problems associated with urban mobility. This study use the SWARA-AROMAN approach to evaluate potential blockchain integration possibilities for metaverse urban mobility. Sensitivity analysis and comprehensive evaluation yield powerful insights into the robustness and adaptability of solutions. With these findings at their disposal, policymakers will be more equipped to take on unpredictability and take advantage of opportunities for sustainable urban mobility. To enhance urban transportation solutions in the dynamic metaverse, future strategies should concentrate on improving processes and exploring novel technology. Ultimately, this research emphasises how critical it is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and ongoing innovation if we hope to influence the patterns of urban mobility in the metaverse.},
