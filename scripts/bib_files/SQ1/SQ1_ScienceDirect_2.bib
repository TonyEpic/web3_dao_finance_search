abstract = {Our understandings of money, possessions, and ownership are all changing dramatically as consumption becomes digital and virtual. The Metaverse is an imagined future space where these building blocks of neoliberal production and consumption are delinked. We examine these changes through the affordances of cryptocurrencies, algorithmic collectibles, and NFTs. We seek to disambiguate these efforts at disintermediation through online auctions and speculation. We present practical implications for artists, art institutions, buyers, and investors. We theorize new forms of ownership with fractional ownership and fractionalized property rights. And we seek to understand why some consumers pay astronomical prices for digital art that includes simple and often silly artwork with limited property rights. To do so we distinguish alternate, but sometimes overlapping, buyer motivations in the wild world of crypto art as we purportedly move toward the Metaverse.}

Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile giving users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of a smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.}

The need for a comprehensive study addressing BC bloat solutions arises due to the scarcity of knowledge in this emerging area. This study advances knowledge along with practical insights and inspires innovative approaches to address BC bloat. This research explores various techniques proposed to combat BC bloat. Two technique themes are identified: on-chain and off-chain techniques. On-chain techniques focus on updating the consensus mechanism, block size, or database partition. This study identified five on-chain techniques: structural modification, pruning, sharding, ephemeral BC, and zk-SNARKs. Off-chain techniques focus on processing in parallel, bundling transactions, or handling transactions off-chain. Further, three off-chain techniques identified are off-chain storage, historical data storage, and light clients’ techniques. These recommendations aim to optimize resources use, enhance scalability, and maintain data integrity. However, these may compromise several BC capabilities, such as security, privacy, and data loss. The applicability of these techniques for resource-constrained devices is also explored. Future research should include further investigation into the performance and applicability of these techniques, especially in resource-constrained environments like IoT and fog computing.}

Despite considerable progress, most ZDM approaches focus on the accuracy of the inspection process, often neglecting critical factors for application in the shop floor. On one hand, near real-time methods are needed for early defect detection and containment. On the other hand, data scarcity is an issue causing AI methods to overfit. Another concern is the accountability of AI results, since even if an AI pipeline is successfully deployed, its predictions are not verifiable in the long term. In this work, we explore a real-time solution based on lightweight Deep Residual Networks and Blockchain technology to address these issues. Concretely, we propose a two-phase training strategy to boost the performance of baseline classifiers while maintaining low inference times. The performance of the proposed methodology is presented in two different industrial use cases with strict timing requirements, one concerning battery assembly line and the other antenna manufacturing. We validate the proposed method for defect detection and compare the results with common training strategies demonstrating an improvement of 3% and 10% in F1-score and accuracy on the two cases respectively, while lowering inference time by 2.2× compared to existing light architectures. Contributing to the accountability of AI results, we present an IoT framework using Blockchain deployed in Private Ethereum.}

The contribution of this paper is the first application of toolkits theory to Web3, reframing its development as a problem of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of distributed information. We provide implications for the role of developers as user innovators, the economic problem of emergent toolkit stacking, and the design of toolkit business models.}

Traditional real estate investments usually involve third-party intermediaries for verifying and recording informal real estate transactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-based real estate investment model and presents a detailed description of the real estate register authentication aspect of the model. The model uses blockchain technology to create tamper-evident records of real estate transactions and provide secure authentication and verification for informal real estate transactions. Meanwhile, each real estate transaction is recorded in a block, and all transaction records are kept on the blockchain. This means that inventors can access these transaction records and verify their authenticity and validity. The system can also use smart contracts to automate the process of real estate transactions, which further improves transaction efficiency and reduces costs. Furthermore, the model's timestamp and authentication mechanism can eliminate third-party intermediaries and ensure the authenticity and validity of real estate transactions through distributed ledgers and verification mechanisms. Overall, blockchain-based real estate systems offer advantages of security, transparency, efficiency, and cost reduction. With ongoing blockchain advancements, these systems are expected to play a crucial role in future real estate investment transactions.}

We accordingly identify five types of covert communication patterns, each with different roles for covert senders and covert receivers, which enable one-to-one and one-to-many communication. Using Bitcoin as an example, we analyze the data distribution of covert channels within the block and transaction structure. Furthermore, we compare the hiding patterns and covert communication patterns and discuss the challenges and promising directions to achieve secure, robust, and cost-effective covert communication using blockchain. This work can provide valuable insights into the potential of blockchain technology for covert communication and lay the foundation for future research in this area.}

We then apply expectancy theory to assess consumers’ perceptions in two empirical studies, both of which reveal an overall preference for blockchain-based loyalty programs over traditional models: an analysis of 5,059 Twitter tweets detects more positive feedback for the blockchain-based program, and a survey of 206 consumers reveals a significantly more positive attitude toward the blockchain-based loyalty program with respect to accrual, relevance, expiration, and transferability.}

The purpose of the study is to identify and summarize the challenges of blockchain implementation in the maritime industry and within maritime ports. Based on the literature and previous research findings, 18 challenges to the blockchain implementation were identified and categorized into four dimensions: human factor, operational, organizational, and technological. The findings show that different priorities among ports, low level of digitalization, scalability of blockchain systems, and unwillingness to change business routine are important challenges.}

A federated average learning of recurrent zeroing neural dynamics designed self-adaptive fractional-order proportional integral derivative (FAL-ZND FOPID) controller is proposed for distributed frequency control of networked microgrid (NMG) system. By employing a blockchain-enabled distributed control system and implementing supplementary control, the proposed method efficiently regulates the frequency of P2P energy trading. The contract participation matrix, which facilitates the transmission of energy demand information from consumers to prosumers, is computed as part of the supplementary control. Thus, it provides the power reference signals to prosumers who participate in ancillary frequency services. Overall, the blockchain implementation ensures that the transfer of signals remains secure from cyber threats. To showcase this concept, the prosumer and consumer nodes are established within the blockchain network using Raspberry Pi devices. These devices are then connected to the NMG setup in OPAL-RT through the socket interface and communicate via TCP/IP protocol.}

abstract = {Electronic Commodity Trading has a pivotal role in our economic activities. In the literature, there is a classic problem called “Fair Exchange” which is fundamental to electronic commodity trading. It means the participants can receive the exchange item of the counterparty as they have agreed on before. Since the ownership of items online is often authorized by digital signatures, we focus on the problem of the fair exchange of digital signatures in this paper. As the concept of the Metaverse becomes popular recently, what we are concerned about is how the fair exchange will evolve in a metaverse. It is said that the metaverse is a vision of how the next generation of the internet will operate and the research for the fair exchange problem in it is essential for a wide range of applications like trading a (Non-fungible-token) NFT. Many cryptographic fair exchange protocols are proposed to deal with such a problem. However, most of them should rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and the security is restricted by the TTP. The way the metaverse will work is still being defined. But it will probably provide users with a decentralized environment and a fair exchange protocol relying on a TTP seems unsuitable for it. Recently, researchers present some blockchain-based fair exchange protocols to get rid of or reduce the power of a TTP. But these blockchain-based protocols face new challenges. Firstly, cryptography pairing operations are often contained in such a TTP-free protocol and cost too much for the blockchain. Secondly, the player may hang for an unacceptably long time of the latency of the blockchain network. Thirdly, it is difficult to protect the privacy of the signatures while making the whole protocol verifiable at the same time. To bridge these research gaps, this paper presents a novel signature exchange protocol called DFSE which is decentralized, verifiable, efficient and autonomous. To give a real-world evaluation, we perform the experiment on the live test network of Ethereum and the results show that our protocol is feasible.}

The devices, having heterogeneous computation power, protocol stack, or storage power, can send or receive various services by communicating through the internet. These services inevitably demand a secure and reliable network system to interchange the data or information for their impressive utilization. One proven solution to attain this objective is embedding Trust Management System (TMS) that aims to reduce risk or uncertainty associated with interacting adversary devices by capturing their dynamic behavior in the system. With TMS, devices compute and maintain trust value on the interacting devices by observing their behavior with different interaction instances. This trust information is exchanged between the devices to assess the global reputation of devices and facilitate devices’ decisions when there is a lack of direct interactions. For systems having enormous low-power devices, one crucial aspect of TMS is secure and timely dissemination, management, and storage of trust information to accurately assess devices’ dynamic behavior. Addressing this issue, we present a blockchain-assisted scalable trust model, BLAST-IoT, for IoT systems of heterogeneous devices in this paper. BLAST-IoT intends to ensure secure dissemination and storage of trust information leveraging on the functionalities provided by blockchain technology. It adopts a semi-distributed approach where direct trust information, computed by IoT end devices, is processed and stored by some high-power edge devices running public blockchain networks to handle impediments caused by power-deficient IoT devices. The effectiveness of BLAST-IoT has been evaluated through implementation and simulation-based results for trust convergence and assessment accuracy in the dynamic IoT environment. Further, the throughput performance of BLAST-IoT has been examined with an increase in network load.}

abstract = {In this paper, we utilise blockchain technology (BT) and circular q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (Cq-ROFS) to address practical issues related to urban transportation and supply chain management (SCM). Recognising the weaknesses of earlier approaches such as circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets (C-IFS), we work Cq-ROFS to better accommodate imprecise input. Novel approaches that use into metaverse settings are being investigated as a means of addressing the complex problems associated with urban mobility. This study use the SWARA-AROMAN approach to evaluate potential blockchain integration possibilities for metaverse urban mobility. Sensitivity analysis and comprehensive evaluation yield powerful insights into the robustness and adaptability of solutions. With these findings at their disposal, policymakers will be more equipped to take on unpredictability and take advantage of opportunities for sustainable urban mobility. To enhance urban transportation solutions in the dynamic metaverse, future strategies should concentrate on improving processes and exploring novel technology. Ultimately, this research emphasises how critical it is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and ongoing innovation if we hope to influence the patterns of urban mobility in the metaverse.}

We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.}

We propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain-based novel decentralized software testing system. The proposed system aims to detect and prevent vulnerable code by synergizing deep learning capabilities and smart-contract-powered blockchain. The vulnerability detection is performed automatically without relying on manually written rules. We propose a non-vulnerability score range map to classify the source code. Furthermore, we integrate an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to ensure efficient storage over the blockchain. We conduct a testbed-based experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of AI and blockchain integration for secure code development and testing.}

Virtual power plants (VPPs) have emerged as an important paradigm for aggregating and managing numerous DERs. This paper proposes a decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) multilayer energy trading framework to facilitate optimized coordination of DERs within a VPP context. A control center, prosumers, and service operators constitute the model’s multi-layered architecture. Profits from feed-in tariffs, ancillary services, and P2P sales are optimized for revenue while expenses are minimized using a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Smart contracts enable prosumers to trade energy units in the Ethereum blockchain with ease via a participatory web platform. The effectiveness of the framework in synchronizing power supply and demand within the VPP by coordinating the charging and discharging of storage systems in accordance with consumption patterns is demonstrated through performance evaluation. In contrast to conventional centralized architectures, the proposed framework utilized decentralized architecture efficiently consolidates and optimizes distributed energy resources (DERs) to improve grid stability and renewable energy utilization.}

This paper focuses on how the recent developments in decentralized blockchain technologies can be adopted for tendering of construction projects to improve the traditional process by eliminating intermediaries and ensuring transparency as well as data security. A novel, decentralized blockchain-based tendering system is presented for construction projects, leveraging (i) decentralized smart contracts to execute the tendering steps, including storage of the information throughout the process, management of the bid bonds, evaluation of the bids, and awarding of the contract according to the preset conditions, (ii) blockchain-integrated decentralized storage systems to exchange and store off-chain documents that are related to tendering, and (iii) decentralized application to facilitate the participants' interaction with the proposed system during the tendering process. The proposed system presents a new method for achieving a decentralized, secure, trustworthy, and transparent tendering environment among project participants. The outcomes of the system indicate the potential of future blockchain research for achieving autonomous and decentralized tendering sytems.}

In general, the waste management sector has struggled with low consumer trust, fraud, manipulation, significant manual processes, and low levels of information and control. Recent events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted, in particular, the role of trust in effective public policy making and consumer behavioural change. Here we propose a hybrid blockchain solution called a Polkadot parachain. Polkadot is a blockchain technology that connects a network of blockchains, each called a parachain, that can be customised to the business needs of a given application. This solution provides the cost benefits, scalability, and control of a permissioned or private blockchain while providing the security, verifiability, and trust of a public blockchain. The solution is developed with a design science approach and combines three typically separate blockchain use cases: supply chain tracking, incentivisation through a payment system, and gamification to achieve a complete solution for waste management. We provide a detailed discussion on the design of this blockchain solution with the use of blockchain functionality assessed against the criteria and development approaches found in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how such a blockchain can be implemented with the Substrate blockchain development framework.}

abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.}

abstract = {Power systems are undergoing rapid transitions to incorporate renewable sources of generation and to combat climate change. The next stage of transitions will lead to a shift from large-scale, centralized systems to networks of small-sized, distributed electricity systems, which require distributed or decentralized ledgers for database management for efficient transactions. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) are a form of decentralized ledgers where the transactions (energy, information, and money) among various entities are maintained. One such DLT is blockchain technology which offers several advantages. Data recorded in blockchains are difficult to tamper with; have privacy protection; facilitate fast, accurate, and real-time settlement of financial transactions. Contemporary research has started focusing on their possible applications in energy systems. State-of-the-art suggests that while business and market aspects have been extensively discussed, the electrical constraints and implementation methodologies have not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, all the reviewed projects have implemented only peer-to-peer transactions that are not scalable. To incorporate the new entities like prosumers, inter-microgrid transactions, and interactions with the legacy power grid, new structural and operational frameworks are necessary. The proposed research explores the possibility of developing blockchain enabled smart microgrids (BSMG) with the above frameworks. It aims to build a conceptual framework of BSMG, including the transaction protocols and process flows. It proposes the inclusion of network constraints in a three-level transaction setup executed over a four-layered architecture. Another practical challenge is that BSMGs may be set up on different blockchain platforms. Hence, this paper also proposes implementing Inter-Blockchain Protocol for the first time to include interoperability and communication between different platforms. Finally, the performance metrics that will be used to validate the BSMGs are outlined.}

abstract = {In the context of extreme societal polarization, activists have mobilized to protest injustices and claim their rights, yet such efforts often fall short of goals because demands normally are directed to government or firms that offer superficial responses. Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.}

abstract = {In modern paradigm of smart grid, prosumers can trade energy peer-to-peer in a transactive energy market to reduce energy costs and improve energy efficiency. In addition, cloud energy storage (CES) is a type of shared energy storage systems with high economic efficiency that can provide energy storage services for prosumers and become an active player in energy trading. However, transactive energy implementation in power systems has several challenges such as data privacy and security. In existing researches, energy trading mechanisms rely on central authorities, where security and privacy cannot be maintained. Therefore, this paper presents a decentralized stochastic optimization model of transactive energy management based on blockchain in the presence of CES. In this framework, the smart contract based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers technique is deployed on the Ganache and Ethereum blockchains, and the YALMIP toolbox along with CPLEX solver handle decentralized optimization in the MATLAB software. The numerical results demonstrate that not only the capacity of distributed generations is fully utilized, but also total costs of smart homes are reduced by more than 27%, and the total grid’s delivery power to smart homes is decreased by more than 24% compared to the inflexible scheduling.}

The wireless networks of connected vehicles called Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) are designed to improve the traffic management on highways with comfort and safety for drivers and passengers. However, there is a need to develop an authentication scheme that can protect the privacy of vehicles and secure them against attacks such as insider attacks and repudiation attacks. In this article, we present a scheme that performs vehicle registration and message forwarding in the VANETs and appends the transactions to the blockchain. The proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme using blockchain technology enables vehicles and Trusted Authorities (TA) to authenticate vehicles while preserving privacy. The proposed scheme facilitates privacy-preserving authentication by deploying the scheme on a decentralized network. The proposed scheme ensures privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and transparency during vehicle authentication for VANETs. In the proposed scheme, an authentication process is automated with the use of a smart contract. We comparatively evaluate the security and performance of the proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme with the state-of-the-art literature. The proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme is significantly reliable and transparent in authenticating vehicles while preserving privacy.}

On its face, this shift to a trustless web calls into question the traditional conceptions of and requirements for trust. However, in this article, we caution against claims that advocate distrusting Web3 on the basis that, despite how quickly Web3 technology is advancing, the psychological processes through which people perceive and make sense of the social world remain fundamentally unchanged. Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research.

However, existing MCS systems operate in a centralized manner, giving rise to several challenges, including privacy, security, incentives, and dependence on a central service provider. Blockchain is a novel application paradigm that incorporates point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, intelligent contracts, distributed data storage, and other computing technologies, creating a shift from the current centralized paradigm to a decentralized paradigm. Nonetheless, the convergence of MCS and blockchains necessitates addressing numerous fundamental challenges arising from their merger. This paper examines the major issues facing MCS systems and blockchain’s potential role in addressing them. We present the MCS-blockchain integrated deployment strategies, architectural designs, and core blockchain technology principles that contribute significantly to the performance of blockchain-based MCS applications. Additionally, the advancement of blockchain technology and its impact on MCS system security and performance requirements are investigated. Finally, we highlight current research gaps and future research opportunities that may inspire the deployment of novel blockchain-based MCS systems.}

abstract = {The rise in the cost of essentials affects every nation around the world, but it has become a major concern for developing nations. It is getting increasingly difficult to keep up with rising prices for everyday items in these countries, where the majority of the population is from the middle class or lower middle class. Inflation, pandemics, wars, and other important variables all contribute to price increases. There may be another significant factor at play, which is supply-chain corruption. The supply chain's unreliable, chaotic, and opaque nature is to blame for this corruption. We are concentrating on the agri-food supply chain in our study. Because many of the current agri-food supply chains are intricate and challenging to monitor, dishonest parties can exploit the situation. Therefore, we suggested a thorough blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to identify the source of price increases. The private Ethereum blockchain was used in the suggested system. Since the private Ethereum blockchain is more efficient, safe, and fast, it was chosen. Smart contracts were created to describe the system and its underlying rules and laws. Furthermore, in order to showcase the usefulness of our smart contracts, we exhibited a sample decentralized application to support our hypothesis. We also gave the system a complete security and vulnerability assessment to make sure it is operating properly and is protected from threats and attacks. Due to the use of blockchain, the system is immutable, transparent, and simple to track and monitor. The proposed system has demonstrated greater transparency, traceability, reliability, speed, security, and cost-efficiency compared to conventional systems. It effectively traces the origin of corruption in the supply chain, providing a more straightforward means to tackle concerns related to price hikes.}

We develop a conceptual model and testable propositions that extend the work of McKnight et al. (2001, 2002, 2011) to the blockchain ecosystem based on an integrative literature review. We conceptualize trust as a multidimensional, multi-object construct combining three major objects of trust: algorithmic trust in the blockchain protocol (platform), trust towards peers and services providers, and trust in decentralized applications (product). The model reflects the process of building a trust layer for users and institutions on top of the trustless technology. The paper demystifies the trust building process, from initial trust to knowledge-based trust, and its dimensions within the blockchain ecosystem, and, consequently, helps practitioners to build strategies that increase users' trust. The contribution to the academic literature resides in the unification of multiple perspectives on trust within an integrative conceptual framework to point out the mechanisms of trust building process, as well as to identify future research directions.}

However, DFL faces incentive and security challenges in the decentralized framework. To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.}

This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions.

The amount of transactions generated and stored in such Web3 applications is significant and, in its raw form, usually not searchable by users. Existing Web3 transaction indexing and search engines are predominantly centralized and, therefore, can manipulate search results or censor particular queries. With the proliferation of Web3 transactions and applications, a decentralized and censorship-resistant search primitive is becoming essential. We present DeScan, a decentralized and censorship-resistant indexing and search engine for Web3. Users index their local Web3 transactions using custom rules that output triplets. Generated triplets are bundled in a distributed transaction graph that is searchable by other users. To coordinate search and distribute the storage of the transaction graph over peers in the network, we build upon a Skip Graph (SG) data structure. Since the Skip Graph does not provide any resilience against adversarial peers that censor searches, we propose four modifications to improve its robustness. We implement DeScan and conduct experiments with up to 12 800 peers and 10 million Ethereum transactions. Our experiments show that DeScan with our modifications enabled can tolerate 20% adversarial peers and 35% unresponsive peers without disruption. Moreover, we find that searches in DeScan are usually completed well within a second, even when the network grows. Finally, we show that storage and network costs are evenly distributed amongst peers as the network grows.}

The research applies human-centered design theory, combined with the multiple case study method, to generate a cross-case synthesis, revealing common threads, specific trends, key reflections, angles of analysis, and design approaches that can facilitate this work in the future. The findings and conclusions from this study aim to be useful and relevant to practitioners, private sector actors, and researchers. The research aims to address existing research gaps and promote a more informed, coordinated, responsible, and rigorous research agenda and community of practice for the use of blockchain applications in the humanitarian sector. Throughout the discussion, this study highlights the frictions related to variables such as context, agency, and participation. A framework for analysis, focused on four key variables: process, people, program and product, is proposed to provide a basis for comparative analysis, and eventually, a series of propositions for interested stakeholders. The study concludes that blockchain technology has the potential to address cost and time inefficiencies in cash and voucher assistance, but success of implementation is highly dependent on design, context, and stakeholder engagement. The paper recommends continued research in this area to further validate findings and expand the use of blockchain technology in humanitarian and development programs.

The proposed system combines IoT and blockchain technology. IoT sensors placed on nuclear waste drums allow to generate information regarding their status in real time. Blockchain provides an immutable repository for the drum monitoring information decentralized across a set of stakeholders, like nuclear waste originators, waste packaging and transportation companies, storage sites, and regulatory bodies. Following the principles of design science research, we describe a prototype implementation of the proposed system based on a private instance of Ethereum and its application in a pseudo-real use case in Korea. The proposed system is the first of its kind evaluated by practitioners and aims to set a reference for future implementations in this field.}

This article introduces DA2Wa, a protocol designed to establish a secure pairing between a cryptocurrency wallet and a DApp, both of which run as isolated applications on the same machine. The protocol utilizes a six-character PIN exchange mechanism, delivering a security level equivalent to that of Bluetooth. To demonstrate the security of DA2Wa, we employ Tamarin Prover, a tool for symbolically modelling and analysing security protocols.}

However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet. The experimental results show that our scheme can more securely solve the problem of excessive privacy leakage of medical users within a feasible timeframe.}

However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.}

This paper proposes OpenFL, a novel, collateral-backed reputation system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This system aims to foster trust among participants in a decentralized FL environment. We present a fully autonomous smart contract platform specifically tailored to facilitate FL processes among anonymous users. Furthermore, we address potential security concerns by detailing our strategies to mitigate various attack vectors. To validate our system’s efficacy, we conducted experiments on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our findings demonstrate OpenFL’s capability to overcome the inherent limitations of permissionless blockchains while highlighting the significance of open-access protocols in this context. OpenFL can potentially broaden the participant base in trust-sensitive applications by reducing entry barriers, thus substantially contributing to decentralized machine learning.}

Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms. To effectively leverage decentralized trust as a novel aspect of competitive actions, business leaders must pursue Web3 technologies that are reliable, high-growth market segments that are credible, and ventures that are investable.}

The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified — one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon. This is to promote transparency and verifiability within and among government processes.}

Recently, the number of drug counterfeit has increased drastically, resulting in thousands of victims suffering from poisoning and/or treatment failures, which have resulted in new expectations on drug supply chain traceability. Indeed, the drug supply chain involves many parties having heterogeneous interests and are usually reluctant to share traceability data with each other. Furthermore, existing traceability and provenance systems for drug supply chains suffer from separated data storage, lack of information sharing transparency, and trust. Decentralized blockchain-based solutions are advocated to address these limitations by realizing decentralized trustless systems. In this work, we present a fully decentralized, blockchain-based drug traceability solution, worthy of seamless integrating IoT devices throughout the chain. It uses both smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage to remove the need for middleman and to provide trusted, secure and immutable transaction history. Moreover, to preserve the traceability of drugs, it ensures and enforces data provenance and data integrity in the proposed IoT environment by using blockchain Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We give a test and validation of the approach’s effectiveness in enhancing drug traceability supply chains, as well as an analysis of the approach’s costs and security.}

Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.}

Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.}

However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain. While solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria. Despite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.}

abstract = {Medical equipment plays a crucial role in the global healthcare industry, towards the delivery of high-quality medical care and contributing to positive patient outcomes. The traditional method of handling pre-owned medical equipment often leads to improper disposal of functional devices in landfills, compelling healthcare providers to invest in costly brand-new equipment. Several proposals have been put forth to establish trading platforms that facilitate the resale of pre-owned medical equipment. However, existing solutions are characterized by a centralized approach, and face challenges related to traceability, certification, system se-curity, and equipment reliability. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that is capable of orchestrating the resale, leasing, and auctioning of pre-owned medical equipment. Blockchain smart contracts are utilized to automate the resale and leasing process, register stakeholders with authenticity, transfer and verify ownership, and maintain public reputation scores of entities. A comprehensive overview of the architectural components, sequence diagrams, and algorithms that define the operations of our solution is provided. In addition, we develop and test a working implementation of the smart contracts to verify the feasibility of our proposed solution in terms of execution cost and code security. Through a discussion of the proposed solution's key components and concepts, we showcase our solution's ability to fulfill the specified requirements and attain the main objectives. Moreover, we evaluate and compare our solution with existing works in terms of capabilities and robustness, and explore potential adaptations and extensions of our architecture to allow for a wide range of additional use cases. Our smart contract code has been made publicly available on GitHub.}

abstract = {The main objective of this article is to present a prototype that integrates blockchain and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to digitize information across a generic Supply Chain (SC). Blockchain bring many benefits to the operation of improving provenance and reliability, such as, digitizing the interaction among SC actors to allow implementation of smart contracts to support a secure and authenticated chain. In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.}

However, IoT suffers from many limitations like energy, resource constraints, scalability, security, availability, etc. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another similar technology that has many features that are capable of solving many of the limitations of the conventional IoT system. So, suitably incorporating SDN technology into the conventional IoT system, an improved version of IoT namely an SDN-based IoT network system has been evolved. This system is capable of resolving many of the limitations of IoT. Since this newer SDN-based IoT version is enriched with better energy and resources, it can undertake higher computational loads to resolve security issues. In the security domain, Blockchain is a state-of-the-art security-based technology in recent times which has already been implemented in the fields of cryptocurrency effectively. So, Many research opportunities emerge out in adapting Blockchain-based technology suitable for the SDN-based IoT Networking domain. This paper deals with the investigations carried out by the past researchers on various security aspects of the IoT, SDN, and SDN-based IoT systems and their solutions using various technologies, including that of Blockchain. It was concluded that the convergence of Blockchain in IoT and SDN and its combination (SDN-based IoT) resolved many security issues. Many prominent research gaps still persist here to be resolved. This can be dealt with as a future scope of research opportunities in the domain.}

Given the scarcity of understanding about the role of specific technologies enabling value creation through digital connectivity, we investigate how blockchain-based digital connectivity shapes value creation in international digital platforms and ecosystems (DPEs). Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity. Moreover, this interdisciplinary explanation reveals why certain features theoretically attributed to blockchain (e.g., decentralization, trust) do not always realize or support value creation in practice in IB based on the DPE business model.}

This significantly jeopardizes community health in addition to exacerbating climate change, thus it is essential need to move swiftly to incorporate renewable energy sources by employing advanced information and communication technologies. However, this change brings up several security issues emphasizing the need for innovative cyber threats detection and prevention solutions.

One possibility is to securely store and represent personalized consumer preferences. This manuscript illustrates the application of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a means to present consumer preference data and deliver personalized product recommendations directly to consumers. To do this, we initiated a study involving a small group of 31 respondents who participated in the “What’s Your Whisky” survey. Their responses were transformed into unique pieces of artwork generated by an algorithm. Furthermore, whisky recommendations were derived from these survey responses and integrated into the corresponding artwork. These personalized artworks, which represent each respondent’s whisky taste preference and top whisky selection, can be minted onto a blockchain as NFTs. This process enables respondents to securely own and retain them in their digital wallets, thus creating an immutable record of their whisky taste preferences and personalized recommendations. Finally, a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the value of personalized artwork NFTs. Respondents were asked for preferences between artwork derived from their taste preferences to those with the same whisky recommendations but with randomly sourced background art. Binomial test results revealed a clear preference for artwork based on their personal affirmed that respondents favored artwork based on their personal survey responses.}

In the real unmanned intelligent collaborative production process, each SF exists as an independent individual peer. However, due to the selfishness of SFs and intelligent manufacturing equipment (IME), they do not actively participate in data sharing, which brings serious obstacles to the collaborative development of SF. In order to solve the above problems, this paper combines blockchain technology and game theory technology to propose a high-efficiency data sharing incentive method based on the Stackelberg game. Specifically, We first take the SF as the leader and the IME as the follower, and we define the data sharing incentive problem among SFs as the master–slave game problem. Then, the lower game problem and the upper game problem are solved, respectively, and finally the Nash equilibrium is derived. Then, a high-efficiency data sharing incentive method based on the Stackelberg game is designed and implemented. Finally, we conducted simulation experiments on the method proposed in this paper. Through theoretical and simulation experiments, it has been proven that the proposed method effectively reduces the impact of the selfishness of SFs and IME and improves the efficiency of data sharing among SFs.}

Trusted data storage servers will participate in the data-sharing system to provide users with convenient data access and storage services. Currently, the vast majority of researchers design data-sharing systems based on centralized trusted authorities and key management centers, but they tend to ignore the problems of trust dependency and data leakage that exist in centralized trust and lead to the overall untrustworthiness of the system. To solve the above problems, this paper considers the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) to provide trusted authentication for data-sharing entities, but the traditional PKI has CA root trust and scenario adaptation problems, so we optimize the traditional PKI model for data-sharing scenarios and call it an improved PKI. Combining the decentralized trust property of blockchain, this paper proposes a TDS-NA scheme based on blockchain and improved PKI to build a distributed trusted, and secure data-sharing system in a semi-trusted network environment. TDS-NA can secure shared data in data sharing, and provide digital certificates that support entity-trusted authentication and reliable access control while designing digest blocks for efficient data auditing. In this paper, we demonstrate that the TDS-NA scheme is able to resist man-in-the-middle attacks and certificate forgery attacks through formal security analysis while satisfying the necessary security properties of data-sharing systems. We implement a prototype of the TDS-NA scheme in ethereum smart contracts and finally verify the security and feasibility of TDS-NA through experimental comparison and analysis.}

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

In this paper, we propose a collusion-resistant and privacy-protected FL crowdsourcing scheme implemented by smart contracts. Our proposed scheme supports fair reward distribution in FL, as well as ensuring data privacy and user privacy using homomorphic encryption and pseudo-identity techniques. The evaluation results show that the time cost and gas consumption of the proposed scheme are realistic in practice. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative evaluation of single worker and multi-workers (crowdsourcing) approaches using Alexnet, Resnet and VGG models, showing that FL with greedy mechanism can significantly accelerate the model training without compromising models’ accuracy. Finally, we present a comprehensive security analysis of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {More edge users opt to use Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect their data (e.g., health data, social data, e-governance data, etc.), which are stored in central cloud service providers (CSPs). However, this compromises data privacy and creates issues with collusion attacks. Current ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) schemes with and without blockchain have only partially addressed these issues. Ongoing challenges remain to be resolved, including large-universe attribute management, secret key verification, and malicious attribute authorities (AAs) tracking. Therefore, we propose a decentralized access control scheme (namely BLUMA-CPABE) integrating blockchain with multi-authority ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (MA-CP-ABE). The scheme not only supports large-universe, policy hiding, and AAs tracking, but it also utilizes on- and off-chain mechanisms to alleviate the computation burden of the blockchain. In addition, we develop a verifiable key distribution approach in which AAs are configured as blockchain consensus nodes capable of issuing, signing, validating, and disseminating secret keys as transactions on-chain. It guarantees the keys’ security and reliability. To incentivize authorities to control newly added attributes proactively for large-universe, we enhance the Proof-of-Authority (called PoA＋) consensus mechanism in multi-authority scenarios. It allows authorities to take turns proposing and confirming new blocks based on three contribution indicators: attribute management contribution, data decryption contribution, and block validation gain. The proposed scheme is proven statically secure while resisting collusion attacks. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our scheme.}

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution has significantly increased the adoption of Digital Twins (DTs) across various sectors, including intelligent manufacturing, automation, logistics, and medical analysis. Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.}

abstract = {This research proposes a system to store transaction records from a payment gateway based on digital payments by utilizing blockchain technology and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as distributed storage. In digital payments, the possibility of online fraud or theft of customer data is a problem that needs to be solved. Although the solution is to use a Payment Gateway with security standards to prevent these problems, the system is still centralized and vulnerable to the possibility of system failure or data changes by irresponsible people. Blockchain furnishes a secure and unalterable record for documenting payment transactions. Conversely, IPFS presents a decentralized and immune-to-censorship approach for storing and accessing data. The usage of these technologies guarantees the secure storage of payment transaction data and related documents (such as invoices and receipts) while effectively thwarting data manipulation or censorship attempts. Therefore, this research aims to build a blockchain technology system to increase security and maintain the integrity of the data generated from the Payment Gateway. This research using distributed data storage using IPFS to save transaction from the payment gateway data. Based on the evaluation and security analysis results, implementing a blockchain technology system to store transaction records from digital-based payment gateways can improve data security and integrity. In the gas fee increase analysis, the gas fee will increase according to the total number of bytes generated when the transaction is made, where each byte will cost 12 gwei to pay the gas fee.}

To address these issues, this paper presents a novel decentralized blockchain-based system for accident/incident information management of construction projects. The proposed system leverages the benefits and advantages of blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized IPFS storage to address the security transparency, tampering, and trustworthiness issues of the conventional approaches.

On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in many smart applications such as smart cities, smart agriculture, healthcare, industry, etc. In addition, the importance of IoT-based architectures has increased with the emergence of innovative technologies such as 5G networks and quantum computing. Electrochemical sensors (ECS) have recently been used in IoT-based architectures thanks to their easy integration into smart systems in many fields such as pharmaceutical, food, medical diagnosis, clinical, genetic analysis, wearable, forensic identification, and monitoring of environmental variables. However, Although IoT-based systems have ensured the availability of sensor data in traditional architecture, there are many challenges, such as low latency, availability, real-time data traceability, and security. In addition, new challenges regarding security and privacy have emerged in the system as the ever-growing smart connected IoT devices generate a significant amount of heterogeneous data. Given these challenges, in this paper, we propose PPFchain, a new federated learning-enabled blockchain-based framework to ensure the security and privacy of sensor-IoT-based architectures using sampled ECS data. PPFchain has a lightweight, low-cost, high-performance architecture in the IoT-based blockchain network. In the architecture, we used the federated model and cryptographic primitives for user and data privacy in off-chain fog nodes considering performance. Moreover, we compared with traditional blockchain models using various performance metrics for system performance in a distributed architecture, such as an event and storage-based smart contract. In addition, the results show that the PPFchain provides accuracy, efficiency, and enhanced security.}

abstract = {The emergence of the Web3 paradigm has led to more and more systems built on blockchain technology and relying on cryptocurrency tokens – both fungible and non-fungible – to sustain themselves and generate profit. The growth and success of these platforms are strongly dependent on the growth and evolution of the trade relationships among users. In this context, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanism behind the evolution and growth dynamics of these economic ties: however, in these systems the trade relationships are strictly intertwined with social dynamics, posing significant challenges in the analysis. One of the most important mechanisms behind the evolution of social networks is the triadic closure principle: given the strict link between social and economic spheres, the mechanism emerges as a potential candidate among mechanisms in literature. Therefore in this work, we extend the existing methodology for triadic closure studies and adapt it to directed networks. We performed an analysis centered around 3-node subgraphs known as “triads” and statistically significant triads referred to as “triadic motifs”, both from a static and temporal perspective. The methodology was applied to various decentralized socio-economic networks with distinct levels of social components. These networks include currency transfers from the blockchain-based online social media platform Steemit, trade relationships among NFT sellers and buyers on the Ethereum blockchain, and a blockchain-based currency designed for humanitarian aid called Sarafu. Our measurements show how triadic closure is relevant during the evolution of these platforms and, for a few aspects, more impactful than centralized online social networks, where triadic closure is also incentivized by recommendation systems. Moreover, we are able to highlight both similarities and differences across networks with different levels of social components, both from a static and temporal standpoint. Overall our work presents strong evidence that triadic closure is an important evolutionary mechanism in decentralized socio-economic networks. Our findings provide a stepping stone in the study of decentralized socio-economic networks. Understanding the evolution of other decentralized networks, not following the same Web3 paradigm or with different social components will provide valuable insight into the understanding of dynamics in decentralized systems and potentially improve their design process.}

To enhance trading efficiency and pricing fairness, as the major challenges of P2P market designs, this study introduces two new market mechanisms, Hybrid Auction Coalition (HAC), and innovative coalition business model (ICBM), respectively. The performance of these market mechanisms is contrasted with existing mechanisms from the literature with respect to electricity bills, market efficiency, fairness, and blockchain feasibility using a comprehensive list of indicators including costs and profits, fairness, market efficiency, and technical viability. Compared to traditional billing, ICBM and HAC increase sellers’ profit by 88% and 66% respectively, while both impose 13% more costs on buyers. ICBM and HAC also set the fairest prices compared to the existing markets. ICBM is shown to improve blockchain feasibility and market efficiency due to lighter on-chain calculations, and absolute clearing mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that HAC outperforms standalone auctions in every aspect which endorses the hybridization benefits.}

However, one of its shortcomings is the lack of a defense mechanism against the ability of a single user to generate a surplus of identities, known as the Sybil attack. Web3 has a Sybil attack problem because it uses peer sampling to establish connections between users. We evaluate the promising but under-explored direction of Sybil avoidance using network latency measurements, according to which two identities with equal latencies are suspected to be operated from the same node, and thus are likely Sybils. Network latency measurements have two desirable properties: they are only malleable by attackers by adding latency, and they do not require any trust between network participants. Our basic SybilSys mechanism avoids Sybil attackers using only network latency measurements if attackers do not actively exploit their malleability. We present an enhanced version of SybilSys that protects against targeted attacks using a variant of the flow correlation attack, which we name TrafficJamTrigger. We show how the message flows of Round-Trip Time measurements can be used to expose attack patterns and we propose and evaluate six classifiers to recognize these patterns. Our experiments show, through both emulation and real-world deployment, that enhanced SybilSys can serve a fundamental role for Web3, effectively establishing connections to real users even in the face of networks consisting of 99% Sybils.}

Many researchers have proposed fine-grained access control schemes and searchable encryption algorithms to support privacy-preserving data sharing. But there still exist two challenges. First, the existing schemes are computationally intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-limited IoT terminals. Second, they rely on a central server to honestly conduct search operations, making them unable to tackle malicious servers. To this end, we propose a blockchain-enabled data-sharing scheme for IoT that supports lightweight, secure, and searchable data sharing. We design an outsourcing attribute-based encryption algorithm to alleviate the overhead of resource-limited IoT terminals, which reduces the local encryption and decryption to a constant level. Instead of relying on central servers, we leverage smart contract to execute ciphertext retrieval, ensuring the accuracy of search results. Formal security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is chosen-plaintext secure under the DBDH assumption. Experimental simulation shows that it reduces the search time by at least 79.9%, the encryption and decryption complexities to both O(1).}

Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices. We conclude by addressing how established companies can prepare for a more decentralized internet.}
