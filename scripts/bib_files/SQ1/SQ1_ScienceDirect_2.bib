abstract = {The 5G mobile Internet facilitates contents generation for online communities and platforms through human-to-human collaboration. Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile giving users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of a smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.}

The need for a comprehensive study addressing BC bloat solutions arises due to the scarcity of knowledge in this emerging area. This study advances knowledge along with practical insights and inspires innovative approaches to address BC bloat. This research explores various techniques proposed to combat BC bloat. Two technique themes are identified: on-chain and off-chain techniques. On-chain techniques focus on updating the consensus mechanism, block size, or database partition. This study identified five on-chain techniques: structural modification, pruning, sharding, ephemeral BC, and zk-SNARKs. Off-chain techniques focus on processing in parallel, bundling transactions, or handling transactions off-chain. Further, three off-chain techniques identified are off-chain storage, historical data storage, and light clients’ techniques. These recommendations aim to optimize resources use, enhance scalability, and maintain data integrity. However, these may compromise several BC capabilities, such as security, privacy, and data loss. The applicability of these techniques for resource-constrained devices is also explored. Future research should include further investigation into the performance and applicability of these techniques, especially in resource-constrained environments like IoT and fog computing.}

abstract = {Real-time and vision-based quality control for industrial processes has drawn great interest from both scientists and practitioners, particularly following the transition to Zero Defect Manufacturing (ZDM) and Industry 4.0. Despite considerable progress, most ZDM approaches focus on the accuracy of the inspection process, often neglecting critical factors for application in the shop floor. On one hand, near real-time methods are needed for early defect detection and containment. On the other hand, data scarcity is an issue causing AI methods to overfit. Another concern is the accountability of AI results, since even if an AI pipeline is successfully deployed, its predictions are not verifiable in the long term. In this work, we explore a real-time solution based on lightweight Deep Residual Networks and Blockchain technology to address these issues. Concretely, we propose a two-phase training strategy to boost the performance of baseline classifiers while maintaining low inference times. The performance of the proposed methodology is presented in two different industrial use cases with strict timing requirements, one concerning battery assembly line and the other antenna manufacturing. We validate the proposed method for defect detection and compare the results with common training strategies demonstrating an improvement of 3% and 10% in F1-score and accuracy on the two cases respectively, while lowering inference time by 2.2× compared to existing light architectures. Contributing to the accountability of AI results, we present an IoT framework using Blockchain deployed in Private Ethereum.}

For this purpose, health standards and semantic web technologies were used for the formal expression of both the insured individual's data and contract terms. Accordingly, a fine-grained data access policy was applied for evaluating contract terms on the basis of relevant data captured in healthcare settings. A prototype was implemented involving the development of several different smart contracts for the Ethereum platform as well as the necessary visual environment for accessing them. The developed system validates various features related to blockchain and smart contract features that are briefly discussed in this work, part of which can be mitigated or resolved through the use of a private permissioned blockchain. The application of well-established techniques for potential malfunctions of external services could also boost the security of the system and prevent it from potential attacks.}

Our aim is to explore how toolkits theory applies to Web3 innovation, proposing that Web3 innovation is being organized through toolkits (e.g., blockchains, token standards, DAO frameworks) that enable efficient organization of sticky information to facilitate innovation. The contribution of this paper is the first application of toolkits theory to Web3, reframing its development as a problem of entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of distributed information. We provide implications for the role of developers as user innovators, the economic problem of emergent toolkit stacking, and the design of toolkit business models.}

Traditional real estate investments usually involve third-party intermediaries for verifying and recording informal real estate transactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-based real estate investment model and presents a detailed description of the real estate register authentication aspect of the model. The model uses blockchain technology to create tamper-evident records of real estate transactions and provide secure authentication and verification for informal real estate transactions. Meanwhile, each real estate transaction is recorded in a block, and all transaction records are kept on the blockchain. This means that inventors can access these transaction records and verify their authenticity and validity. The system can also use smart contracts to automate the process of real estate transactions, which further improves transaction efficiency and reduces costs. Furthermore, the model's timestamp and authentication mechanism can eliminate third-party intermediaries and ensure the authenticity and validity of real estate transactions through distributed ledgers and verification mechanisms. Overall, blockchain-based real estate systems offer advantages of security, transparency, efficiency, and cost reduction. With ongoing blockchain advancements, these systems are expected to play a crucial role in future real estate investment transactions.}

Specifically, we identify-five potential advantages of blockchain-based programs over traditional loyalty programs pertaining to usage, accrual, relevance, expiration, and transferability. We then apply expectancy theory to assess consumers’ perceptions in two empirical studies, both of which reveal an overall preference for blockchain-based loyalty programs over traditional models: an analysis of 5,059 Twitter tweets detects more positive feedback for the blockchain-based program, and a survey of 206 consumers reveals a significantly more positive attitude toward the blockchain-based loyalty program with respect to accrual, relevance, expiration, and transferability.}

It allows individuals, businesses, or organizations to present their projects, ideas, or causes to a global audience and request financial support from a crowd of potential backers. Crowdfunding has gained popularity across various industries, including technology, arts, entrepreneurship, social causes, and more. It provides a democratized approach to financing, allowing innovative and creative ideas to come to life with the support of a diverse community of backers. The current research explores the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts to revolutionize traditional crowdfunding methodologies. Traditional crowdfunding has been plagued by issues such as lack of transparency, centralized intermediaries, slow payment processing, fraud, and limited access. In response to these challenges, blockchain solutions offer a transparent and decentralized approach, allowing contributors to track their contributions, eliminate intermediaries, automate fund disbursement, and enable cross-border transactions. Tokenization and reduced entry barriers further enhance accessibility and participation. The current research presents a conceptual model and implementation of a smart contract-based crowdfunding system using Solidity, addressing these issues and providing a foundation for future research in the field of decentralized crowdfunding. The research scope has been expanded to encompass Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a means of fundraising for startups. Within this context, fungible tokens, which adhere to the ERC-20 standard, are generated using the OpenZeppelin library. These tokens are then subject to approval by the startup, granting authorization to a crowdfunding manager for the purpose of distributing tokens to contributors based on their respective contributions. The percentage of tokens made available for distribution can be customized to suit the specific needs and preferences of the startup.}

Furthermore, multigroup analysis (MGA) demonstrates how different contexts have distinct acceptance predictors. Depending on the context, perceived lower fees, perceived faster settlement, perceived income distribution, perceived fraudproof, and perceived traceability had varying significance. Meanwhile, perceived immutability, perceived process automation, and perceived transparency, even though considered appealing, were not significant in influencing acceptance.

While RT-PCR technology remains the most reliable method for detecting COVID-19, this approach is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, researchers have explored various machine learning and deep learning-based approaches to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases using X-ray images. Machine learning based models can reduce costs and have shorter processing times. However, preserving patient confidentiality poses challenges within such third-party-controlled systems, potentially failing to safeguard patients from potential disgrace and discomfort. Nonetheless, blockchain technology offers the potential to securely store sensitive medical data anonymously, without requiring third-party intervention. Consequently, the combination of deep learning and blockchain might offer a viable solution to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring patient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model of blockchain and deep learning model for automatically detecting COVID-19 using chest X-rays (CXR). The deep learning model includes a stacking ensemble of three modified pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models: VGG16, Xception, and DenseNet169. The model obtained an accuracy of 99.10% and 98.60% for binary and multi-class respectively. Further, to ensure COVID-19 patients’ privacy and security, the Ethereum blockchain has been adopted to store information related to COVID-19 cases. In addition, a smart contract on the blockchain has been designed for handling X-ray images in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).}

Through this research, we have identified key topics such as investment security or corporate challenges that provide valuable insights and structured information essential for industry stakeholders. In summary, this study explores the dynamic interplay between blockchain technology, ICOs, STOs and social media in the industry. It sheds light on the sentiment and implications of the use of this technology and these emerging financial models, offering a nuanced understanding of their impact on the market.

This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services and products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing personal data may result in the extraction of sensitive information, which, in turn, may lead to jeopardizing the users’ privacy. To mitigate this significant risk, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union elaborated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation forces Service Providers to obtain Data Subjects’ explicit consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. Nevertheless, the GDPR’s legislative text does not define how Service Providers must transparently demonstrate that they already have these consents. Moreover, most individuals do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither does this regulation provide them with efficient methods to be aware of what third parties are doing with such data. In order to address this situation, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. The new solution provides public access to immutable evidences that reflect the reached agreements between Data Subjects and Service Providers. In this way, Service Providers can effectively demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are able to control and manage their personal data according to their legitimate rights. We have implemented the new system, and we have performed a detailed study which includes: GDPR-compliance, provided functionality, security and privacy issues, and the cost in terms of gas and US dollars of the different operations to be run on the blockchain.}

Virtual capacity exchange platforms help to mitigate this challenge by exchanging capacities with anonymous participants in market-like peer-to-peer networks. However, its efficiency is hindered by behavioral uncertainties, including a lack of inter-organizational trust in other participants. To leverage the potential of such exchange platforms, this paper reports on a Design Science Research project aiming to derive and validate design principles for establishing trust in inter-organizational capacity exchange in two design iterations. Using blockchain technology, we instantiate six design principles into an artifact and perform experimental evaluations to investigate their effect on perceived trust. Our paper contributes to research and practice by identifying and applying prescriptive design knowledge and advancing our understanding of how to design trust-enabling inter-organizational systems. The originality lies within the empirical investigation of how and why different design principle combinations can be established through blockchain technology as one of the promising approaches for establishing trust. In doing this, we also disclose future pathways for IS and blockchain researchers and practitioners.}

One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment.}

We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.}

Despite these efforts, the process of sharing students’ credentials is complex, error-prone and not completely secure. Our aim is to leverage blockchain technology to mitigate the existing security-related issues concerning the sharing of students’ credentials. Thus, the paper proposes a tamper-proof, immutable, authentic, non-repudiable, privacy protected and easy to share blockchain-based architecture for secured sharing of students’ credentials. To increase the scalability, the proposed system uses a secure off-chain storage mechanism. The performance and viability of the proposed architecture is analyzed by using an Ethereum based prototypical implementation. The test results imply that requests can be executed within few seconds (without block-time) and the system has stability to process up to 1000 simultaneous requests.}

Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker’s revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.}

This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain.}

In general, the waste management sector has struggled with low consumer trust, fraud, manipulation, significant manual processes, and low levels of information and control. Recent events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted, in particular, the role of trust in effective public policy making and consumer behavioural change. Here we propose a hybrid blockchain solution called a Polkadot parachain. Polkadot is a blockchain technology that connects a network of blockchains, each called a parachain, that can be customised to the business needs of a given application. This solution provides the cost benefits, scalability, and control of a permissioned or private blockchain while providing the security, verifiability, and trust of a public blockchain. The solution is developed with a design science approach and combines three typically separate blockchain use cases: supply chain tracking, incentivisation through a payment system, and gamification to achieve a complete solution for waste management. We provide a detailed discussion on the design of this blockchain solution with the use of blockchain functionality assessed against the criteria and development approaches found in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how such a blockchain can be implemented with the Substrate blockchain development framework.}

However, with products becoming increasingly complex, they contain sub-assemblies with components that have sub-components supplied by different manufacturers. This creates a multi-tier supply chain that complicates the propagation of sustainability information necessary to compute the product's carbon emission due to the lack of oversight and potential loss of information from manufacturers in the multi-tier supply chain. Blockchain technology, characterized by its immutability, visibility, and traceability, is a promising medium to propagate sustainability information. Despite the fact that many papers have proposed a system that is viable for products with a multi-tier supply chain in the literature, we have not seen its proof-of-concept yet. This work first proposes a blockchain-enabled system that enables the propagation of environmental sustainability information in a multi-tier supply chain. This paper describes the architecture of the proposed blockchain system and the data structure of each block in the blockchain. Based on the defined architecture, we implemented the proposed blockchain system with Ethereum and tested it using the pseudo-multi-tier supply chain of a torchlight.}

These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.}

As a key element of scientific innovations, data sharing allows the reproduction of results and helps prevent data fabrication, falsification, and misuse. Although the research benefits from data reuse are widely acknowledged, the data collections existing today are still kept in silos. Indeed, monitoring what happens to data once they have been handed to a third party is currently not feasible within the current data sharing practices. We propose a blockchain-based system to trace data collections and potentially create a more trustworthy data sharing process. In this paper, we present the LUCE (License accoUntability and CompliancE) architecture as a decentralized blockchain-based platform supporting data sharing and reuse. LUCE is designed to provide full transparency on what happens to the data after they are shared with third parties. The contributions of this work consist of i) the design of a decentralized data sharing solution with accountability and compliance by design and ii) the inclusion of a dynamic consent model for personalized data sharing preferences and for enabling legal compliance mechanisms. We test the scalability of the platform in a real-time environment where a growing number of users access and reuse different datasets. Compared to existing data sharing solutions, LUCE provides transparency over data sharing practices, enables data reuse, and supports regulatory requirements. The experimentation shows that the platform can be scaled for a large number of users.}

abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.}

abstract = {Web3, the next generation of the Internet, represents a decentralized and democratized web. Although it has garnered significant public interest and found numerous real-world applications, there is a limited understanding of people's perceptions and experiences with Web3. In this study, we conducted an empirical study to investigate the categories of Web3 applications and their popularity, as well as the potential challenges and opportunities within this emerging landscape. Our research was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, we analyzed 200 popular Web3 projects associated with 10 leading Web3 venture capital firms. In the second phase, we collected and examined code-related data from GitHub and market-related data from blockchain browsers (e.g., Etherscan) for these projects. Our analysis revealed that the Web3 ecosystem can be categorized into two groups, i.e., Web3 infrastructure and Web3 applications, with each consisting of several subcategories or subdomains. We also gained insights into the popularity of these Web3 projects at both the code and market levels and pointed out the challenges in the Web3 ecosystem at the system, developer, and user levels, as well as the opportunities it presents. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of Web3 for researchers and developers, which in turn promotes further exploration and advancement in this innovative field.}

The popularity of blockchain technology is increasing as it is trustworthy and cannot be changed; hence making traceability easier for information such as where food came from, thus essential for managing the agricultural food supply chain (SC). On the contrary, suggested SCM systems premised on smart contract technology and blockchain tend to be specifically apply to production and production processes. Through qualitative research, this paper suggests framework for adoption of smart contracts based on Ethereum in the agri-food SC, with the aim to establish means to adopt blockchain for checking food quality and origins in the agri-food supply chain. Remix IDE is utilised to build and test the smart contract. The significance of the framework is realised through ensuring the traceability of product safety and quality.}

However, the management of dual-use drugs presents additional challenges, due to the possibility of misuse, diversion, and tampering. To address these challenges, it is necessary to track the supply chain of these dual-use drugs from the manufacturer to the end user. This research study investigates the use of blockchain technology in the supply chain management of dual-use drugs. This study explores the potential benefits of blockchain in improving the transparency, traceability, and security of the supply chain while reducing the risk of fraud and misuse. Additionally, the consensus algorithm inherent in blockchain technology makes it an ideal solution for preventing the manipulation and illegal export of dual-use drugs.}

abstract = {In the context of extreme societal polarization, activists have mobilized to protest injustices and claim their rights, yet such efforts often fall short of goals because demands normally are directed to government or firms that offer superficial responses. Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.}

The wireless networks of connected vehicles called Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) are designed to improve the traffic management on highways with comfort and safety for drivers and passengers. However, there is a need to develop an authentication scheme that can protect the privacy of vehicles and secure them against attacks such as insider attacks and repudiation attacks. In this article, we present a scheme that performs vehicle registration and message forwarding in the VANETs and appends the transactions to the blockchain. The proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme using blockchain technology enables vehicles and Trusted Authorities (TA) to authenticate vehicles while preserving privacy. The proposed scheme facilitates privacy-preserving authentication by deploying the scheme on a decentralized network. The proposed scheme ensures privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and transparency during vehicle authentication for VANETs. In the proposed scheme, an authentication process is automated with the use of a smart contract. We comparatively evaluate the security and performance of the proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme with the state-of-the-art literature. The proposed privacy-preserving authentication scheme is significantly reliable and transparent in authenticating vehicles while preserving privacy.}

Non-profit organizations primarily rely on fundraising that may involve opaque operations, which leads to the exacerbation of fears that donations may be used for illegal purposes or not reach deserving people. The necessity of charity donations traceability system is inevitable to overcome such concerns, which have an adverse impact on doners’ trust in the donation process. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based donation traceability framework intended to enable all involved parties to trace the progress of charity donations from the moment they are given by donors to the moment they reach the intended recipients. The system is built on a public-permissioned blockchain on the Ethereum platform, with every transaction being recorded as a block in the chain. These blocks of information are immutable and visible to all parties, and they also enable timely and traceable transactions. The proposed framework’s effectiveness is evaluated using a hybrid qualitative approach and proves to improve the traceability of charity donations overcoming the uncertainty associated with current systems.}

As a solution, this paper proposes the connection of the digital building twin with blockchain-based smart contracts to execute performance-based digital payments. First, we conceptualize a technical architecture to connect blockchain to digital building twins. The digital building twin stores and evaluates performance data in real-time. The blockchain ensures transparency and trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards through smart contracts. Next, we demonstrate the feasibility of both the concept and technical architecture by integrating the Ethereum blockchain with digital building models and sensors via the Siemens building twin platform. The resulting prototype is the first full-stack implementation of a performance-based smart contract in the built environment.}

Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) is an effective search scheme based on ciphertexts, which ensures data security. However, with the increase of data on the blockchain, the data retrieval on the blockchain will be difficult.

It is getting increasingly difficult to keep up with rising prices for everyday items in these countries, where the majority of the population is from the middle class or lower middle class. Inflation, pandemics, wars, and other important variables all contribute to price increases. There may be another significant factor at play, which is supply-chain corruption. The supply chain's unreliable, chaotic, and opaque nature is to blame for this corruption. We are concentrating on the agri-food supply chain in our study. Because many of the current agri-food supply chains are intricate and challenging to monitor, dishonest parties can exploit the situation. Therefore, we suggested a thorough blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to identify the source of price increases. The private Ethereum blockchain was used in the suggested system. Since the private Ethereum blockchain is more efficient, safe, and fast, it was chosen. Smart contracts were created to describe the system and its underlying rules and laws. Furthermore, in order to showcase the usefulness of our smart contracts, we exhibited a sample decentralized application to support our hypothesis. We also gave the system a complete security and vulnerability assessment to make sure it is operating properly and is protected from threats and attacks. Due to the use of blockchain, the system is immutable, transparent, and simple to track and monitor. The proposed system has demonstrated greater transparency, traceability, reliability, speed, security, and cost-efficiency compared to conventional systems. It effectively traces the origin of corruption in the supply chain, providing a more straightforward means to tackle concerns related to price hikes.}

To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.}

To address the above challenges, we propose a Blockchain and Signcryption enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning (BSAFL) framework based on dual aggregation for asynchronous cross-domain federated learning scenarios. In particular, we first design two types of signcryption schemes to secure the interaction and access control of collaborative learning between domains. Second, we construct a differential privacy approach that adaptively adjusts privacy budgets to ensure data privacy and local models' availability of intra-domain user. Furthermore, we propose an asynchronous aggregation solution that incorporates consensus verification and elastic participation using blockchain. Finally, security analysis demonstrates the security and privacy effectiveness of BSAFL, and the evaluation on real datasets further validates the high model accuracy and performance of BSAFL.}

This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions.

Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.}

abstract = {The popularity of blockchain technology has bootstrapped many “Web3” applications, e.g., Ethereum and IPFS, that apply distributed ledger technology to store transactions. The amount of transactions generated and stored in such Web3 applications is significant and, in its raw form, usually not searchable by users. Existing Web3 transaction indexing and search engines are predominantly centralized and, therefore, can manipulate search results or censor particular queries. With the proliferation of Web3 transactions and applications, a decentralized and censorship-resistant search primitive is becoming essential. We present DeScan, a decentralized and censorship-resistant indexing and search engine for Web3. Users index their local Web3 transactions using custom rules that output triplets. Generated triplets are bundled in a distributed transaction graph that is searchable by other users. To coordinate search and distribute the storage of the transaction graph over peers in the network, we build upon a Skip Graph (SG) data structure. Since the Skip Graph does not provide any resilience against adversarial peers that censor searches, we propose four modifications to improve its robustness. We implement DeScan and conduct experiments with up to 12 800 peers and 10 million Ethereum transactions. Our experiments show that DeScan with our modifications enabled can tolerate 20% adversarial peers and 35% unresponsive peers without disruption. Moreover, we find that searches in DeScan are usually completed well within a second, even when the network grows. Finally, we show that storage and network costs are evenly distributed amongst peers as the network grows.}

The study examines six pilot projects led by three prominent international NGOs across four countries to identify obstacles to innovation, adoption, and scalability that may arise in this context. The research applies human-centered design theory, combined with the multiple case study method, to generate a cross-case synthesis, revealing common threads, specific trends, key reflections, angles of analysis, and design approaches that can facilitate this work in the future. The findings and conclusions from this study aim to be useful and relevant to practitioners, private sector actors, and researchers. The research aims to address existing research gaps and promote a more informed, coordinated, responsible, and rigorous research agenda and community of practice for the use of blockchain applications in the humanitarian sector. Throughout the discussion, this study highlights the frictions related to variables such as context, agency, and participation. A framework for analysis, focused on four key variables: process, people, program and product, is proposed to provide a basis for comparative analysis, and eventually, a series of propositions for interested stakeholders. The study concludes that blockchain technology has the potential to address cost and time inefficiencies in cash and voucher assistance, but success of implementation is highly dependent on design, context, and stakeholder engagement. The paper recommends continued research in this area to further validate findings and expand the use of blockchain technology in humanitarian and development programs. It also emphasizes the significance of integrating these variables into novel approaches to uphold ethical and professional standards in humanitarian work.}

Recent advances in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have exposed new ways for process and data integration with open data formats, process mapping, and terminology. In construction projects where multiple disciplines produce and share BIM data, mechanisms for defining information priority, provenance and suitability become necessary in order to have consistent and traceable use of data. This includes objects or collection of attributes for data objects that are associated with a discipline or organisation including clear identification of the transaction that has introduced the information. Blockchain can be used to record metadata of BIM objects such as the issuing discipline, object version and responsibility/ liability associated with the data. Blockchain can offer the capability to apply levels of “trust” to individual BIM objects and a more secured framework of collaboration across stakeholders. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based BIM data provenance model to support information exchange in construction projects. By testing the solution in a real-world bridge construction scenario, it has been shown that the approach can recognise the levels of competence and can improve the process of BIM implementation. The proposed approach gives stakeholders more confidence when sharing their BIM data, reduces costs, and improves risk contingencies in construction projects. The paper provides a cost analysis to evidence the implications of using Blockchain for BIM data provenance through an experimental framework supported by an Ethereum public test network. A front-end web page has also been created to facilitate interaction with smart contracts and to monitor the BIM data provenance process.}

Therefore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of patients’ medical data, we can improve the current issues by employing blockchain, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof technology. In this paper, we propose a novel medical insurance claim scheme based on smart contracts, blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme mainly involves two scenarios: medical insurance purchasing and medical insurance claiming. In the privacy-preserving transaction phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and privacy of the transactions between the patients and the insurance companies by using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and the homomorphic encryption algorithm under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In the identity privacy-preserving phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and the privacy of patients’ identities by integrating Schnorr protocol and Fiat–Shamir heuristic method. The security analysis, the computation cost and the communication cost of our scheme are given. Compared with our referred schemes, the performance evaluation shows that our scheme not only meets the requirements of the legality of the medical insurance claim, but also ensures the authenticity and privacy of the patients’ medical data. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is feasible and has an acceptable time overhead.}

Integrating blockchain technology into decentralized FL frameworks is critical to establishing the trust necessary for user participation. However, existing FL systems using blockchain often struggle with scalability, latency, and privacy issues, particularly in permissionless blockchain contexts. This paper proposes OpenFL, a novel, collateral-backed reputation system implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. This system aims to foster trust among participants in a decentralized FL environment. We present a fully autonomous smart contract platform specifically tailored to facilitate FL processes among anonymous users. Furthermore, we address potential security concerns by detailing our strategies to mitigate various attack vectors. To validate our system’s efficacy, we conducted experiments on the Ethereum Ropsten testnet using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our findings demonstrate OpenFL’s capability to overcome the inherent limitations of permissionless blockchains while highlighting the significance of open-access protocols in this context. OpenFL can potentially broaden the participant base in trust-sensitive applications by reducing entry barriers, thus substantially contributing to decentralized machine learning.}

However, most e-auction schemes involve a trusted auctioneer, which is not always credible in practice. Some studies have applied cryptography tools to solve this problem by distributing trust, but they ignore the existence of collusion. In this paper, a blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving and Collusion-Resistant scheme (PPCR) for double auctions is proposed by employing both cryptography and blockchain technology, which is the first decentralized and collusion-resistant double auction scheme that guarantees bidder anonymity and bid privacy. A two-server-based auction framework is designed to support off-chain allocation with privacy preservation and on-chain dispute resolution for collusion resistance. A Dispute Resolution agreement (DR) is provided to the auctioneer to prove that they have conducted the auction correctly and the result is fair and correct. In addition, a Concise Dispute Resolution protocol (CDR) is designed to handle situations where the number of accused winners is small, significantly reducing the computation cost of dispute resolution. Extensive experimental results confirm that PPCR can indeed achieve efficient collusion resistance and verifiability of auction results with low on-chain and off-chain computational overhead.}

However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as “BDSDT” is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99% using both datasets.}

abstract = {The effort to reach the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations has incentivized the adoption of IT solutions in many fields. Many systems for sustainable economic development are now relying on a digital form making them more accessible and provides the access to new functionalities. A very interesting example of such systems are complementary currencies i.e. cooperative currency systems that support national economies to provide humanitarian aid and promote sustainable development. While there are many studies on the principles and case studies of successful complementary currencies, many aspects are still unexplored, especially regarding cooperative behavior. Cooperative behavior in these systems is a key aspect, as complementary currencies are often born out of cooperation among members that face a period of crisis or they usually have the objective of creating bonds of reciprocity and integrating social networks between people, which should lead to increased cooperation. However, there is a lack of studies on many aspects of cooperative behavior in complementary currencies, such as how such behavior changes over time, especially in times of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover how cooperation behavior is affected by time and different geographical locations is still unclear. In this work, we analyze Sarafu, a complementary currency that went digital and now relies on blockchain technology. Sarafu is a successful case of a complementary currency that was used for humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, Sarafu is a perfect case study for the study of cooperative behavior, as it implements a special type of account, the group account, to support cooperation groups. This feature supports the study of group dynamics and behavior. What we find is that Sarafu users exhibit strong reliance on cooperation groups; we also observe that the interaction of users and cooperation groups is influenced by both time and geographical location. The study of group accounts and in general mechanisms that promote cooperation can be useful for other humanitarian or community development projects. Moreover, similar cooperation enhancers could have an important role in other social development projects, and in general, in any setting where there is a strong need to foster cooperation for reaching social good.}

The objective of this study is to prototype a blockchain network that can run a government process as a decentralized application such that it can enhance transparency and verifiability in the public sector. This can be accomplished by identifying a government process that would be converted into a decentralized application. One of these processes would be converted into a decentralized application. Afterwards, a blockchain framework should be identified — one which can create a public permissioned blockchain network. This framework can be used to design and implement the prototype blockchain network which the decentralized application can run on. The final prototype constitutes of smart contracts deployed on an Ethereum test network with a web frontend to easily interact with it. Mechanisms of the application that are deemed necessary to transparency and verifiability of the system are also identified. Finally, the variable cost of the system and possible limitation is explored in the paper. In this regard, the prototype offers a foundation with which other decentralized applications can follow and build upon. This is to promote transparency and verifiability within and among government processes.}

Recently, the number of drug counterfeit has increased drastically, resulting in thousands of victims suffering from poisoning and/or treatment failures, which have resulted in new expectations on drug supply chain traceability. Indeed, the drug supply chain involves many parties having heterogeneous interests and are usually reluctant to share traceability data with each other. Furthermore, existing traceability and provenance systems for drug supply chains suffer from separated data storage, lack of information sharing transparency, and trust. Decentralized blockchain-based solutions are advocated to address these limitations by realizing decentralized trustless systems. In this work, we present a fully decentralized, blockchain-based drug traceability solution, worthy of seamless integrating IoT devices throughout the chain. It uses both smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage to remove the need for middleman and to provide trusted, secure and immutable transaction history. Moreover, to preserve the traceability of drugs, it ensures and enforces data provenance and data integrity in the proposed IoT environment by using blockchain Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We give a test and validation of the approach’s effectiveness in enhancing drug traceability supply chains, as well as an analysis of the approach’s costs and security.}

Conventional monitoring methods lack real-time insights and secure data-sharing capabilities, necessitating innovative solutions that leverage emerging technologies. Existing centralized monitoring systems often entail risks such as data breaches and single points of failure, emphasizing the necessity for a secure, decentralized approach that integrates the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and machine learning for efficient and secure diabetes management. This paper introduces a decentralized, blockchain-based framework for remote diabetes monitoring, IoT sensors, machine learning models, and decentralized applications (DApps). The proposed framework comprises five layers: the IoT Sensor Layer, which collects real-time health data from patients; the Blockchain Layer, leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for secure data sharing and transactions; the machine learning Layer, analyzing patient data to detect diabetes; and the DApps Layer, facilitating interactions between patients, doctors, and hospitals. For intelligent decision-making regarding diabetes based on data collected from different sensors, nine machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, stochastic gradient boosting (SGD), and Naive Bayes, were trained and tested on the PIMA dataset. Based on the performance evaluation parameters such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC), it was found that the AdaBoost model achieved the highest predictive accuracy of 92.64%, followed by the Decision Tree with an accuracy of 92.21% in diabetes classification.}

abstract = {Identity Management Systems (IMS) manage individual profiles, user authorization, authentication, and access privileges. Paper-based profiles and defacement are vulnerable to spoofing, loss, and theft. Digital platforms with efficient IMS boost administrative processes and bring transparency and interoperability among establishments. The traditional paper-based identity systems are slow and rigid. Conventional centralized IMS lack transparency and are vulnerable to single-point failure. This paper presents a blockchain-aware decentralized identity management and access control (BADIMAC) model that mitigates these barriers. BADIMAC allows users to keep their digital identity within their control (i.e., self-sovereign identity). On the other hand, with the help of BADIMAC, service providers across enterprise boundaries can verify their identity without depending on any central authority. BADIMAC offers transparency and better security. The decentralized consensus-based design of BADIMAC enables the verifier to validate claims and establish proof of digital identity with process effectiveness.}

The humanitarian sector has emerged as a powerful mechanism of legitimation for blockchain technology. Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.}

However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain. While solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria. Despite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.}

However, these applications do not provide an open and transparent environment for public participation. This study suggests that PPGISs should be developed as decentralized applications (DApp) based on Ethereum blockchain technology to have a fully open, transparent, and accountable environment for public participation. In a blockchain-based PPGIS, the collected data are securely saved on the blockchain. The validity of the data, replicated on the nodes of the peer-to-peer blockchain network, is ensured through a consensus process without any central control. The data is tamper-free and immutable. Additionally, the data is openly accessible to institutions and citizens. A prototype PPGIS was developed as a DApp through which users can participate in the site selection of urban facilities. Using the application, they compare and rank different criteria. The system solves an analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weights of the criteria. A suitability map is generated afterward and published to be used by both citizens and decision-makers. The feasibility of the application, along with the issues that need to be considered while using blockchain technology for urban planning and development, are thoroughly discussed.}

A key component in preventing safety and quality deficiencies in manufacturing processes is a state-of-the-art traceability system. Accordingly, we propose a blockchain-based traceability architecture to achieve the aspired level of transparency and process security. The proposed blockchain architecture processes manufacturing data entries and defines blockchain nodes, access, as well as consensus algorithm and transaction logic. An Ethereum-based blockchain demonstrator validates the architecture by implementing the logic for automotive product configuration and process sequencing based on the semi-fungible ERC 1155 token, the proof of authority consensus, and an automotive product token smart contract.}

This paper uses Blockchain technology to develop a system where customers can validate a product legitimacy without the need of a corresponding merchant. This system will be able to be used by manufacturers and companies to ensure that their products will be harder to counterfeit, therefore they will gain more trust from customers. The Ethereum blockchain is used to build the proposed model that is capable of tracing every item's creation and transactions, ensuring the credibility of an item's genuineness.

Blockchain bring many benefits to the operation of improving provenance and reliability, such as, digitizing the interaction among SC actors to allow implementation of smart contracts to support a secure and authenticated chain. In technical terms, blockchain is a decentralized database where information recording is secure and blockchain-based traceability in the SC can address shortcomings that exist in centralized solutions. Provenance could be achieved by implementing SC business logic within smart contracts using blockchains. This article presents an architecture of software that combines blockchain with IoT devices that allows traceability of a generic product from source to destination, through multi-echelon suppliers, logistics, manufacturers to the end-customer. The presented software architecture uses the Solana blockchain for the implementation of SC processes and business logic. This blockchain was selected from a review, reported in this article, of several widely used blockchain networks. It was selected mainly due to its speed and cost of transactions. Within the blockchain we store SC related data and events communicated over the internet and mobile application channels, in a Solana blockchain using Solana's native blockchain libraries. the IoT devices used are Sigfox cloud gateway, and Sensit that uses LPWAN (Low power wide area network) wireless telecommunication for data transfer. In our IoT device, the blockchain stores temperature, humidity, light, location, tilting, door opening, vibration, and magnetic field. The goal is to use existing technologies to develop a software architecture for a medium term objective of an implementable generic blockchain for SCs.}

Developing smart contract methods is more difficult than mainstream software development as the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. We report on a new approach to developing smart contracts with the objective of automating the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce the risk of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into the processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.}

Specifically, we analyze the potential and limitations of federated vs. blockchain-based social media platforms as platforms for content creators and provide recommendations for content creators. Given the role of user-generated content in the success of social media platforms, we also provide directions for research and development of decentralized social media to increase their relevance for content creators.}

Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity. Moreover, this interdisciplinary explanation reveals why certain features theoretically attributed to blockchain (e.g., decentralization, trust) do not always realize or support value creation in practice in IB based on the DPE business model.}

This significantly jeopardizes community health in addition to exacerbating climate change, thus it is essential need to move swiftly to incorporate renewable energy sources by employing advanced information and communication technologies. However, this change brings up several security issues emphasizing the need for innovative cyber threats detection and prevention solutions.

Collaboration is interesting and important in connecting the digital context with the physical world (IoT) to feed processes with data or send data. However, it also presents multiple challenges, such as the lack of trust between participants with each other and additional privacy and security problems in the communicated data. Fraud detection is crucial for many type of organisations that deal with B2B transactions (banking, fintech, health, etc.) and are therefore exposed to a high risk of fraud. Fraud detection requires expensive professional investigations and intensive collaboration between processes of different organisations. This issue could be mitigated by effectively managing digital evidence, fostering trust and ensuring security for various stakeholders involved in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach to modelling and deploying any collaborative business process scenario, ensuring trust, security, and data privacy. Collaboration-level agreements are defined as a means to ensure trust, security, and data privacy. To accomplish this, our approach enables the automatic generation Smart Contract templates for the collaboration-level agreement specification involving different stakeholders in the collaboration. The Smart contracts are deployed in a Blockchain to ensure that the collaboration-level agreement conditions are signed by the parties. To validate the feasibility of our approach, a proof-of-concept for a fraud detection scenario is implemented, where different metrics are tested in relation to a set of threats and vulnerabilities.}

Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution has significantly increased the adoption of Digital Twins (DTs) across various sectors, including intelligent manufacturing, automation, logistics, and medical analysis. Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.}

abstract = {This research proposes a system to store transaction records from a payment gateway based on digital payments by utilizing blockchain technology and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) as distributed storage. In digital payments, the possibility of online fraud or theft of customer data is a problem that needs to be solved. Although the solution is to use a Payment Gateway with security standards to prevent these problems, the system is still centralized and vulnerable to the possibility of system failure or data changes by irresponsible people. Blockchain furnishes a secure and unalterable record for documenting payment transactions. Conversely, IPFS presents a decentralized and immune-to-censorship approach for storing and accessing data. The usage of these technologies guarantees the secure storage of payment transaction data and related documents (such as invoices and receipts) while effectively thwarting data manipulation or censorship attempts. Therefore, this research aims to build a blockchain technology system to increase security and maintain the integrity of the data generated from the Payment Gateway. This research using distributed data storage using IPFS to save transaction from the payment gateway data. Based on the evaluation and security analysis results, implementing a blockchain technology system to store transaction records from digital-based payment gateways can improve data security and integrity. In the gas fee increase analysis, the gas fee will increase according to the total number of bytes generated when the transaction is made, where each byte will cost 12 gwei to pay the gas fee.}

An implementation framework is developed using blockchain technologies to record and trace critical attributes during the various life cycle phases of a 3D printing value chain, viz. raw material extraction, chemical processing, polymerization, filament production, 3D printing, and end-of-life recycling of the product. The information on critical attributes of carbon footprint, workers' age, and material flow during the entire value chain is captured to provide authentic output of carbon footprint and labour age during any of the value chain activity. The uniqueness of the current work lies in offering a series of immutable transactions using blockchain technology to comprehend the circularity of 3D printing material and account for the overall carbon footprint produced by a 3D printed product considering its whole value chain. This would improve the traceability and visibility of the material supply chain for 3D printing. On the hindsight, the proposed framework is expected to assist the manufacturing firms to act as responsible manufacturers by providing the authentic data for the computation of environmental assessment as well as social issues of child labour throughout the value chain.}

abstract = {The emergence of the Web3 paradigm has led to more and more systems built on blockchain technology and relying on cryptocurrency tokens – both fungible and non-fungible – to sustain themselves and generate profit. The growth and success of these platforms are strongly dependent on the growth and evolution of the trade relationships among users. In this context, it is of paramount importance to understand the mechanism behind the evolution and growth dynamics of these economic ties: however, in these systems the trade relationships are strictly intertwined with social dynamics, posing significant challenges in the analysis. One of the most important mechanisms behind the evolution of social networks is the triadic closure principle: given the strict link between social and economic spheres, the mechanism emerges as a potential candidate among mechanisms in literature. Therefore in this work, we extend the existing methodology for triadic closure studies and adapt it to directed networks. We performed an analysis centered around 3-node subgraphs known as “triads” and statistically significant triads referred to as “triadic motifs”, both from a static and temporal perspective. The methodology was applied to various decentralized socio-economic networks with distinct levels of social components. These networks include currency transfers from the blockchain-based online social media platform Steemit, trade relationships among NFT sellers and buyers on the Ethereum blockchain, and a blockchain-based currency designed for humanitarian aid called Sarafu. Our measurements show how triadic closure is relevant during the evolution of these platforms and, for a few aspects, more impactful than centralized online social networks, where triadic closure is also incentivized by recommendation systems. Moreover, we are able to highlight both similarities and differences across networks with different levels of social components, both from a static and temporal standpoint. Overall our work presents strong evidence that triadic closure is an important evolutionary mechanism in decentralized socio-economic networks. Our findings provide a stepping stone in the study of decentralized socio-economic networks. Understanding the evolution of other decentralized networks, not following the same Web3 paradigm or with different social components will provide valuable insight into the understanding of dynamics in decentralized systems and potentially improve their design process.}

abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the network of medical devices, software applications, and healthcare information systems used for remote monitoring and delivery of healthcare services. Despite the several advantages of IoMT for today smart healthcare, security issues are growing due to the inadequate computation, limited storage and insufficient self-protection capabilities of IoMT devices. Authentication of IoMT devices is the main requirement to secure IoMT systems. Although, the recent authentication schemes based on tamper-proof decentralized architecture of blockchain technology are robust and enjoy a high level of security, yet they require high computation, more storage, and long authentication time. These issues lead to reduced scalability and time efficiency, which are necessary for large-scale, time-sensitive IoMT systems. To this end, this paper proposes a novel group authentication framework for IoMT Systems. The group authentication scheme is implemented through a four-phase process, including setup, registration, secret construction, and authentication. To enhance both efficiency and scalability, the proposed group authentication framework employs a combination of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) algorithm, and blockchain-based fog computing technologies. We simulated the proposed framework through the Ethereum platform and Solidity language and its performance is evaluated using the Hyperledger Caliper tool. The simulation experiments of the proposed framework showed that the average latency of authenticating IoMT devices was 0.5 second and the throughput was 400 transactions per second. Our analysis of the proposed framework’s performance against other cutting-edge blockchain-based authentication techniques showed that it outperformed them in terms of latency and throughput. A security analysis of the proposed framework was conducted using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The formal and informal security analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework is secure and resistant to potential authentication-related attacks. We also noted that the average latency of the proposed framework maintains a fairly narrow range when the number of submitted transactions rises, indicating that it supports the scalability of the IoMT system.}

This exploratory research investigates why people create, trade or collect NFTs, what value they derive from them, and how online communities contribute to value co-creation. Over the course of two rounds, we interview 38 participants, most of whom are digital natives. We find that engaging with NFTs is the new form of day trading, reflecting financialization of everyday life. The value of NFTs is mainly speculative and utilitarian, and NFTs themselves are best thought of as derivatives. Value co-creation in NFT project communities is largely focused on gaining superior information about the project. We contribute to the crypto-marketing and web3 literature by advancing a novel model of NFT consumer value that extends Holbrook's (1999) typology and distinguishes both positive and negative aspects of consumer value that have been overlooked in mainstream literature. We shed light on the role of communities in an unusual setting: a nascent, illiquid, speculative, informationally opaque market for digital assets. Our study helps creators and brand managers to develop effective NFT strategies.}

But this method is prone to errors and abuse. Many nations utilize digital voting methods to solve the difficulties of paper balloting. A single flaw in digital voting may lead to massive vote-rigging. Election voting methods must be legal, accurate, safe, and convenient. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict acceptance. Due to its end-to-end verification capabilities, blockchain technology was developed to address these problems. To guarantee We have used blockchain technology anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting. By using blockchain our proposed system ensures security, privacy, and integrity. This system provides voter anonymity by keeping the voter information as a hash in the blockchain. It also provides fairness by keeping the casted vote encrypted till the ending time of the election. After ending time, the voter can verify their casted vote, ensuring verifiability. To test our protocol, we put it on Ethereum 2.0, a blockchain platform that uses Solidity as a programming language to create smart contracts. The adoption of smart contracts provides a safe means for performing voter verification, ensuring the correctness of voting results, making the counting system public, and protecting against fraudulent activities. We analyzed the system’s performance based on security and gas costs. It improves in terms of security characteristics and the related cost for the necessary infrastructure.}

To enhance trading efficiency and pricing fairness, as the major challenges of P2P market designs, this study introduces two new market mechanisms, Hybrid Auction Coalition (HAC), and innovative coalition business model (ICBM), respectively. The performance of these market mechanisms is contrasted with existing mechanisms from the literature with respect to electricity bills, market efficiency, fairness, and blockchain feasibility using a comprehensive list of indicators including costs and profits, fairness, market efficiency, and technical viability. Compared to traditional billing, ICBM and HAC increase sellers’ profit by 88% and 66% respectively, while both impose 13% more costs on buyers. ICBM and HAC also set the fairest prices compared to the existing markets. ICBM is shown to improve blockchain feasibility and market efficiency due to lighter on-chain calculations, and absolute clearing mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that HAC outperforms standalone auctions in every aspect which endorses the hybridization benefits.}

However, one of its shortcomings is the lack of a defense mechanism against the ability of a single user to generate a surplus of identities, known as the Sybil attack. Web3 has a Sybil attack problem because it uses peer sampling to establish connections between users. We evaluate the promising but under-explored direction of Sybil avoidance using network latency measurements, according to which two identities with equal latencies are suspected to be operated from the same node, and thus are likely Sybils. Network latency measurements have two desirable properties: they are only malleable by attackers by adding latency, and they do not require any trust between network participants. Our basic SybilSys mechanism avoids Sybil attackers using only network latency measurements if attackers do not actively exploit their malleability. We present an enhanced version of SybilSys that protects against targeted attacks using a variant of the flow correlation attack, which we name TrafficJamTrigger. We show how the message flows of Round-Trip Time measurements can be used to expose attack patterns and we propose and evaluate six classifiers to recognize these patterns. Our experiments show, through both emulation and real-world deployment, that enhanced SybilSys can serve a fundamental role for Web3, effectively establishing connections to real users even in the face of networks consisting of 99% Sybils.}

In this paper we show how it is possible to apply this increasingly popular concept to a traditionally centralized and opaque digital process: Access Control systems. To this aim we expand the XACML standard for Attribute Based Access Control systems with the novel concept of private attributes, i.e. attributes whose values should not be disclosed while still contributing to a policy evaluation result after user consent. Basing our proposal on blockchain systems, we show how to leverage smart contracts and zero knowledge proofs to allow for transparent policies evaluation without disclosing the value of such sensible attributes. Beside formalizing our goals, presenting the system architecture, and discussing its advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional model, we provide a reference example to show our proposal innovative capabilities and provide a prototype experimental evaluation to prove its feasibility.}
