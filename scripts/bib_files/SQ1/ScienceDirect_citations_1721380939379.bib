abstract = {Mourning Revolutions in the Virtual Anastasis is a psychoanalytical and philosophical analysis, that places contemporary technologies and emerging practices for digital and virtual mourning into conversation with Freudian, Jungian, and Lacanian concepts. Through a series of speculations, the text wants to scrutinise the motives behind today's simulative technologies and hypothesise about the future interrelation between the individual and the absence of death. Although the argument is presented by clearly assuming a contrasting position to the use of VR high-tech novelties, the aim is still to offer a point of reflection rather than imposing a unilateral perspective. Therefore, the emphasis is placed on the multifaceted instances of virtually resurrecting loved ones and the inevitable revolutions that will be carried within the mourning process, ultimately departing from orthodox psychological views. The impacts of these revolutions are still largely obscure, but some light will be thrown by examining the internal dynamics of the individual mind and society as a whole. It will be argued how technological advancements, habitually embraced as a sign of evolution, contextualised within the main argumentation, hold a significant risk of being just an illusion of progress: a social regressive phenomenon in its enactment of unconscious fixations. Moreover, thought-provoking claims challenging the psychosocial institutions are delivered to unfold the ethical and political dynamics, particularly concerning psychoanalysis. The reader might find the role of the latter devalued in the critique engaged, in truth, the concluding argumentation is almost an ode to the practice by expressing the hope that by abandoning its tight conservative frame, such an essential tool of analysis will maintain its relevance in the 21st century. The conclusion of such an adventurous exploration will propose psychoanalysis as philosophy with a clinic.}

abstract = {The emergence of eHealth has been instrumental in enhancing healthcare systems, offering improved health services to diverse patients with the aid of cutting-edge technologies. The safe and effective collection, transmission, and accessibility of electronic health records (EHRs) using modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) is essential for realizing the goals of eHealth. However, the use of EHRs by healthcare practitioners creates the risk of data breaches and jeopardizes patient confidentiality. Fortunately, smart contracts and blockchain technology offer effective EHR access control techniques that can enable secure client identification, authentication, and authorization, enhancing the security of EHRs.So, this paper brings effective Blockchain-based solutions using Hyperledger fabric for providing privacy to EHRs. An effective deployment architecture and chain code were generated for design and access control. In this case, the utilization of Hyperledger Fabric as the Blockchain technology introduces a new consensus mechanism, enabling efficient scalability and safeguarding anonymity. By employing Hyperledger Fabric for framework development, the system achieves its objectives. Experimental results are carried out for analyzing the system performance and also computational tests.}

Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.}

Ill-sourced minerals not only finance terrorism, human trafficking, and other major issues in society, but they deter deliberately conscientious organizations from their goals of achieving genuinely sustainable products that are considerate towards the environment and society. This paper aims to understand the problem of responsible sourcing from the point of view of the mining and the metallurgical industry. The study helps identify areas of improvement for this global industry to minimize conflict originating from natural resource development and achieve the noble goal of being certified as Conflict Free. Further, existing paths to accreditation are classified into three categories: Certification Approaches, Analytical Approaches, and Inscription Approaches. A comparison of the approaches is given on parameters like accuracy, cost of implementation, and difficulty of implementation. The study finds that although Analytical Approaches appear to be the most feasible among all the other approaches, their extremely high cost of implementation has prevented their wide adoption, thus perpetuating the difficulty of systematically managing the problem of conflict minerals at scale. Finally, the use of Blockchain Technology (BCT) to overcome the limitations of current mineral traceability schemes is given. Due to limited academic research on this topic, the focus was diverted to how other industries have utilized BCT and proposed the next steps for mineral researchers.}

Smart contracts extend the capabilities of the Blockchain, but the strict gas policy of the EVM limits the implementation of various DApps. On the other hand, Oracle provides a means to use an external execution environment for smart contracts, but its functional limitations and additional costs limit the growth of the DApp market to DApp users. To address the gas consumption crisis of DApps, we designed an event-based resource offloading solution that allows DApp developers to run their own compute servers. By adopting our solution, DApp users only pay the constant and minimized amount of gas fee, while the external server pays highly reduced amount of gas fee instead. We describe the solution in detail with a sample DApp model and mathematically demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution compared to an Oracle-based implementation. Furthermore, we conducted empirical experiment of actual DApp using EVM and verified the reduction of the gas consumption.}

Specifically, AI has shown huge potential for automating and modeling the threat detection mechanism of complicated wireless systems. The current data-driven AI systems, however, lack transparency and accountability in their decisions, and assuring the reliability and trustworthiness of the data collected from participating entities is an important obstacle to threat detection and decision-making. To this end, we integrate smart contracts with eXplainable AI (XAI) to design a robust cybersecurity framework for ZTN. The proposed framework uses a blockchain and smart contract-enabled access control and authentication mechanism to ensure trust among the participating entities. Additionally, with the collected data, we designed Digital Twins (DTs) for simulating the attack detection operation in the ZTN environment. Specifically, to provide a platform for analysis and the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), the DTs are equipped with a variety of process-aware attack scenarios. A Self Attention-based Long Short Term Memory (SALSTM) network is used to evaluate the attack detection capabilities of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the explainability of the proposed AI-based IDS is achieved using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool. The experimental results using N-BaIoT and a self-generated DTs dataset confirm the superiority of the proposed framework over some baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.}

In cases where patients are not physically present in clinics or hospitals, healthcare providers produce observations systems that diagnose and prescribe treatment. In/on patients' bodies, sensors are installed. Data can be exchanged wirelessly between healthcare systems. As a result of the implementation of blockchain-based characteristics (e.g. distributed ledger, decentralized storage, and authentication), healthcare systems can be enhanced. Accordingly, smart contracts are applied for the achievement of more authentication and sharing of records, and requirements for participants automatically. As the number of users or other components increases, blockchains and smart contracts should be able to provide quality service. Technically, smart contracts using blockchains have several challenges that are important, such as scalability, enhanced security, and optimal performance. There is still a question about the scalability of blockchain as there is a significant amount of computational power needed to scale up with a high number of participants in healthcare systems. In this paper, Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) and ZoKrates are used to lower the consumption gas and the scalability of blockchain with smart contracts.}

The key properties of SoCRATES are: (1) it comprises bots that interact with the blockchain according to a set of composable behaviours; (2) it can instantiate a society of bots, which can trigger faults due to multi-user interactions that are impossible to expose with a single bot. Our experimental results show that SoCRATES can expose known faults and detect previously unknown faults in contracts currently published in the Ethereum blockchain.

We are motivated by shedding light on whether the metaverse is just a new marketing buzzword or a new transformative trend. We have identified six areas with key uncertainties, which require agreement and solutions from industry players – the space, the interface, the IT infrastructure, the monetary infrastructure, the digital ID and the energy. These uncertainties will be resolved in a series of cooperative and competitive games among the key stakeholders who will need to work on being aligned on a set of standards. The practical implication is that the metaverse cannot be ignored, but there are non-trivial challenges that need to be resolved first. Our paper provides a framework for practitioners to think through these issues in a more systematic fashion.}

I.e., it lacks comprehensive automation testing techniques. This makes it difficult to cover various scenarios of malicious node behaviors. Therefore, it is an urgent requirement to design an automated testing framework that can comprehensively and efficiently evaluate the security of BFT protocols. This paper proposes BFTDiagnosis, an automated security testing framework with malicious behavior injection for BFT protocols. The framework can automatically configure and initiate protocol testing tasks, and construct consensus nodes to execute different BFT protocols. During testing, consensus nodes can inject malicious behaviors based on pattern matching strategies and malicious behavior triggering mechanisms to simulate various malicious scenarios. Through an Analyzer, BFTDiagnosis can collect protocol runtime data from consensus nodes and calculate four security quantification indicators to evaluate protocol performance. We conducted a load consumption evaluation of BFTDiagnosis. The results indicate its acceptable performance. Additionally, we tested PBFT, Basic-HotStuff, and Chained-HotStuff protocols using the BFTDiagnosis framework, validating the effectiveness of the framework and the rationality of security quantification indicators. Finally, we compared it with nine related technologies and found that BFTDiagnosis is good at testing scenario comprehensiveness and fault localization capability, and can intuitively evaluate the security of BFT protocols through four quantification indicators. The above results show that BFTDiagnosis is an effective and comprehensive security testing framework for BFT protocols.}

While existing solutions could work for distributed IoT cloud applications, storage, computation, and economic cost is still a practical challenging concern. In this paper, we propose a new, cost-lower non-repudiation scheme for IoT cloud applications. The proposed scheme guarantees that neither the IoT client nor the cloud could repudiate a service enjoyment and provisioning. Specifically, the proposed scheme employs a blockchain to achieve non-repudiation. First, when the cloud provides a service, it encrypts the service, stores a cryptographic hash digest of the encrypted service on the blockchain, and then sends the encrypted service to the IoT client. Second, the IoT client needs to acknowledge the hash digest on the blockchain to obtain the service. Third, the cloud sends the decryption key to the blockchain under the IoT client’s public key to finish a service provisioning. We show that the proposed scheme achieves non-repudiation fairly. We prototyped, evaluated, and open-sourced the proposed scheme. Experimental results confirmed the efficiency of the proposed scheme and the speedup compared with the state-of-the-art solution.}

Investigating these services is challenging because of their censorship resistance and decentralization, which renders the existing methodologies for cloud-based storage services and peer-to-peer-based file-sharing services insufficient. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel forensic investigation framework that encompasses identifying, collecting, examining, analyzing potential evidence, and preventing the further distribution of the content. The framework works on each node, peer, gateway, and Internet area of the decentralized storage services, integrating investigation steps on both remote and local sides. The usefulness and applicability of the proposed framework were demonstrated through case studies involving phishing and large-scale file sharing using IPFS with Filecoin.}

Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose.

The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge/cloud computing, 5G networks, big data analytics, and other emerging technologies in IoT systems is leading to the emergence of Smart Systems that support devices to make autonomous decisions in order to improve and facilitate people’s lives. These smart IoT devices produce a huge amount of sensitive data. Thus, establishing Trust between these devices is vital to ensure the security of the sensed data and for the normal functionality of smart systems. To address these challenges, several Trust establishment protocols have been proposed, but they have some limitations such as centralization, the need for human intervention, and the lack of adaptability to smart devices with computation and storage constraints. In this paper, a decentralized trust establishment protocol is proposed for smart IoT devices and is applicable for different scenarios. The protocol provides decentralized identity management, mutual authentication, access control, and secure communication by combining Blockchain technology with PV-SAS-MCA message cross-authentication protocol based on Short Authenticated Strings (SAS). To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to propose a new approach that uses Blockchain as an extra distributed and authenticated channel to exchange Short Authenticated Strings without physical interaction. This helps to allow entities in the Smart IoT environment not only to identify each other but also to exchange their public keys in a secure manner. Moreover, the proposed protocol uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure communications with significantly smaller key sizes and lower computation overhead. Experimental results reveal that the time required to complete the authentication process is less than 90 ms which is a superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art decentralized authentication mechanisms.}

abstract = {Authentication and Authorization are the base of security for all the Technologies present in this world today. Starting from your smartphone where a user authenticates himself before he could access the data inside to Entering into the White House, you must authenticate yourself, and based on that you are authorized. In this digital world where every Business, MNC, Government Body, Companies, Users, etc. needs a website to inform the world about their presence on the internet, provide services online and become a “Brand”, the risk of leaking user's sensitive information increases. It could be dangerous to the users of the hacked website because their sensitive information like a credit card, bank account details, etc. could be sold in the black market of the “dark web”. The role of the dark web is described in the paper and how the data is sold there and what becomes of it. The paper helps to understand how a secure website is developed that promises the user to keep the sensitive information safe, increases the bond of trust between a client and server which results in a long-term relationship. The aim behind developing an authentication system is to keep users’ sensitive information safe so that hackers cannot steal and sell the information on the dark web's back market. To perform this, the developer needs to understand how to implement authentication. NodeJS, with the help of its framework expressJS and some other packages, is used to develop the authentication and authorization system of the website by the research. Previous papers on this field covered the authentication topic in general. This paper overcame that by going deeper into the field and being server-side language specific. The common types of authentication methods used in different types of websites are discussed in detail and the best methods are purposed for the developer to be implemented for a more secure website. This research put light on Artificial Intelligence and blockchain as the future of security of big data.}

They collect reviews concerning several types of items (e.g., shops, professionals, services, songs or videos) in order to rank them according to a given criterion, and to suggest the most relevant ones to their users. However, most of the currently used RSs exhibit two main drawbacks: they are based on a centralized control model and they do not provide reward mechanisms to encourage the participation of users. To deal with these challenges, the architectures of current RSs could be enhanced through blockchain technology, thus providing novel solutions to decentralize them. As a matter of fact, the blockchain technology could be successfully adopted in this context because smart contracts would allow the decentralization of system control, while cryptocurrency and tokens could be used to implement the reward mechanism. In the light of the above considerations, this manuscript presents a decentralized rating framework aimed to support the users of RSs based on blockchain technology, providing a token-based reward mechanism that remunerates users submitting their reviews to incentivize their participation. Moreover, the proposed system provides a flexible strategy to rank items, allowing users to choose among different functions to combine reviews to obtain item ranking. The performance and the cost of using the proposed system have been evaluated on the Ropsten Ethereum test network. For instance, our experiments have shown that the median time required to store a batch of 35 ratings is about 47 s, while the average time required to obtain the score of an item having 6000 ratings is less than 2.5 s.}

Due to their self-executing, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.}

Ethereum is currently the second blockchain platform by market capitalization, it’s also the largest smart contract blockchain platform. Smart contracts can simplify and accelerate the development of various applications, but they also bring some problems. For example, smart contracts are used to commit fraud, vulnerability contracts are deliberately developed to undermine fairness, and there are numerous duplicative contracts that waste performance with no actual purpose. In this paper, we propose a transaction-based classification and detection approach for Ethereum smart contract to address these issues. We collected over 10,000 smart contracts from Ethereum and focused on the data behavior generated by smart contracts and users. We identified four behavior patterns from the transactions by manual analysis, which can be used to distinguish the difference between different types of contracts. Then 14 basic features of a smart contract are constructed from these. To construct the experimental dataset, we propose a data slicing algorithm for slicing the collected smart contracts. After that, we use an LSTM network to train and test our datasets. The extensive experimental results show that our approach can distinguish different types of contracts and can be applied to anomaly detection and malicious contract identification with satisfactory precision, recall, and f1-score.}

The most common solution to offer a familiar experience to naive users are custodial intermediaries, which have the important drawback of centralizing the process, and keeping users away from the advantages of self-sovereign assets control. In this paper, we present a process for the distribution of digital tokens to end users, exploiting “physical” objects for initial distribution. The process is aimed at making the onboarding of users not yet accustomed to blockchain tools and concepts as easy as possible, in a secure and decentralized way.}

This paper reports the design, implementation and validation of middleware software architectures which aim to directly connect client users with manufacturing service providers while improving transparency, data integrity, data provenance and retaining data ownership to its creators. In the first middleware, clients have the ability to directly customize and configure parts parametrically, leading to an instant generation of downstream manufacturing process plan codes. In the second middleware, clients can track the data provenance generated in a blockchain based decentralized architecture across a manufacturing system. The design of digital assets across a distributed manufacturing system infrastructure controlled by autonomous smart contracts through Ethereum based ERC-721 non-fungible tokens is proposed to enable communication and collaboration across decentralized CMaaS platform architectures.

abstract = {In recent years few blockchain based progress payment methods have been proposed to improve the traditional payment process for construction projects. The blockchain based methods require the off-chain real world information to be connected to the blockchain which could be challenging for construction projects. This paper presents a novel building information modeling (BIM) integrated smart contract progress payment administration system, in which as-constructed BIM is used to link the real world with the blockchain. Results of a survey of construction professionals revealed that the proposed system has a significant potential for improving the traditional payment procedure by accelerating the process and by making the progress payments less prone to disputes, especially for lump sum projects. The results also indicate the potential of future research on semi-autonomous BIM integrated smart contract systems to accelerate the adoption of the BIM and smart contract technologies for progress payment administration within the construction sector.}

However, the interoperability and value exchange between different independent blockchain systems is restricting the expansion of blockchain. In this paper, a notary group-based cross-chain interaction model is proposed to achieve the interoperability between different blockchains. Firstly, a notary election mechanism is proposed to choose one notary from the notary group to act as a bridge for cross-chain transactions. Secondly, a margin pool is introduced to limit the misconduct of the elected notary and ensure the value transfer between the involved blockchains. Moreover, a reputation based incentive mechanism is used to encourage members of the notary group to participate in cross-chain transactions. Ethereum-based experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can provide an acceptable performance for cross-chain transactions and provide a higher security level than ordinary cross-chain mechanisms.}

An indispensable condition for the development of smart healthcare is ensuring the security of medical data. The article presents a framework for the implementation of cryptographic proof of smart contracts in healthcare systems. The proposed architecture implements secure procedures for processing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) based on an access control array. The cryptographic proof of smart contracts ensures the security of medical data processing and also allows for non-repudiation, enforceability, and accountability of digital agreements made between system actors. We developed an open data exchange format for EHRs stored in the blockchain based on a nested tree structure and the DOM interface. The article presents algorithms for creating, executing and validating smart contracts for processing medical data contained in EHRs. The proposed solutions were subjected to empirical tests and cybersecurity assessment in terms of threat and vulnerability analysis using the risk analysis method. Steps recommended by ENISA and elements of the methodology developed by NIST were used to develop a strategy for minimizing the identified threats and vulnerabilities.}

abstract = {The growing demand for fresher and better quality food products has led various researchers to propose solutions in this field. Besides the increase in food production, the efficiency of food logistics must be improved to reduce waste. An efficient food supply chain also reduces the final cost of products, increases producers’ incomes, mitigates the environmental impacts, and allows transportation of fresher, healthier foods. Collection and analysis of information on product tracking and stakeholder demands can improve supply chain efficiency, providing important insights to managers. Technological solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twin (DT), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), have been proposed for monitoring and tracking products and analyzing data collected while supporting decision-making. However, there are still few studies about the integration of these technologies, especially DTs, intelligent models, and DLTs. Thus, this work presents a review of the application of these technologies for food logistics, identifying the main requirements and summarizing how they can be applied in each logistics stage. Related surveys are discussed to find gaps in the literature and six research questions are defined and answered, aiming to argue about how the chosen technologies can be applied and combined to attempt the identified requirements. Lastly, this work discusses research opportunities in the fresh food supply chain, presenting some open challenges for adoption while integrating these technologies.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications have gained a huge momentum and have spanned across all domains adding innovations to the prevailing solutions. The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46% uniqueness and 2.38% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks.}

The models involve different tradeoffs in terms of cost, delay, complexity, and privacy, while exploiting key advantages of smart contracts and multiple blockchains that communicate with interledger mechanisms. These include immutably recording hashes of authorization information and policies in smart contracts, resilience through the execution of smart contract code on all blockchain nodes, and cryptographically linking transactions and IoT events recorded on different blockchains using hash-lock and time-lock mechanisms. In the case of two ledgers, an authorization and a payment ledger, the authorization ledger can be a private Ethereum network or a permissioned ledger such as Hyperledger Fabric. For decentralized authorization where a subset of m-out-of-n authorization servers are required, we present two policies for selecting the m servers. The first policy can utilize statistics of the authorization servers such as transaction cost and response time. The second policy selects the first m servers that respond. The proposed models are evaluated on the public Ethereum testnets Rinkeby and Ropsten, and for different implementations on the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned ledger, in terms of execution cost (gas), delay, and reduction of data that needs to be sent to the constrained IoT devices.}

Additionally, we used the Diebold and Yilmaz (DY) spillover index of variance decomposition to validate our findings. Evidence from the analysis suggests positive short- and long-run effects of historical S&P500 returns on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Tether returns––and negative short- and long-run effects of the historical returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Binance, and Tether on S&P500 returns. Alternatively, evidence suggests a negative short- and long-run effect of historical S&P500 returns on Binance returns. The cumulative test of impulse-response indicates a shock in historical S&P500 returns stimulates a positive response from cryptocurrency returns while a shock in historical crypto returns triggers a negative response from S&P500 returns. Empirical evidence of bi-directional causality between S&P500 returns and crypto returns suggest the mutual coupling of these market. Although, S&P500 returns have high-intensity spillover effects on crypto returns than crypto returns have on S&P500. This contradicts the fundamental attribute of cryptocurrencies for hedging and diversification of assets to reduce risk exposure. Our findings demonstrate the need to monitor and implement appropriate regulatory policies in the crypto market to mitigate the potential risks of financial contagion.}

Nearly 30 years later, that definition is taking shape and promises to alter how people live and operate. This next evolution of Internet also known as Web3.0 will combine digital and physical elements. Multiple definitions can be found in the literature, with the most prevalent being the “new internet”, among others such as “democratized virtual society”, “persistent virtual spaces”, “a digital twin of our own world for personalized value creation”. Consequently, the common consensus dictates that Metaverse can be realized as a new form of the Internet, totally reshaped from what is already known. As we are heading towards the coexistence of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 (super smart and intelligent society), this paper attempts to present the definition of Metaverse, its evolution, the advantages and disadvantages, the pillars for the technological advancement which could be the fuel to spark future investigation and discussion as well as to accelerate the development of Metaverse towards the human centric and personalized society. Furthermore, in this manuscript, challenges and opportunities are presented (including Manufacturing), a brief comparison is performed versus Virtual Reality, and a conceptual framework for integrating Metaverse in Manufacturing is also presented.}

While IIoT brings us much convenience, a series of security and scalability issues related to permission operations rise to the surface during device communications. Hence, at present, a reliable and dynamic access control management system for IIoT is in urgent need. Up till now, numerous access control architectures have been proposed for IIoT. However, owing to centralized models and heterogeneous devices, security and scalability requirements still cannot be met. In this paper, we offer a smart contract token-based solution for decentralized access control in IIoT systems. Specifically, there are three smart contracts in our system, including the Token Issue Contract (TIC), User Register Contract (URC), and Manage Contract (MC). These three contracts collaboratively supervise and manage various events in IIoT environments. We also utilize the lightweight and post-quantum encryption algorithm-Nth-degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units (NTRU) to preserve user privacy during the registration process. Subsequently, to evaluate our proposed architecture's performance, we build a prototype platform that connects to the local blockchain. Finally, experiment results show that our scheme has achieved secure and dynamic access control for the IIoT system compared with related research.}

However, different energy networks cannot perform efficient energy trading in the centralized management mode, this deeply affecting the complementary ability of heterogeneous energy, resulting in the islanded energy phenomenon. In this model, the same energy on the chain is traded within the chain, and the heterogeneous energy on different chains is traded across chains. To trade energy between heterogeneous energy networks more efficiently, the blockchain-based cross-chain model is proposed based on the existing infrastructure. Heterogeneous energy nodes are assigned to different energy sub-chains and cross-chain energy transactions are performed through a relay-chain, which utilizes the improved Boneh–Lynn–Shacham signature scheme consensus algorithm based on the proof-of-stake and practical Byzantine fault tolerance. The experimental simulations on energy trading efficiency, throughput, and security, show its superiority over existing systems. Further, the simulation results provide a reference for the application of cross-chain technology in energy interconnection.}

The underlying technology – blockchain and distributed ledger technology – was posed as a technological solution to the problems of trust, confidence, transparency and behaviour traditionally addressed in finance through a framework of law, regulation and institutions (including markets and the state). Cryptocurrencies, blockchain, distributed ledger technology and decentralised finance were designed to address the weaknesses and risks in traditional finance. Yet fifteen years of evolution culminating in the Crypto Winter of 2022–23 have demonstrated that crypto is neither special nor immune and has come to feature all the classic problems of traditional finance. As the crypto ecosystem has evolved, the market failures and externalities of traditional finance have emerged – a process we term the ‘financialisation’ of crypto. These include conflicts of interests, information asymmetries, centralisation and interconnections, over-enthusiastic market participants, plus agency, operational and financial risks. We argue that (a) in order to develop successfully going forward, the crypto ecosystem needs to assimilate the centuries of experience of underpinning traditional finance with law and regulation, and (b) in the aftermath of the Crypto Winter, an international consensus is crystalising in respect of the regulation of the crypto ecosystem. We argue regulatory systems are now being instituted to ensure the proper functioning of crypto and its interconnections with traditional finance. The lessons of the financialisation of crypto also apply more broadly: appropriately designed regulatory systems are central to financial market functioning and development.}

Digital forensics is an extravagant need to detect cyber attacks and to identify cybercriminals.

Hence, the need for a secure and lightweight cryptosystem arises to protect it from cyber-attacks. In the present paper, authors aim to design a novel forensic framework for digital evidence administration using advanced encryption and preservation mechanisms. Authors focus to encrypt and preserve only digital image evidence but can be deployed on other types of multimedia data like video frames. Three types of Chaos-map algorithms namely 4D hyperchaotic map, 2D Arnold Cat map (ACM) and Henon Map have been utilized to encrypty and decrypt digital image evidence which enable high sensitivity and dependency on initial conditions, quasi-randomness, and ergodicity to digital content. The proposed approaches have been analyzed on different groups of images of different size and validated using various security parameters such as unified average changing intensity (UACI), correlation coefficient, and the number of pixels changing rate (NPCR). Image transformation and compression has been performed after encryption process using Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). The proposed work has been analyzed using histogram and auto-correlation. Experimentations have provided the values of the correlation coefficient of plain images near 1 and the value of adjacent cipher images near zero which show a strong correlation. The evaluated results for UACI are more than 33 % for every considered images. The value for NPCR should be near 100 % and here the calculated results for each image are above 99 %. The complexity of the proposed encryption algorithm is O(n) due to key generation using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG). The compressed and transformed image evidence have been stored into decentralized blockchain to ensure the integrity and confidentiality. Decentralized blockchain has been used as a reliable and promising solution to preserve digital evidence due to its distinct features like secure peer to peer communication, improved trust and transparency among participants, integrity, confidentiality, immutability, without risk of single point-of-failure. The proposed digital forensic model is able to prevent various threats and security challenges which can contaminate or tamper off digital pieces of evidence and assures improved digital evidence administration and defensibility. In the proposed scheme, the encryption process takes only 2–3 s to perform the encryption of each size of image.}

abstract = {With the Digital Financial package (MiCA, DLT Pilot, and DORA, later on complemented by the DAC8 proposal) the European Union seeks to establish an appropriate legal framework for crypto-assets showing a financial nature. The package represents a first attempt to regulate a complex and emerging phenomenon, characterised by significant trade-offs. Unsurprisingly, in this early stage of the law-making process several relevant aspects of the crypto environment remain unaddressed, such as pure DeFI models, DAOs, and NFTs. Such regulatory gap is to a large extent attributable to the difficulty of addressing technologically complex issues through command-and-control top-down legislation. The improvements delivered by the Better Regulation Agenda are not enough to solve this conundrum. In this context, the Communication by the Bank of Italy on Decentralised Technology in Finance and Crypto-assets and its first move, the smart-contract MoU, provide an interesting case study to discuss the potential of ‘participatory regulation.’ This experimental form of regulation tries to get the most out of co-regulation, self-regulation, and command-and-control, combining their characters with the view of reconciling the technology neutrality principle with technology-based regulation. Participatory regulation aims to bridge the public and private sector in order to strike a right balance between flexibility and legal certainty, without stifling innovation.}

While an increasing number of pilot projects have been exploring DeFi applications for use by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in various finance scenarios, there is not yet a real-world adoption of DeFi beyond these projects to unlock their potential for progressing the digitisation of supply chain finance (SCF). This paper reports on a university-industry collaborative study to leverage the use of blockchain-based DeFi technology in two ways: (i) to benefit SMEs by reducing their cost of finance and increasing ease of access to funding, and; (ii) to address the prevalent asymmetric information risks and costs in a supply chain finance context. The research informed the design and development of a DeFi architecture for asset tracking in agricultural supply chains implemented and evaluated in a real-world pilot adoption with a producer in the Australian livestock industry. The use case shows that there are numerous risks pertaining to the adoption of DeFi for SCF. In response, the paper suggests new ways for supply chain SMEs to secure benefits from their investment in DeFi based on the key findings derived from evaluating our use cases.}

The Bisq Trade Protocol systematises the peer-to-peer trading of Bitcoin for other currencies and the Bisq DAO decentralises the governance and finance functions of the entire exchange. However, by following the Bisq Trade Protocol and interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use novel address clustering heuristics to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We describe address clustering heuristics for both the Bisq Trade Protocol and the Bisq DAO. We show that the heuristics aggregate activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.}

The alternative finance industry leverages innovative technologies, such as direct lending, crowdfunding, automated wealth management, on-demand insurance, and digital currencies. This feature aligns well with the DeFi principles, and it is also beneficial to CeFi. Distributed ledger platforms offer transparency and security for both DeFi and CeFi, whereas future payment technologies provide user-friendly solutions. This study applies novel wavelet and quantile cross-spectral coherence analyses to obtain nuanced relationship insights. This methodology categorizes crypto finance into the DeFi and broader cryptocurrency ecosystems to facilitate robust comparison with traditional banking. It further delineates democratized banking into alternative financing mechanisms, distributed ledger technologies, and future payment capabilities. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals time–frequency associations, whereas quantile cross-spectral coherence unveils extreme connections under different market conditions. The findings suggest the existence of dynamic relationships between inclusive banking components and various financial infrastructures. These relationships vary across return distributions and time scales. In regular markets, positive associations are seen in yearly and monthly frequency cycles with alternative finance and centralized services exhibiting the strongest linkage. During periods of extremely high returns, CeFi and centralized-decentralized (hybrid) infrastructures exhibit limited interconnectivity with democratized banking. Moreover, DeFi's association with distributed ledger technology is negligible. In bear markets, the strongest positive associations are observed between inclusive access and conventional, hybrid, and decentralized financial systems. These insights provide new perspectives on the dynamics between financial systems during extreme conditions. This study emphasizes the need for adaptive regulation, international cooperation, and a balance between innovation and stability to protect and empower users. Collaboration between academia and policymakers is essential to navigate this evolving landscape and advance democratized banking.}

abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.}

abstract = {In recent years, the Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0 came into being. With the development of modern industrial intelligent manufacturing technology, digital twins, Web3 and many other digital entity applications are also proposed. These applications apply architectures such as distributed learning, resource sharing, and arithmetic trading, which make high demands on identity authentication, asset authentication, resource addressing, and service location. Therefore, an efficient, secure, and trustworthy Industrial Internet identity resolution system is needed. However, most of the traditional identity resolution systems follow DNS architecture or tree structure, which has the risk of a single point of failure and DDoS attack. And they cannot guarantee the security and privacy of digital identity, personal assets, and device information. So we consider a decentralized approach for identity management, identity authentication, and asset verification. In this paper, we propose a distributed trusted active identity resolution system based on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) and non-fungible token (NFT), which can provide distributed identity resolution services. And we have designed the system architecture, identity service process, load balancing strategy and smart contract service. In addition, we use Jmeter to verify the performance of the system, and the results show that the system has good high concurrent performance and robustness.}

Besides, the AmI-IoT has improved patient engagement and gratification as doctors’ interactions have become more comfortable and efficient. However, the benefits of the AmI-IoT-based healthcare applications are not availed entirely due to the adversarial threats. IoT networks are prone to cyber attacks due to vulnerable wireless mediums and the absentia of lightweight and robust security protocols. This paper introduces computationally-inexpensive privacy-assuring authentication protocol for AmI-IoT healthcare applications. The use of blockchain & fog computing in the protocol guarantees unforgeability, non-repudiation, transparency, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. The protocol uses physically unclonable functions (PUF), biometrics, and Ethereum powered smart contracts to prevent replay, impersonation, and cloning attacks. Results prove the resource efficiency of the protocol as the smart contract incurs very minimal gas and transaction fees. The Scyther results validate the robustness of the proposed protocol against cyber-attacks. The protocol applies lightweight cryptography primitives (Hash, PUF) instead of conventional public-key cryptography and scalar multiplications. Consequently, the proposed protocol is better than centralized infrastructure-based authentication approaches.}

In this work we formalize a linearizable Byzantine-tolerant Distributed Ledger Object (BDLO), which is a linearizable DLO where clients and servers processes may deviate arbitrarily from their intended behavior (i.e. they may be Byzantine). The proposed formal definition is accompanied by algorithms that implement BDLOs on top of an underlying Byzantine Atomic Broadcast service. Then we develop a suite of algorithms, based on the previous BDLO implementations, that solve the Atomic Appends problem in the presence of asynchrony, Byzantine clients and Byzantine servers. This problem occurs when clients have a composite record (set of basic records) to append to different BDLOs, in such a way that either each basic record is appended to its BDLO (and this must occur in good circumstances), or no basic record is appended. Distributed algorithms are presented, which solve the Atomic Appends problem when the clients (involved in the Atomic Appends) and the servers (which maintain the BDLOs) may be Byzantine. Finally we provide proof of concept implementations and an experimental evaluation of the presented algorithms.}

A large inflow of newcomers or inexperienced investors can serve as a trigger of herding. Herding in the NFT market tends to arise when the return on Ethereum increases, but it tends to diminish as the return on Bitcoin increases. Meanwhile, unlike in traditional asset markets, herding in NFT markets does not appear to happen across submarkets (OpenSea, Atomic, Cryptokitties, Godsunchained, and Decentraland). Active investors herd to trade NFTs within different collections and follow the market consensus when they are making investment decisions on NFTs listed on OpenSea. Results from macro- and micro-approaches validate and complement one another, plotting a profile on how investors herd in the NFT market.}

Auction is an effective method of distributing goods to the bidder with the highest valuation. Hence, the use of auction strategy can not only guarantee the interests of data sellers, but also conform to market principles. However, existing data auction mechanisms are centralized. It is hard to build trust among sellers, buyers and auctioneers. An open and anonymous online environment may cause entities involved in data auctions to collude to manipulate the results of data auctions. This will cause the price of auction data to fail to reach a fair and truthful level. Therefore, the first anti-collusion data auction mechanism based on smart contract is proposed. Through a well-designed anti-collusion data auction algorithm, mutual distrust and rational buyers and sellers safely participate in the data auction without a trusted third party. The data auction mechanism designed in the smart contract can effectively prevent collusion and realize the fairness and truthfulness of data auction. The webpack in the Truffle Boxes is used to implement the data auction mechanism, and the anti-collusion property of the mechanism has been verified. The source code of the smart contract has been uploaded to GitHub.}

Despite the benefits that IoT technology brings to individuals, society, and industry, this technology faces a critical challenge in controlling access to various resources in IoT environments. To address this challenge, we propose Combo-Chain, an blockchain-based access control system deeply rooted in the concepts of the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model, smart contracts, and sharding. Combo-Chain introduces the concept of hierarchy for both subject attributes and object attributes to enhance flexibility and dynamicity when specifying ABAC policies, simplifying policy and attribute management. It not only manages access policies but also attributes by deploying a set of smart contracts. Furthermore, Combo-Chain utilizes sharding technique to distribute the overhead associated with storing and managing both access policies and attributes. Sharding also helps Combo-Chain to distribute the computational overhead when evaluating access requests among two groups of nodes, addressing the issues of low scalability and poor performance often associated with blockchain technology. Combo-Chain is implemented on a private Ethereum platform, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Combo-Chain compared to existing blockchain-based access control systems.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the vast majority of Internet services used to distribute hypermedia content follow a centralized model, which is highly dependent on servers and raises several quality and security concerns. Among other issues, this centralized model creates single points of failure, requires trust on providers to avoid censorship and personal data misuse, and results in a scenario where digital content tends to disappear or be inaccessible over time, for example, when a content creator stops maintaining a site or when the content is moved to another location. To improve this, it is necessary to replicate data and follow more distributed models. Nevertheless, current platforms to distribute content in this way, either do not offer an effective mechanism to maintain the privacy of their users or they offer full-anonymity, which contributes to the dissemination of content that goes beyond the law and moral standards of many users. This paper proposes a novel distributed architecture that enables hypermedia resource distribution ensuring censorship resistance and conditional k-anonymity. In the proposed system, users form groups to share hypermedia content where the anonymity of the publisher is preserved only if the publication follows a set of rules defined by the group. To this end, the proposed system uses threshold discernible ring signatures to enable conditional k-anonymity, the Ethereum blockchain platform to manage groups and user identities, and the InterPlanetary File System to store and share hypermedia resources in a distributed way. This document provides the design for the proposed architecture and protocols, it evaluates system risks and its security properties, and it discusses the proposal in general terms.}

abstract = {In this paper we introduce IoTPatchPool — a novel scheme that enables an incentivized distributed delivery network of IoT software updates. We use a decentralized storage network for reducing the load on the vendor when distributing patches toward IoT devices, and eliminating central points of failure. Unlike existing peer-to-peer file sharing networks which have a fundamental availability problem for unpopular files, our protocol utilizes blockchain-based smart contracts to incentivize independent peers, termed distributors, by means of cryptocurrency payments. A vendor of IoT devices deploys a smart contract with a deposit, which acts as a publicly verifiable binding bid for delivery of patches to a specific set of IoT endpoints. Distributors will compete for delivering the updates to the desired IoT devices and present proofs-of-distribution in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. We address the fair exchange problem between distributors and the consuming IoT devices by utilizing a variation of the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) protocol, ensuring that the process is trustless. This can encourage the participation of a large number of distributors, and thus facilitate a rapid scale-out of the system. Finally, we present and evaluate a prototype implementation combining the BitTorrent network with the cryptocurrency Ethereum.}

Recently, prosumers, both consumers and producers, emerge with the increasing affordability to invest in domestic solar systems. Prosumers may trade within their communities to better manage their demand and supply as well as providing social and economic benefits. In this paper, we explore the use of Blockchain technologies and auction mechanisms to facilitate autonomous peer-to-peer energy trading within microgrids. We design two frameworks that utilize the smart contract functionality in Ethereum and employ the continuous double auction and uniform-price double-sided auction mechanisms, respectively. We validate our design by conducting A/B tests to compare the performance of different frameworks on a real-world dataset. The key characteristics of the two frameworks and several cost analyses are presented for comparison. Our results demonstrate that a P2P trading platform that integrates the blockchain technologies and agent-based systems is promising to complement the current centralized energy grid. We also identify a number of limitations, alternative solutions, and directions for future work.}

This phenomenon is defining a new economy staging in so-called metaverses. Here, physical-world BMs are modified, virtual-world BMs are implemented, and combinations of physical-world and virtual-world BMs are performed. As a result, new mechanisms of value creation and value capture at the crossroads of physical and virtual economies arise in the metaverse. This paper aims at understanding which are these value mechanisms and how organizations can develop them. To this aim, the paper analyzes the cases of four cross-industry incumbents (namely, Gucci, Samsung, Hyundai, and Nike), which are pivoting their BMs in the metaverse. A framework indicating how to innovate BMs in the metaverse is provided, by looking at both “phygital” transformations (i.e., transformations aimed at joining physical and digital worlds’ realities) and completely virtual immersions shaping firms’ internal processes and relationships with customers. In this way, the paper supports companies in turning the metaverse into value, while also extends the scant academic knowledge on the metaverse’ impact on innovation of BMs.}

We argue that digital twins of IoT devices, with the right design, can enhance the security, reliability, auditability, and interoperability of IoT systems. The salient features of digital twins have made them key elements for the IoT and Industry 4.0. In this paper, we leverage advances in W3C's Web of Things (WoT) standards and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to present a novel design of the smart contract-based digital twins with enhanced security, transparency, interoperability, and reliability. We provide two different variations of that general design using two different blockchains (one public and one private, permissioned blockchain), and we present design trade-offs. Furthermore, we introduce an architecture for accessing and controlling IoT devices securely and reliably, providing full auditability, while at the same time using the proposed digital twins as an indirection mechanism (proxy). The proposed architecture leverages the blockchain to offer notable properties, namely,decentralization, immutability, auditability, non-repudiation, availability, and reliability. Moreover, it introduces mass actuation, easier management of IoT devices, and enhanced security to the IoT gateways, enables new business models, and makes consumer devices (vendor-)agnostic.}

Nonetheless, there are many concerns regarding the security, privacy, and anonymity of the mHealth transactions. Conventionally, privacy includes anonymity, untraceability, unlinkability, unforgeability, and confidentiality. Transactions’ confidentiality can be easily protected using confidential transaction techniques. However, anonymity, untraceability, unlinkability, and unforgeability properties are quite challenging issues in healthcare transactions. This paper proposes a UDP-based anonymous protocol for mHealth transactions to protect the security of data and privacy of clients’ identities. In this work, we aim to investigate utilizing one of the best anonymity solutions, onion structure (onion encryption, onion routing, and onion network), with blockchain smart contracts upon the UDP platform to make a protocol for transferring data in IoT-based mHealth applications. In the proposed protocol, every malicious client who sends false data can be easily detected using an identity disclosure process. In this way, mHealth clients, without exchanging sensitive identities, can establish an authorized connection and be protected against different kinds of attacks. According to our experimental results and security/privacy proofs, the proposed protocol has an acceptable computational cost and security protections for IoT-based mHealth transactions.}

With a projected market of $800 billion by 2024, the metaverse is expected to radically reshape retailing in the digital world. However, very little is known about the metaverse from a customer, retailer, or brand perspective. This article summarizes how the metaverse has been conceptualized thus far in the literature and the popular press. The authors offer a new conceptualization of the metaverse that contains four distinct dimensions: online collaboration, high consumer immersion, unique digital assets, and digital personas. Considering that the technologies currently used to provide high consumer immersion (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality) and unique digital assets (e.g., blockchain technology) are not fully developed or commercialized, the authors also propose the concept of a transitory metaverse to understand the current stage of metaverse development better. The authors conclude by providing 27 directions for future research based on a full factorial of how the metaverse dimensions amplify three customer touchpoints in the digital experience (digital economic exchange, complex social relationships, direct environment interaction) for the three main stakeholders of any retailing exchange (consumers, retailers, brands) along the entire customer journey (pre-purchase, purchase, post-purchase).}

However, little effort has been devoted toward investigating the large amount of trade data recorded in blockchains. This paper focuses on transaction data in Ethereum, which is a prominent public blockchain platform supporting not only secure cryptocurrency transfer but also various decentralized applications. By means of the framework of network science theory, we find that several transaction features, such as transaction volume, transaction relation, and component structure, exhibit a heavy-tailed property and can be approximated by the power law function. In particular, we find that the transaction relations follow a bow-tie structure with negative assortativity if they are regarded as a directed graph. The popular hubs tend to connect to a large number of common users. We believe that the aforementioned statistics can be ascribed to the vast diversity of transactions and the existence of a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to not only carry out a relatively comprehensive investigation of the transaction data recorded in Ethereum but also probe the statistical laws underlying the transaction relationships from the perspective of network science.}

This Article then uses the framework of “accommodating, taming, or coping” to assess some extant fintech regulatory strategies in light of how they respond to the public harm arising from some fintech business models (particularly crypto business models). This Article is critical of regulatory strategies designed to peel back existing protective regulation to accommodate private sector fintech innovation; instead, it advocates for a taming approach but recognizes that, in practice, protective regulatory responses can more accurately be described as coping.

abstract = {Smart contracts are widely used on the blockchain to implement complex transactions, such as decentralized applications on Ethereum. Effective vulnerability detection of large-scale smart contracts is critical, as attacks on smart contracts often cause huge economic losses. Since it is difficult to repair and update smart contracts, it is necessary to find the vulnerabilities before they are deployed. However, code analysis, which requires traversal paths, and learning methods, which require many features to be trained, are too time-consuming to detect large-scale on-chain contracts. Learning-based methods will obtain detection models from a feature space compared to code analysis methods such as symbol execution. But the existing features lack the interpretability of the detection results and training model, even worse, the large-scale feature space also affects the efficiency of detection. This paper focuses on improving the detection efficiency by reducing the dimension of the features, combined with expert knowledge. In this paper, a feature extraction model Block-gram is proposed to form low-dimensional knowledge-based features from bytecode. First, the metadata is separated and the runtime code is converted into a sequence of opcodes, which are divided into segments based on some instructions (jumps, etc.). Then, scalable Block-gram features, including 4-dimensional block features and 8-dimensional attribute features, are mined for the learning-based model training. Finally, feature contributions are calculated from SHAP values to measure the relationship between our features and the results of the detection model. In addition, six types of vulnerability labels are made on a dataset containing 33,885 contracts, and these knowledge-based features are evaluated using seven state-of-the-art learning algorithms, which show that the average detection latency speeds up 25× to 650×, compared with the features extracted by N-gram, and also can enhance the interpretability of the detection model.}

Based on an integrative review of literature on tokenization, blockchain and the circular economy and multiple case studies in the agri-food domain, we show the relevance of tokenization to the circular economy in three ways: 1) enhancing traceability of physical and digital objects in supply chains; 2) improving transparency and credibility of circularity claims; 3) facilitating collaborative business ecosystems with incentives for more circular production and distribution.

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies and blockchain have become a global phenomenon, transforming people's relationships with technology and offering innovative tools for businesses and individuals to strive in a digital age. However, little is still known about the main drivers of cryptocurrency ownership, especially in emerging markets. Based on a representative online survey among 573 Brazilian digital platform investors, we find that crypto investors tend to be young, male, more tolerant to risk, less optimistic in their economic views, and consider themselves as ‘better’ investors compared to non-crypto online traders. While crypto and non-crypto investors have similar edu-cational backgrounds, our results show that cryptocurrency literacy positively and strongly relates to cryptocurrency ownership and intentions to invest in cryptocurrency. A gender gap among cryptocurrency investors has been confirmed. The findings further suggest that sophisticated in-vestors are more likely to hedge pessimistic economic expectations using cryptocurrency than their unsophisticated peers. We also find significant heterogeneity among cryptocurrency investors (e.g., early x late adopters) on attitudes and beliefs. The insights into digital investors' intentions to invest in cryptocurrency can be valuable for policymakers in designing strategies for the broader adoption of digital assets in the era of a decentralized economy, considering the planned adoption of CBDC in Brazil.}

We follow the existing literature in differentiating between disclosures associated with vague future intentions or plans to adopt Metaverse activity (“Vague”), and announcements concerning actual activities related to the Metaverse infrastructure (“Clear”). Clear disclosures are associated with higher abnormal returns, in contrast to Vague ones leading to a milder response by investors in the days surrounding the disclosure. Early adopters and large-cap firms earn higher abnormal returns immediately following Metaverse disclosures than do late adopters and small-cap companies. Although the Metaverse may represent a potential growth engine for firms in the future, we document a short-term positive overreaction in share price behavior that is completely reversed within the 30 days following the announcements, regardless of the size of companies, the timing of the disclosure, or whether the disclosure was Clear or Vague.}

In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) maintains users’ assets by smart contracts in a decentralized manner, but introduces additional overhead in terms of gas fee and transaction confirmation latency. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the benefits of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is criticized for two issues. First, trading transactions are time-consuming and expensive for frequent token traders. Second, excessive simultaneous transactions might cause the pending transaction congestion in the Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate the pending transaction congestion. Besides, we propose the very first gas-price vs. transaction-confirmation-latency function to guide Ethereum transaction issuers to choose an optimal gas price that minimizes the overall cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the cost in the proposed HEX with that in the conventional HEX. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing gas fees and transaction confirmation latency for frequent traders as well as the pending transaction congestion in Ethereum.}

abstract = {With the increasing acceptance and utilization of blockchain technology, a multitude of blockchain-based systems have emerged. Consequently, the need for interoperability among these systems has become paramount, particularly in a trustless manner. To enable decentralized and secure cross-chain applications for users, the establishment of a trust-minimized interoperability solution is imperative for homogeneous blockchain-based networks. This paper presents an analysis of the current state and challenges associated with interoperability between blockchain-based systems. Building upon previous research, we propose that the set of blockchain-based networks should be narrowed down based on the same settlement layer for supporting trust-minimized interoperability. Specifically, we concentrate on the cross-rollup functionality between rollups. We have devised and implemented two similar solutions to address the aforementioned interoperability problem, employing a trust-minimized optimistic approach. Through extensive experimentation, we compare our proposed solutions with existing cross-rollup bridges in terms of gas consumption, time complexity, and newly introduced trust assumptions. Our experimental investigations concentrate on the transmission of arbitrary data utilizing non-fungible tokens. The results reveal that one of our proposed solutions offers an optimal approach for cross-rollup communication between optimistic rollups.}

abstract = {Smart contracts (SC) run on blockchain technology (BCT) to implement agreements between several parties. As BCT grows, organizations aim to automate their processes and engage in business collaborations using SCs. The translation of contract semantics into SC language semantics is difficult due to ambiguous contractual interpretation by the several parties and the developers. Also, an SC language itself misses the language constructs needed for semantically expressing collaboration terms. This leads to SC coding errors that result in contractual conflicts over transactions during the performance of SCs and thus, novel SC solutions incur high development and maintenance costs. Various model-based and no/low code development approaches address this issue by enabling higher abstractions in SC development. Still, the question remains unanswered how contractual parties, i.e., end-users with non-IT skills, manage to develop legally relevant SCs with ease. This study aims to (1) identify and categorize the state of the art of SC automation models, in terms of their technical features, and their legal significance, and to (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a systematic literature review (SLR) that follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham for performing SLRs in software-engineering. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 1367 papers are collected, and 33 of them are selected for extraction and analysis. The contributions of this article are threefold: (1) 10 different SC automation models/frameworks are identified and classified according to their technical and implementation features; (2) 11 different legal contract parameters are identified and categorized into 4 legal criteria classes; (3) a comparative analysis of SC-automation models in the context of their legal significance is conducted that identifies the degrees to which the SC-automation models are considered legally relevant. As a conclusion, we produce a comprehensive and replicable overview of the state of the art of SC automation models and a systematic measure of their legal significance to benefit practitioners in the field.}

In this paper a novel smart contract payment security system named SMTSEC is presented for eliminating or reducing payment issues in the construction sector. The SMTSEC ensures security of payment of construction contracts through an automated computerized protocol that runs on a decentralized blockchain. The potential contributions and limitations of the proposed SMTSEC are studied through a real construction project. The main contribution of the SMTSEC is that it provides a new method for timely and transparent payment of construction projects by guaranteeing security of payment for works under construction without requiring administrative costs and burdens of trusted intermediaries such as lawyers or banks.}

abstract = {Programming errors in Ethereum smart contracts can result in catastrophic financial losses from stolen cryptocurrency. While vulnerability detectors can prevent vulnerable contracts from being deployed, this does not mean that such contracts will not be deployed. Once a vulnerable contract is instantiated on the blockchain and becomes the target of attacks, the identification of exploit transactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually exploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved. In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum attacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoC) specially crafted for use in the blockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful exploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a model for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that mirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we compare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their effectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for investigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that coarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit transactions with less computation. However, they are contract-specific and suffer from false negatives. On the other hand, fine-grained IoCs defined over virtual machine instructions can avoid these pitfalls at the expense of increased computation, which is nevertheless applicable for practical use.}

abstract = {The emergence of on-demand service provisioning by Federated Cloud Providers (FCPs) to Cloud Users (CU) has fuelled significant innovations in cloud provisioning models. Owing to the massive traffic, massive CU resource requests are sent to FCPs, and appropriate service recommendations are sent by FCPs. Currently, the Fourth-Generation (4G)-Long Term Evolution (LTE) network faces bottlenecks that affect end-user throughput and latency. Moreover, the data is exchanged among heterogeneous stakeholders, and thus trust is a prime concern. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a Blockchain (BC)-leveraged rank-based recommender scheme, FedRec, to expedite secure and trusted Cloud Service Provisioning (CSP) to the CU through the FCP at the backdrop of base 5G communication service. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a BC-integrated request-response broker model is formulated between the CU, Cloud Brokers (BR), and the FCP, where a CU service request is forwarded through the BR to different FCPs. For service requests, Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) is supported by 5G-enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service. In the next phase, a weighted matching recommender model is proposed at the FCP sites based on a novel Ranking-Based Recommender (RBR) model based on the CU requests. In the final phase, based on the matching recommendations between the CU and the FCP, Smart Contracts (SC) are executed, and resource provisioning data is stored in the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS) that expedite the block validations. The proposed scheme FedRec is compared in terms of SC evaluation and formal verification. In simulation, FedRec achieves a reduction of 27.55% in chain storage and a transaction throughput of 43.5074 Mbps at 150 blocks. For the IPFS, we have achieved a bandwidth improvement of 17.91%. In the RBR models, the maximum obtained hit ratio is 0.9314 ​at 200 million CU requests, showing an improvement of 1.2% in average servicing latency over non-RBR models and a maximization trade-off of QoE index of 2.7688 at the flow request 1.088 and at granted service price of USD 1.559 million to FCP for provided services. The obtained results indicate the viability of the proposed scheme against traditional approaches.}

The concept originated initially as a token standard of Ethereum, an open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, where each token is characterized by distinguishable signs. These types of tokens have unique digital properties that allow their distinct identification. NFTs, with their distinct qualities, can be fluidly traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, and liquidity. The trading of NFTs has heavily influenced the growth of the decentralized application (dApp) marketplace, as exponential returns (thousand folds from their original value) on its ever-expanding market are being observed, leading to worldwide attention. However, the NFT ecosystem is in its nascence, and the associated technologies are still in their infancy. New researchers might be fascinated with the exponential, yet nebulous evolution of NFTs; however, this novelty has contributed to the paucity of systematic and conclusive published research work on this topic. This review portrays the NFT ecosystem multidimensionally, wherein the paper commences with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT technology and furnishes summary standards and desired properties. Finally, the study concludes with an elaborate discussion of the future outlook for and prime challenges faced by NFTs.}
