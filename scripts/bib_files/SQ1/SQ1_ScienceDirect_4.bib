abstract = {Blockchain technology has a great potential for improving efficiency, security and privacy of Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing systems. However, existing solutions relying on a centralized database are susceptible to traditional security problems such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and a single point of failure similar to traditional database systems. In addition, past solutions exposed users to privacy linking attacks and did not tackle performance and scalability challenges. In this paper, we propose a permissioned Blockchain based healthcare data sharing system that integrates Blockchain technology, decentralized file system and threshold signature to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed system is based on Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus algorithm and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). We implemented the proposed system on an enterprise Ethereum Blockchain known as Hyperledger Besu. We evaluated and compared the performance of the proposed system based on various performance metrics such as transaction latency, throughput and failure rate. Experiments were conducted on a variable network size and number of transactions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than existing Blockchain based systems. Moreover, the decentralized file system provides better security than existing traditional centralized database systems while providing the same level of performance.}

abstract = {With the progressive increase in the use of disruptive technology in healthcare services, diversified solutions are being worked upon to make medical services patient-friendly and secure. In general, patient personal details and medical history are rigorously maintained in electronic health records. The data are sensitive and must be secured. Often data must be shared to obtain a second expert opinion and alternative solutions. This potentially increases data exposure, thereby risking breaches and unauthorized access. The blockchain architecture has immense potential to securely communicate and transform health, clinical, medical, and life science service delivery as required by healthcare applications in an immutable and decentralized manner. Blockchain innovation has caught the interest of health experts and biomedical researchers in different areas of medical care such as longitudinal clinical records, drug advancement, automated complaints, interoperability in people’s health, clinical exploration, patient portals, information security, and supply chain management system. It is being considered whether blockchain-integrated healthcare will disturb the flow of medical services. Still, medical associations are keenly observing its potential for ideas such as secure patient identification. Blockchain with features such as decentralized networks and tamper-proof platforms makes it an ideal technology to be investigated for its prospects in healthcare. This chapter provides an in-depth examination of the different intricacies of the blockchain in the healthcare sector, particularly with the 4.0 edition. The chapter also presents various techniques for secured transaction and validation methods of healthcare data that are evolving rapidly. Factors enhancing patient interoperability with the blockchain structure focusing on state-of-the-art security and privacy aspects have been addressed in the work. In addition, the work also presents a case study with already-existing electronic healthcare support application with online assistance and data accumulation at a cloud-based service to reduce the physical work done by patients, work also enumerates open issues, and challenges with the technology suggested.}

From a brand perspective, NFTs can be seen as representations of the brand components, such as the product, the logo, or the image. I argue that NFTs have immense potential to become standalone brand assets. I illustrate how this can be achieved by relating the brand's NFT strategies to the marketing funnel stages. Brands can turn into an NFT their physical products such as shoes, shirts, or art to attract brand awareness, generate cross-selling opportunities, and spark stronger perceived ownership of certain brand elements. Importantly, NFTs can allow brands to form a highly engaging brand community that can support the brand, blend online and offline product ownership, and potentially create a bond between the brand and consumers. These exciting possibilities generate a rich research agenda I present in this paper.}

Blockchain is a combination of blocks of transactions that are validated and verified by the process of consensus. Organizations and businesses can use it for cost-cutting, security, and decentralization. Because of its decentralized structure, the blockchain is extremely safe, as there is no single point of failure. We will focus on blockchain architecture and security concerns in this chapter, including decentralization, mining, consensus, smart contracts, and more.

DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.}

The model was tested using data collected from 100 educators located in different countries from worldwide. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), Random Forest and other different feature importance methods, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), thematic content analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The application of PLS-SEM outlines that immersive platform features and safe learning environments positively affects educational outcomes. Random Forest and feature importance methods investigate the predictive power of items included in the model, fsQCA reveals the combinations of these factors that lead to high educational outcomes, while the qualitative insights reveal the key themes emerged from educators’ perspectives on the use of Metaverse platforms.

Such phenomenon is known as the Verifier's Dilemma that the search results of the blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme would be claimed to have been verified but devoid of valid verification. Besides, the top-k query technique utilized by most existing searchable encryption schemes fails to filter the search results from the user demands during retrieval, which results in massive ineffective access lists with high complexity. Aiming at the two problems, we present a blockchain-based multi-keyword ranked searchable encryption scheme and design a fair payment protocol for multi-user scenarios. Our scheme may achieve public verifiability and user fairness by leveraging the TrueBit network, while the data owner (DO) can withdraw search privileges from the authorized data user (DU). Also, we extend the searchable encryption scheme based on inverted index to multi-DO/multi-DU scenarios, and the HashMap index is used to diminish the response time and space complexity. Moreover, the proposed scheme supports the update of index keywords and files dynamically. To enhance retrieval accuracy, we modify the information divergence algorithm in machine learning and utilize the monotonically weighted aggregation function, which improves retrieval accuracy to around 97%. Finally, Security analysis illustrates correctness and resilience against typical attacks to verify the robustness and utility of the proposed scheme.}

Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).}

abstract = {A data marketplace provides a platform for data trading by bringing together data owners and data consumers with a data broker. Recent advancements in mechanism design of data marketplaces have introduced a number of private data query mechanisms that facilitate the trading of private data. A critical assumption to ensuring that these mechanisms function as intended in a real-world online platform, which is often overlooked in the mechanism design literature, is that they are implemented in a network infrastructure that guarantees secure and fair trade. Such a network infrastructure should allow data storage, communications and transactions to satisfy confidentiality, data integrity, fair brokerage, and privacy requirements. In this paper, we propose SmartAuction, the first blockchain-based secure implementation of a private data query system. SmartAuction utilises a public-key encryption scheme, a digital signature scheme and two smart contracts to facilitate the four tasks of a data trade: data submission, data request, auction and query, and payment and delivery. Using universal composability (UC) framework, we verify that SmartAuction satisfies the desirable properties mentioned above. We also conduct experiment to show that SmartAuction can be implemented in real Ethereum platforms and it has a broad applicability.}

Traceability enables verifying signals’ history for security or analytical purposes. On the other hand, the autonomous execution of pre-defined rules establishes trust between parties involved in such applications and improves the efficiency of their workflow. Smart Contracts (SCs) firmly guarantee these two requirements due to the blockchain’s immutable distributed ledger and secure cryptographic consensus rules. Thus, SCs emerged as an appealing technology for monitoring applications. However, the cost of using public blockchains to harvest these guarantees can be prohibitive, especially with the considerable fluctuation of coin prices and different use case requirements. In this paper, we introduce a general SC-based IoT monitoring framework that can leverage the security features of public blockchains while minimizing the corresponding monetary cost. The framework contains a reinforcement learning agent that adapts to users’ needs and acts in real-time to smartly set the data submission rate of IoT sensors. Results based on the Ethereum protocol show significant potential cost saving depending on users’ preferences.}

As the demand for data sharing has increased, a new business model of data marketplace has emerged that allows individuals to sell their data to buyers for monetary gain. However, these data marketplaces are prone to various threats such as unauthorized data redistribution/reselling, tampering of data, dishonest data ownership claims, and trade of bogus data. The existing solutions related to data ownership traceability are unable to address the above issues due to ambiguous data ownership, undisclosed data reselling, and dispersal of data ownership across multiple marketplaces. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a novel blockchain framework, TrailChain, that uses watermarking to generate a trusted trade trail for tracking the data ownership spanning across multiple decentralized marketplaces. Our solution includes mechanisms for detecting any unauthorized data reselling within and across marketplaces. We also propose a fair resell payment sharing scheme that ensures the resell revenue is shared with the data owners over authorized reselling. We present a prototype implementation of the system using Ethereum. We perform extensive simulations to demonstrate TrailChain’s feasibility by benchmarking performance metrics including execution gas costs, execution time, latency and throughput.}

This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic –the smart contracts– and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.}

In cases where patients are not physically present in clinics or hospitals, healthcare providers produce observations systems that diagnose and prescribe treatment.

As a result of the implementation of blockchain-based characteristics (e.g. distributed ledger, decentralized storage, and authentication), healthcare systems can be enhanced. Accordingly, smart contracts are applied for the achievement of more authentication and sharing of records, and requirements for participants automatically. As the number of users or other components increases, blockchains and smart contracts should be able to provide quality service. Technically, smart contracts using blockchains have several challenges that are important, such as scalability, enhanced security, and optimal performance. There is still a question about the scalability of blockchain as there is a significant amount of computational power needed to scale up with a high number of participants in healthcare systems.

A classification of the applications of blockchain technology in the scope of operations and supply chain management is presented. In order to demonstrate the technical architecture of the blockchain-based logistics monitoring system (BLMS), a reference implementation was programmed and tested based on Ethereum. The purpose of the BLMS is to provide a solution for parcel tracking in a supply chain to support an open and immutable history record for each transaction. The functionality of the system consists of transaction entry for logistics operators.

While blockchain technologies provide a helpful mechanism in the form of technical consensus, originally created to resolve the double-spending problem, little does it address impediments to proper contract formation that have to do with the quality of exogenous data, asymmetry of information, or even its suitability (the colloquial garbage-in/garbage-out problem). In the face of the limitations of technical consensus, we explore how the strengths of technical consensus can be utilized by introducing another dimension of consensus – what we have called social consensus – which directly addresses the formation of true (if retrospective) Common Knowledge essential to arms-length agreement between multiple actors. We have eschewed the notion that social consensus as an epistemological concern, and instead focus on mechanisms by which environments of multiple actors form and sustain bodies of information that enable them to go about their activities with a reasonable level of confidence that others in the supply chain will ‘do their bit,’ backed by a ‘failsafe’ mechanism enforced by cryptography which holds the actors unharmed in case the envisioned finality is not obtained. These bodies of information create what is essentially a retrospective form of common knowledge, and a lesser variant, mutual knowledge. We propose an implementation from the preferred mechanism of a multisig primitive, which builds and improves on the Gnosis multisig, in the use case of decentralized blockchain-powered supply chains consisting of multiple parties, human and machine.}

However, Ethereum smart contract lacks of ability to communicate with outside IoT environment. To enable smart contracts to fetch off-chain data, this paper proposes a data carrier architecture that is cost-effective and elastic for blockchain-enabled IoT environment. Three components, namely Mission Manager, Task Publisher and Worker, are presented in the data carrier architecture to interact with contract developer, smart contract, Ethereum node and off-chain data sources. Selective solutions are also proposed for filtering smart contract event and decoding event log to fit different requirements. The evaluation results and discussions show the proposed system will decrease about 20USD deployment cost in average for every smart contract, and it is more efficient and elastic compared with Oraclize Oracle data carrier service.}

However, the auditing process itself can become a target of inside or outside attackers in Cyber-Physical Manufacturing System (CPMS) environments because pervasive connection through various types of computer networks in CPMS opens new doors for adversaries to compromise various components in an attack detection system. To maintain an effective attack detection system and prevent data from malicious data injection, this paper presents a Layer Image Auditing System (LIAS) secured by the Blockchain technology in CPMS. LIAS consists of a pre-processing system and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP). To evaluate the prediction accuracy of LIAS, a set of simulated infill images and physical images were used for training and testing. The effectiveness of the Blockchain implementation is demonstrated by presenting the comparative performance analysis of the proposed attack detection system with and without the Blockchain.}

Blockchain was first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and developers all around the world have been trying to apply blockchain in different areas, like finance services, credit and ownership management, resource sharing, investment management, Internet of things (IoT), and so on. Ethereum is a blockchain 2.0 platform that allows developers to build a decentralized application (DApp) without building a new blockchain from scratch. IoT is the technology to embed all physical devices with sensors and chips to provide automation via machine-to-machine communication. Blynk is a platform that provides iOS and Android applications for users and developers to collect data from microcontroller. Our goal in this chapter is to build a blockchain-based, DApp named Uranus for smart building system management with private Ethereum blockchain, Raspberry Pi (RPi), Blynk platform, and sensors (e.g., DHT11). The blockchain technology in Uranus provides three benefits: (1) it is tamper-resistant, (2) it has no single point of failure, and (3) it is trusted and auditable. The system is a proof-of-concept (PoC) system prototype to simulate smart building applications. It collects real-time building temperature and humidity through a DHT11 sensor via RPi. The sensor data is updated to the Blynk app and stored on the smart contract deployed on the private Ethereum blockchain. If the real-time temperature or humidity value exceeds the threshold value set by the users, red or green LEDs will be turned on as warnings and then an air conditioner or dehumidifier will be turned on. We build a PoC smart building system to verify its feasibility and demonstrate its performance based on a simulated testbed.}

This paper illustrates the needs and requirements for managing supply chains in multi-company project environments by adopting various tracking and tracing technologies. This kind of tracking and tracing is especially needed within distributed architectures engaged in project-based businesses, where several vendors are involved in a single project. Such tracking and tracing data can be used extensively to generate key performance indicators, which can be used to measure and control supply chain processes. This paper also proposes a pilot system of a cloud-based portal for real-time tracking and tracing of logistics and supply chains. This portal is formed by the combination of RFID, IoT and blockchain technology into an integrated real-time view. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and IoT (Internet of Things) provides real-time information or data, while blockchain technology is used to provide a chain of immutable transactions. The architecture of the proposed portal system is connected to transport companies, tracking devices, consolidation points and suppliers. The pilot study also illustrates the benefits and advantages of such a portal system.}

abstract = {In conventional PKI, CAs are assumed to be fully trusted. However, in practice, CAs’ absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates’ validation, storage, and entire revocation process is conducted in CertLedger as well as Trusted CA certificate management. During a TLS connection, TLS clients get an efficient proof of existence of the certificate directly from its domain owners. Hence, privacy is now perfectly preserved by eliminating the traceability issue via OCSP servers. It also provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the security and performance of CertLedger and provide a comparison with the previous proposals. Finally, we implement its protoype on Ethereum to demonstrate experimental results. The results show that the performance of the TLS handshake and certificate validation through CertLedger is significantly improved compared to the current TLS protocol.}

A key innovation within ReFi is the tokenization of carbon credits. Consequently, this study explores the return connectedness among ReFi, carbon, fossil energy, and clean energy markets, employing a quantile time–frequency connectedness framework. Our findings indicate a relatively weak and time-varying trend in return connectedness. Notably, the pairwise connectedness within the ReFi-carbon-energy system becomes more pronounced during extreme market conditions compared to normal conditions. Moreover, clean energy markets of all sub-sectors serve as net spillover transmitters across different quantiles and time–frequency domains. In contrast, ReFi markets act as net receivers in the short term but evolve into net transmitters in the medium term, especially under extreme market conditions. Next, we examine the impacts of determinants on total connectedness, which demonstrate heterogeneity across different time horizons and market conditions. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of ReFi assets as effective diversification and hedging tools for carbon-energy portfolios. Our findings not only provide guidance for ReFi investors in constructing more cost-effective investment strategies, but also assist ReFi policymakers in cultivating a broader and trustworthier application of ReFi.}

As the digitization of industrial processes advances, Digital Twins will become widespread. As a result, there is a need to develop new secure data sharing models for a complex ecosystem of interacting Digital Twins and lifecycle parties. Decentralized Applications are uniquely suited to address these sharing challenges while ensuring availability, integrity and confidentiality. They rely on distributed ledgers and decentralized databases for data storage and processing, avoiding single points of trust. To tackle the need for decentralized sharing of Digital Twin data, this work proposes an owner-centric decentralized sharing model. A formal access control model addresses integrity and confidentiality aspects based on Digital Twin components and lifecycle requirements. With our prototypical implementation EtherTwin we show how to overcome the numerous implementation challenges associated with fully decentralized data sharing, enabling management of Digital Twin components and their associated information. For validation, the prototype is evaluated based on an industry use case and semi-structured expert interviews.}

One of the challenges of blockchain is the particular processing of dynamic queries due to accumulating costs. Complex Event Processing (CEP) provides efficient and effective support for this in a way, however, that is difficult to integrate with blockchain. This paper addresses the research challenges of integrating blockchain with CEP. More specifically, we envision an effective development environment in which (i) event-driven smart contracts are modeled in a graphical way, which are, in turn, (ii) automatically transformed into complementary code that is deployed in both a CEP engine and a blockchain network, and then (iii) executed on off-chain CEP applications which, connected to different data sources and sinks, automatically invoke smart contracts when event pattern conditions are met. We follow a classic systems engineering approach for defining the concepts of our system, called CEPchain, which addresses the described requirements. CEPchain was evaluated using a real-world case study for vaccine delivery, which requires an unbroken cold chain. The results demonstrate that our approach can be applied without requiring experts on event processing and smart contract languages. Our contribution simplifies the design of integrated CEP and blockchain functionality by hiding implementation details and supporting efficient deployment.}

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. However, existing BaaS deployment solutions are mostly vendor-locked: they are either bound to a cloud provider or a blockchain platform. In addition to deployment, design and implementation of blockchain-based applications is a hard task requiring deep expertise. Therefore, this paper presents a unified blockchain as a service platform (uBaaS) to support both design and deployment of blockchain-based applications. The services in uBaaS include deployment as a service, design pattern as a service and auxiliary services. In uBaaS, deployment as a service is platform agnostic, which can avoid lock-in to specific cloud platforms, while design pattern as a service applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The proposed solutions are evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case in terms of feasibility and scalability.}

Patent examiners are usually overworked to evaluate inventions referring to a large volume of prior arts in a short period.

Moreover, today's centralized IP administration system is inefficient in processing speed, security, and cost. Inefficiencies of IP administration in each national IP office impede speedy and efficient cooperation for international application and registration. This study proposes an IP decentralized ledger (IP dLedger) based on the blockchain to significantly reduce IP administration costs and improve IP use. IP dLedger connects the on-chain (blockchain) to the off-chain (centralized database) systems using IP codes that combine hash values and timestamps. Similar to the web hypertext method, this connective feature of IP dLedger enables users who click on identification information registered in a blockchain network to access, through a hyperlink, a centralized database of enormous volumes of related IP information. Therefore, IP dLedger can reduce IP administration costs, increase IP usage, and facilitate safe and convenient use of the IP data.}

However, with the PC boom, applications moved to smaller machines. Rudimentary word processors and standalone database applications like FORTRAN and DBase found their way into the PC screens. These applications had their own installation and upgrade challenges. Patch management and security updates were a maintenance nightmare. Slowly with improved network speeds, the design philosophy changed and centralized systems working on the client-server architecture ruled the roost and are till date the dominant architecture for middle-to-large-scale applications. However, the vertical scaling could only go as long, and with the increased data and large user base, there was a requirement to grow horizontally. Data grew and databases started bursting on the seams. Big Data was the new norm, and to handle the vast amounts of data, scaling vertically wasn’t just enough. Google has often been credited for pioneering work in horizontal scaling just out of sheer necessity to handle large volumes of data. In this chapter, we intend discussing the paradigm shift in application development from centralized to decentralized and give a brief overview of Ethereum.}

Empowering the user to select which domains can be co-tracked gives him/her the upper hand over web trackers. This allows the user to enjoy the personalized services without fearing full inter-domain tracking. To achieve this, we propose a solution that attempts to introduce layers of anonymization serving as temporary identities to be used by the user while browsing. Those identities will be used for limited time (to sustain the customization and user experience resulting from tracking), and then discarded for a new identity. This approach allows the user to divide the activity into profiles which eliminates browsing history spilling over to other sessions. We proved the security of this approach mathematically and we demonstrated its usability using an open-source Proof-of-Concept built on top of blockchain.}

Explore the influencing factors of domestic realization of green technology innovation, clarify the reasons that hinder green technology innovation and give reasonable strategies to help domestic green technology innovation work to be carried out faster and better. This article compares the ipbft algorithm with the improved consensus algorithms cpbft, vpbft and pbft in recent years. Experimental results show that the consensus delay of the ipbft algorithm is much lower than that of the other three algorithms, and the average delay of the ipbft single consensus is only about 370ms. In different transaction volume and different node number throughput performance tests, the ipbft throughput in these two tests is better than the other three algorithms. In the view switching phase, the ipbft algorithm also takes less time than the other three algorithms. The above results show that the ipbft algorithm has lower consensus delay and higher throughput, which can reduce network communication overhead and save system transmission energy consumption. It can ensure the security and authenticity of information in the green technology innovation based on blockchain, and reduce system overhead.}

In this paper, we tackle this issue via proposing a novel framework of collaborative early warning for COVID-19 based on blockchain and smart contracts, aiming to crowdsource early warning tasks to distributed channels including medical institutions, social organizations, and even individuals. Our framework supports two surveillance modes, namely, medical federation surveillance based on federated learning and social collaboration surveillance based on the learning markets approach, and fuses their monitoring results on emerging cases to alert. By using our framework, medical institutions are expected to obtain better federated surveillance models with privacy protection, and social participants without mutual trusts can also share verified surveillance resources such as data and models, and fuse their surveillance solutions. We implemented our proposed framework based on the Ethereum and IPFS platforms. Experimental results show that our framework has advantages of decentralized decision-making, fairness, auditability, and universality. It also has potential guidance and reference value for the early warning and prevention of unknown infectious diseases.}

abstract = {A Smart Contract (SC) is a piece of code executed on the blockchain to automatically trigger transactions upon the occurrence of predefined events. Due to the intrinsic features regarding traceability and data immutability, many companies started using blockchain Smart Contracts to perform collaborative processes. Despite their promising features, there is a lack of Smart Contacts management platforms that enable blockchain participants to describe and publish their smart contacts or “search and match” already deployed ones. In this paper, a new Distributed Smart Directory (DSD) where providers can publish their SCs description is proposed. The SCs descriptions include metadata covering functional, and non-functional properties of the SC. Hence, users can find SCs according to their non-functional preferences, needs, and constraints. The proposed DSD is an extension of the ebXML directory. It was fully implemented on-chain. The SCs descriptions are generated based on the Uniform Description language for SC (UDL-SC). The proposed solution is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. It was then tested and evaluated.}

abstract = {With the recent advances in Information and Communication Technologies in the construction industry, information is exchanged digitally with little regard to the contracts that govern them. Although parties collaborating in project design are contracted to the client, they transact with each other when using BIM and other collaborative practices without any direct contractual relationship among themselves. This results in a lack of design liability control and an increase in claims and disputes. Further, the use of multiple software packages results in the exposure of data to third parties, data corruption and compromise in data privacy (using data for unintended purposes), data integrity (unauthorised access to sensitive data), and data longevity (loss of data post-handover). This study investigates blockchain technology (BCT) to address these issues using a design science research method. The current information exchange processes were mapped to identify the critical transactions that may benefit from record-keeping on the blockchain. Next, a prototype was designed to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed BCT integrated process models. Three key project processes, design review, design coordination and request for information; and two potential conflict scenarios during and post-construction were simulated as part of the evaluation. The prototype's implementation exhibits BCT's ability to record snapshots of individual design inputs to the overall project design and to enable a clear and long-term record of key exchange transactions. This improves the design liability control for contributing stakeholders and the auditability of the exchange records. Further, the proofs derived from such a system are independent of any third-party storage or subscription. Given the nature of records stored in a blockchain, the existence, integrity, and authenticity of information along with its associated metadata can be verified in the long-term as well. Therefore, BCT could be a supplementary technology that supports the existing information exchange systems.}

abstract = {The integration of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in healthcare, particularly in cardiovascular medicine, represents a disruptive shift towards enhancing the security and interconnection of electronic health data around the patient. NFTs, unique digital certificates stored on a blockchain network, bind various sources of health data to their owner (the patient) and delineate the access rights for stakeholders (providers, researchers) using smart contracts. Data sources may include electronic medical records from different hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, test centers, and mHealth devices. Accordingly, patients and their providers benefit from seamless visibility of diagnoses, medications, electrocardiograms, imaging, home blood pressure logs, and artificial intelligence-enabled insights from these aggregated data. Rather than being stored on proprietary servers, data are encrypted and stored on decentralized networks with a unified point of access and immutable proof of ownership, making them more robust to theft or tampering. As custodians of their NFT, patients are incentivized to actively partake in their health monitoring and self-driven research that aligns with their needs using innovative marketplaces that allow them to browse studies, document their informed consent, and monetize their contributions. Furthermore, they are empowered to educate themselves and seek care across siloes in traditional settings or virtual platforms such as the metaverse, where NFTs serves as digital passports. Despite these exciting prospects, adoption within the healthcare sector remains in its infancy, with ethical and technical limitations still being addressed. This article explores the multifaceted applications and key players in the field, and outlines use-cases for patient-centered cardiovascular care featuring NFTs.}

Traditionally, the research databases are assigned electronic identifiers, and manuscripts are preserved in electronic form. Owing to the large scale of submissions in the databases, it becomes difficult for the repositories to manage their electronic volumes. The search queries and retrievals are complex, and the publishing process takes a lot of time, which defeats the purpose of the contribution in many cases by the author. Moreover, the process is non-transparent, and is limited due to ineffective article tracking policies. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the libraries have transitioned towards smart objects that process academic repositories with low-powered computations. In the same way, meta-information passes through lightweight IoT protocols to distributed servers. Coupled with blockchain (BC), a secured and trusted publishing platform is assured in SPS, with transparency among all academic stakeholders. Traditional SPS platforms do not provide any rewarding method for peer review and do not support and store unsuccessful articles. Besides, published works are not verified thoroughly, and this can lead to misconduct in scientific publishing. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a survey on the fusion of BC and IoT for SPS, which serves the dual purpose of low-powered computational tagging of manuscripts as smart objects, and that also supports rewarding and completing the verification of transactions by peers without involving a third party. A case study of a hyperledger driven IoT-enabled scientific publishing system (SPS) is proposed to address the limitations of the traditional SPS. Lastly, we present open issues and challenges concerning the current SPSs and the proposed BC-driven SPS.}

An emissions trading system (ETS) is one of the environmental policies for controlling carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion during transport activities. To investigate the status of existing ETS interventions on ground transportation emissions, a comprehensive literature review is conducted, including policy evaluation and comparison, scheme optimization and design, and specific transport behavior interventions. The results show that existing upstream policies are insufficient in stringency and effectiveness, while policy implementation for downstream interventions remains limited. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes a downstream ground transportation emissions trading system (GTETS), incorporating the Internet of Things and blockchain technology. As well as road and rail transportation emissions, the system includes the emissions-related activities of individuals and transportation companies, and its Web3-based technologies provide effective and efficient monitoring, reporting, and verification.}

abstract = {In digitization, judicial investigations have transitioned towards digital storage of forensic shreds of evidence as electronic law records (ELRs). The shift poses varied challenges of ELR preservation, homogeneity of case formats, chronology in recorded statements by suspects, time-stamping and digital signatures on ELRs, and the chain of transfer of cases to different law enforcement agencies (LEAs) over open channels. Thus, privacy and trust among judicial stakeholders-case appellant (CA), case defendant (CD), the police officer (PO), defence lawyer (DL), prosecutor lawyers (PL), LEAs, and court judge is a prime concern. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, the paper presents a blockchain (BC)-based ELR management scheme, NyaYa, that operates as a four-phased scheme of judicial stakeholder registration in BC, case registration with meta-hash keys in public BC, that reference an external off-chain interplanetary file storage (IPFS), chronology of investigative updates among LEAs, and case hearing and settlement through smart contracts (SCs). In the simulation, NyaYa is compared to traditional ELR storage schemes for parameters like mining cost, query fetching time, block processing time, obtained IPFS throughput, signing latency, the effect of collusion attacks, ELR processing time, and corrupted indexes in IPFS. We also presented formal verification and proposed functionalities of SCs. In simulation, at 6 USD mining cost, NyaYa can append 22456 transactions, compared to 21497 and 3000 transactions respectively in existing schemes. The achieved query fetching time is 0.852 milli-seconds (ms), at 25 blocks, with cache support of 32 kilobyte (KB). The scheme has an average signing latency of 622.95ms, and achieves a high-trust probability of 0.887 %, compared to 0.765 % in consortium BC, and 0.455 % in private BC, at 500, colluding nodes. An improvement of 6.77 % is achieved in ELR uploading latency, and the scheme has only 21 corrupted IPFS indexes for 350 fetched ELRs. The obtained results indicate the efficacy of the proposed scheme against conventional schemes.}

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) and blockchain are two emerging technologies with significant potential for the construction industry. Numerous studies have investigated the use of VR to improve construction safety training. However, there is a lack of research focused on encouraging employees to participate in VR training. Fortunately, incentive mechanisms are a powerful motivator, capable of driving employees to actively participate in and excel at safety practices. Incorporating blockchain-based incentives into safety training creates a win-win scenario which can substantially improve training outcomes. To this end, this paper proposes a token incentive mechanism based on blockchain technology for VR-based safety training, consisting of unique safety training scenarios and a flexible virtual environment that enables users to acquire knowledge of construction safety regulations. The framework supports real-time interaction and communication among users and provides blockchain-based tokens to incentivize safe conduct and reward individuals who have undergone safety training. A prototype was developed and evaluated through interactive system trials with senior students, site managers, and construction site employees. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework can motivate users to participate in safety training regularly and improve their safety awareness and knowledge before performing tasks at construction sites. In addition, the framework fosters collaboration among employees and assists safety managers in creating novel VR-based safety training scenarios that can be delivered to workers easily. By incentivizing safety training, the proposed framework contributes to establishing a new safety culture wherein workers can effectively acquire knowledge and financial benefits through completing safety training activities.}

We provide empirical evidence that open standards and blockchain-based governance are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a decentralized and neutral platform. Centralization and concentrated voting power may lead to dependencies, rent extraction behavior and create hold-up problems. Consequently, producers, prosumers and service providers must evaluate the governance structure of the platform before establishing a presence.}

Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the “single point of failure” problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time.}

Indeed, many blockchain use cases are being developed today in different areas. Due to the complexity of certain processes, a new technology associated to blockchain has appeared – smart contracts. These digital contracts act like traditional contracts, with the major difference being their automaticity.

To provide a payment system and record transaction information, public blockchain is designed to match the decentralized feature of the P2P market. The incentive for nodes outside the microgrid is removed but it is maintained for the prosumers within the microgrid. Therefore the number of miner competitors is limited to decrease the mining difficulty and its power consumption. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol defines the function of blockchain with its mining mechanism. Miners sacrifice part of their stake to compensate for the power losses and reduce the price gap from the traditional prosumer-to-grid trading (Feed-in-tariff). Moreover, the proposed model also contributes to increase the social welfare by improving producers’ income and consumers’ cost-saving through the designed pricing scheme, which eliminates the price gap between buying and selling. Successful mining is encouraged by rewards accordingly. A case study is introduced where a microgrid model with 27 prosumers is tested with the PoS public blockchain-based pricing scheme. The process of model implementation and smart contract creation are specifically demonstrated. Numerical results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

This paper explores and discusses how NFTs, analysed through the lens of the Technology Organisation Environment (TOE) framework, can drive supply chain sustainability and overcome the barriers to Blockchain Technology (BCT) adoption. We elucidate the unique value proposition of NFTs and explore the potential of ‘phygital products’ for linking digital NFTs to physical goods. Based on the existing literature and a review of real-world case studies, we propose that NFTs can (1) incentivise supply chain stakeholders to engage in more sustainable practices; (2) enhance customer willingness to pay for sustainable products; (3) provide anti-counterfeit measures; (4) support circular business model growth. A sustainable 'Mint-to-Order' production strategy starting with the creation (minting) of an NFT is proposed based on a synthesis of the findings. The use of NFTs has significant implications for both digital and physical product offerings and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practice making a compelling case for adoption. This paper is one of the first to explore the potential of using NFTs to drive sustainability in supply chains forming an essential component of a metaverse nexus and delineating a future research agenda.}

Unfortunately, when such a permissioned blockchain runs on a large scale on the Internet, these explicit committee nodes can be easily turned down by denial-of-service (DoS) or network partition attacks. Although recent studies proposed scalable BFT protocols that run on a larger number of committee nodes, these protocols’ efficiency drops dramatically when only a small number of nodes are attacked. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol named Eges that leverages hardware trusted execution environments (e.g., Intel SGX) to develop a new abstraction called “stealth committee”, which effectively hides a committee into a large pool of fake committee nodes. Eges selects a different stealth committee for each block and confirms the same blocks among all nodes with overwhelming probability. Our evaluation shows that Eges is the first efficient permissioned blockchain’s consensus protocol, which simultaneously satisfies two important metrics: (1) Eges can tolerate tough DoS and network partition attacks; and (2) Eges achieves comparable throughput and latency as existing fastest permissioned blockchains’ consensus protocols. Eges’s source code is available on http://github.com/hku-systems/eges.}

Within the DID chain, we deploy two contracts: the IdentityManager Contract and the PersonalIdentity Contract. Users are empowered to register their decentralized identity, while governments can leverage the IdentityManager Contract to generate decentralized identities. Once users obtain their identity, they can proceed to register the app-chain using that identity. Moreover, users can utilize the AccessControlManager chaincode within the App-chain to share de-identified information generated by their wearable devices, retaining full control over managing the access control rights of their de-identified information. Through the integration of these two chains, our system significantly enhances user data privacy, security, and trust, thereby fostering confidence in the integration of wearable devices within the home healthcare data sharing process.}

abstract = {The emergence of a data-driven society has sparked interest in data trading marketplaces. Traditional centralized marketplaces are unable to meet the needs of a transparent, safe, and privacy-protected data marketplace. To address the above challenges, we propose a data marketplace on blockchain with arbitration using side-contracts mechanisms (dMOBAs), in which a consortium of data owners, data buyers, and arbitrators collaborate to create an ecosystem in the blockchain’s witnesses. Our marketplace’s goals are to provide a decentralized platform for trading personal data for both service providers and data owners. In the meantime, the transaction method can be arbitrated. The arbitrators alliance, which is responsible for resolving data disputes, is formed by a service provider jointly nominated by the buyer and seller. The integrity and value of transacted data can be validated thanks to the arbitrators’ consortium. The side-contracts concept decreases the public chain’s overhead and enhances the marketplace’s operating efficiency. The marketplace’s orderly functioning is ensured by explicit incentives and rigorous arbitration methods. To demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the mechanisms, we implement dMOBAs on Ethereum, Fabric and IPFS platforms and analyze its performance. According to the testing results, our arbitration method is 2 times faster than full public chain-based arbitration.}

Emerging blockchain technology allows DIMSs to be deployed in it, which largely alleviates the problems caused by the centralized third party, but its inherent transparency and lack of privacy pose a huge challenge to DIMSs. In this regard, we leverage the smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms to improve the existing claim identity model in blockchain to realize the identity unlinkability, effectively avoiding the exposure of the ownership of attributes. Furthermore, we implement a system prototype named BZDIMS that includes a challenge-response protocol, which allows users to selectively disclose their ownership of attributes to service providers to protect users’ behavior privacy. Performance evaluation and security analysis show that our scheme achieves effective attribute privacy protection and a wider application scope compared with the prior model.}

On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people. As a result, the current model suffers from good governance. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information. As a result, Blockchain adoption can improve the land title digitization effort of Bangladesh.}

The choice of trust metric will depend on context, circumstance and user requirements and there is no single best metric for use in all circumstances. Where different users require different trust metrics to be employed the trust score calculations should still be based on all available trust evidence. Trust is normally computed using past experiences but, in practice (especially in centralised systems), the validity and accuracy of these experiences are taken for granted. In this paper, we provide a formal framework and practical blockchain-based implementation that allows independent trust providers to implement different trust metrics in a distributed manner while still allowing all trust providers to base their calculations on a common set of trust evidence. Further, our design allows experiences to be provably linked to interactions without the need for a central authority. This leads to the notion of evidence-based trust with provable interactions. Leveraging blockchain allows the trust providers to offer their services in a competitive manner, charging fees while users are provided with payments for recording experiences. Performance details of the blockchain implementation are provided.}

Off-Chain Blockchain Systems (OCBS) enable this information processing and management through distributed software architecture where the blockchain network interacts with off-chain resources. Hence, OCBS are a critical data governance component in the design of enterprise blockchain solutions, resulting in extensive research and development exploring the interplay between on-chain and off-chain storage and computation and efforts to evaluate their performance relative to other information management systems. Key features of OCBS’ are their ability to improve scalability, reduce data storage requirements, and enhance data privacy, all extremely critical issues to enable broader blockchain adoption. These OCBS features map well to the needs of the healthcare industry, particularly due to the need to manage various types of medical, consumer, and other health-related data. However, different types of health data are also subject to stringent regulatory, security and legal requirements, a key factor limiting blockchain adoption in the sector. In response, there is a critical need to better align OCBS design features to different types of healthcare data management and their respective governance and privacy regimes. This article first reviews the characteristics of different constructs of OCBS. It then proposes a modular hybrid privacy-preserving framework leveraging off-chain and on-chain blockchain system design applied to three different reference models that illustrate how blockchain can enhance healthcare information management. Through this privacy-preserving framework we hope to liberate healthcare data by enabling sharing, sovereignty and enhanced trust.}

Firstly, we propose a model to count newly arrived tips (transactions) into a selected timeframe and calculate the transaction time before joining the Tangle network as a new tip. Selecting secure transactions for approval requires an accurate tip selection method. Secondly, we develop the Best Tip Selection Method (BTSM) to increase network security and to incorporate the priority level for essential or prioritized IoT transactions. Thirdly, we develop a multiple-objective unconstrained optimization strategy, the Best Approver Selection Method (BASM). The objective of BASM is to optimize the trade-off between the multiplication of network latency and the cumulative weight of transactions and approvers’ Tangle time after joining the network. Finally, we estimate the probability of malicious attacks on a Tangle network by assuming the transactions’ cumulative weight increases linearly with transaction arrival speed to a Tangle. We adapt the fault-tolerance relationship to secure the system. We then analyze our model to decide that requires us to consider the trade-off between these two factors to obtain the optimal value. Our results show that BTSM and BASM are viable solutions for next-generation Industrial IoT networks with fast machine-to-machine communications. Compared with IOTA and other existing strategies, our proposed model offers the advantage of identifying the probability of malicious attacks with high accuracy; thus minimizing malicious attacks and optimizing the network latency for next-generation Industrial IoT networks. In summary, the proposed mechanism would allow adding more transactions from IoT devices to the IOTA Tangle and discourage existing malicious transactions from verifying new transactions. The proposed mechanism could be utilized in real-world applications, including enabling preference levels for essential or prioritized activities and fault-tolerance adaptation. IOTA aims to play a vital role in the next-generation industrial revolution; our study advances the IOTA Tangle to move a step forward towards this direction.}

Since IoT devices are equipped only with lightweight operation systems, the installation of antivirus software cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, a method through which the firmware of IoT devices can be securely and autonomously updated must be developed. This paper proposes a blockchain-based firmware updating platform to enhance the process of updating firmware. A smart contract is used to ensure integrity and enforce the scanning of malicious code. With a peer-to-peer file sharing system, our platform enjoys high availability without the single failure point problem, mitigating the possibility of DDoS attacks. We use batch verification in case of multiple updating requests for better scalability. Through function comparisons and performance simulation, our scheme is shown to be effective in strengthening IoT security.}

However, areas such as service quality-based pricing strategies, supply–demand balancing in distribution system to attain enhanced reliability and consumption-oriented rewarding mechanisms need improving in order to achieve the full benefits of the envisaged grid architecture. In response, this study proposes a novel Blockchain-as-a-Service for Energy Trading (BaaSET) platform, which offers reputation-based services, executed through smart contracts for smart grid applications. Reputation-based grid operations are automatically executed through smart contracts deployed onto a blockchain. The reputation is estimated using power quality and reliability indices, obtained through grid measurements. Further, tests have been conducted to evaluate the associated latency and the implementation cost of the proposed blockchainized service architecture. Test results signify the performance to be comparatively better considering the state-of-the-art. The results further suggest alternatives to improve the scalability of the architecture, to cater the increasing number of stakeholders in the SG 2.0 environment.}

In this chapter, we introduce a trust-free data access model for personal sensitive data protection in the cloud environment. In our model, an access control mechanism is constructed based on the Ethereum blockchain, which requires no trusted party. The smart contract enables fine-grained access control for cloud data based on the blockchain. Data operations including uploading, updating and downloading can be automated processed and logged in our model to ensure transparency and auditability. Comparisons between our model and existing models show that our trust-free model fulfills all requirements on personal sensitive data protection, and brings no extra security risks.

Therefore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of patients’ medical data, we can improve the current issues by employing blockchain, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof technology. In this paper, we propose a novel medical insurance claim scheme based on smart contracts, blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme mainly involves two scenarios: medical insurance purchasing and medical insurance claiming. In the privacy-preserving transaction phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and privacy of the transactions between the patients and the insurance companies by using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and the homomorphic encryption algorithm under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In the identity privacy-preserving phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and the privacy of patients’ identities by integrating Schnorr protocol and Fiat–Shamir heuristic method. The security analysis, the computation cost and the communication cost of our scheme are given. Compared with our referred schemes, the performance evaluation shows that our scheme not only meets the requirements of the legality of the medical insurance claim, but also ensures the authenticity and privacy of the patients’ medical data. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is feasible and has an acceptable time overhead.}

Our results showed that economic governance is based on metaverse tokens that cannot be defined as reliable virtual currencies due to their explosive behaviour, negative performance, and higher volatility compared to traditional alternatives. Paradoxically, fiat currencies and stablecoins could be more appropriate candidates for the payment infrastructure. Moreover, we also observed that NFT prices are affected by the cryptocurrency market, which highlights the risk of metaverse commerce. For future research, developers and scholars must assess the different alternatives and infrastructures that can make the metaverse a persistent reality with a proper virtual economy.

An ICS controls a physical plant through the use of sensors and actuators. A Historian sits on a plant network and receives, parses, and saves data and commands transmitted over the network, across the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors and actuators. This data has at least two uses. One use is to check for any process anomalies that may occur due to component failures and cyber attacks. The other use of this data, and the focus of this work, is to serve as critical input to off-line activities such as forensic analysis. A cyber attack on the Historian could jeopardize any forensic analysis be it for maintenance, or discovering an attack trail. In this work, a novel architecture, named ICS-BlockOpS, is proposed to secure plant operational data recorded in the Historian. ICS-BlockOpS is designed to enhance data security along two dimensions: immutability and redundancy. An integrity checking mechanism, in combination with blockchain, is used to ensure data integrity. Data redundancy is achieved by applying an efficient replication mechanism and enables data recovery after an attack. A prototype implementation of ICS-BlockOpS uses Ethereum blockchain in the local network as part of the tamper proofing mechanism. The implementation is in an operational six-stage water treatment plant. The underlying design ideas are generic and could be applied to other ICS as well.}

This chapter constitutes a comparative study of Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, specifically their “Clients Types,” “Transactions,” and “Networks”. It start from explaining Bitcoin reference client, also known as satoshi client, and Bitcoin core client specifications. Information about the Bitcoin network status is obtained by Bitcoin core client for, e.g., version, protocol version, and wallet version, etc., while Ethereum clients are software which implements Ethereum specification and make communication with other peers in Ethereum network, there are two types of clients in Ethereum: full node and remote client, such as parity and geth. Explanation moves further for Bitcoin transactions, their status that is spent or unspent, and their keys used in transactions for Bitcoins. In Bitcoin it is also required to cryptographically secure random number generator for creating private keys. Ethereum transactions are also cryptographically signed messages, but in contrast with Bitcoin, transactions only can trigger a change of state of singleton blockchain or can causes a smart contract to execute. This chapter will be useful for detailed information and technical differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum platforms.}

With the development of Internet of Things and object detection in deep learning, it is possible to enable object detection in end devices. In this paper, we propose a coordinated recognition scheme based on YOLOv3 to automatically detect safety helmets at construction sites. Our scheme provides coordinated recognition from multiple devices to obtain comprehensive detection results with multiple viewpoints, which improves the detection accuracy. Besides, to strengthen the security and reliability of detection devices, we propose a peer-to-peer cooperation scheme which is based on smart contract over blockchain. Our scheme ensures that only trusted devices can initiate or participate coordinated recognition tasks. All access and detection records are stored in the blockchain, which is auditable and traceable. Moreover, we propose a fair video sharing mechanism which encourages trusted devices to actively participate in the coordinated recognition tasks. Only participated nodes can access the shared detection videos from others, which forms an alliance of fair sharing with long term interest. The experimental results and analysis justify that our scheme performs well in terms of security and detection accuracy at few expense of a certain startup delay. Our framework can be employed for detecting other objects related to risks in smart construction.}

Visual data of construction sites is processed through a computer-vision module, which reports safety performance. These reports are evaluated in a network of smart contracts, using a decentralized oracle network (DON), and token-based rewards are determined and distributed accordingly. Users can redeem their FT rewards or NFTs through an interactive front-end portal. The proposed method is successfully implemented through a synthetic case study to prove its feasibility.

abstract = {Production processes are becoming increasingly complex and decentralized, spanning across multiple manufacturing areas, factories, and even countries. Thereby is the development of a holistic and data-continuous traceability system, which provides transparency of records for the entire manufacturing flow from raw materials to the final product, one of the main challenges. While some solutions already address traceability issues in supply chain management and manufacturing, customized and volatile industries, in which each product features a unique configuration, are still lacking appropriate models and proofs of concept. In this research, we develop a decentralized blockchain application called TokenTrail, which focuses on the specific traceability requirements of multi-hierarchical assembly structures. The proposed blockchain architecture is based on a consortium Ethereum network and a Proof of Authority consensus, which delivers a trusted and shared database within an economic processing framework. To overcome the challenges of managing liaison transformations, we develop an assembly token manager based on the semi-fungible ERC 1155 token, which enables a direct representation of complex assembly processes and structures containing unique parts and batches within one smart contract. A user-friendly front-end application simplifies the querying of the recorded traceability data and visualizes existing dependencies.}

IIoT devices usually have limited computational power, while IIoT applications are mostly mission-critical and/or safety-critical. Therefore, these applications need computing resources that are closer to the devices. This work proposes a decentralized auction-based resource allocation mechanism in edge computing enabled IIoT using consortium blockchain and smart contract that shelves the involvement of a trusted third party, i.e. auctioneer. Various quality parameters are considered during resource allocation to address the mobility of both IIoT devices and edge resources, heterogeneity of edge servers, false assurance of edge servers, reliability, delay in results, and responsiveness of edge servers. Utility functions for IIoT devices are designed to calculate their degree of satisfaction depending on various quality parameters. The proposed blockchain-aided auction based mechanism fulfills various auction-based resource allocation requirements such as seal bidding, no impersonation of the bidder, no modification in any bid or result of allocation by the auctioneer, and proof for winners. The proposed work encourages edge servers for truthful bidding and furnishes the allocation results in polynomial time. Performance evaluation of the proposed model exhibits encouraging results.}

Blockchain achieves decentralization of power, trust, and secured of being hacked, which solves major problems or issues with the current systems. Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain platform because of its unlimited block size. Many complex problems with smart contracts can be implemented with Ethereum and the eradication of third party organizations interfering in transactions helps solving the issues of financial crisis and it is easy to implement compared to other blockchain technologies. There are certain limitations/issues in processing large number of transactions due to lack of speed in processing the transactions. Ethereum Blockchain code will be executed by different clients with varying speed and the performance level will be different. The goal of this paper is to understand Ethereum transactions and perform the comparative analysis of Geth and Parity ethereum clients on the private blockchain. In this paper, a private blockchain network is setup where the nodes will share the data among peer nodes or blocks within the network. Using this network setup a democracy voting application is developed which makes use of the blockchain to store and process the data, smart contracts are deployed to execute the transactions. Performance analysis of the two most popular ethereum clients Geth and Parity is carried out considering time, consistency and scalability parameters. Results interpret that the overall transactions are 91% on average faster in parity client as compared to Geth client.}

In this work, for the first time, we propose a decentralized auctioning and trading framework for cloud virtual machines based on blockchain. We realize both auction fairness and trade fairness among participants (e.g., cloud provider and cloud users), which guarantees each participant will not suffer any loss as long as it follows the protocol.

For example, this practice of selling random assortments of virtual items for a price has been criticized for its lack of transparency since, before purchasing a loot box, players do not necessarily know the possible items they can win and the associated probabilities. Even in the rare cases when the list of items and probabilities are available, there are no guarantees that a game is actually using that information when randomly drawing an item, which naturally results in a trust problem. We draw from decision theory to explain the transparency and trust issues faced by loot boxes, and from a recently proposed decision model by Pedersen et al. (2019) to motivate the use of blockchain technology in this context. Following the design science research framework (Peffers et al., 2007), we then explain how loot boxes can be coded as smart contracts running on a blockchain network, and why this solution effectively tackles the transparency and trust problems we mentioned above. We illustrate the use of the proposed smart contract by developing a decentralized application (DApp) that mimics the process of purchasing and opening a loot box. We carefully analyze our solution by considering its computational complexity, accuracy, security, and cost aspects. We further discuss topics related to governance and deployment so as to help the video game industry with a potential real-life implementation of our solution.}

Blockchain is a potential technology that can resolve most of these issues, however, it is difficult to find an appropriate consensus protocol applicable to crowdsourcing systems. Therefore, this work presents a Trust and Transactions Chain (TTC) consensus protocol built upon blockchain technology. It selects a trusted leader and validators considering a trust model which depends on deposit ratio, block generation and validation rate, and waiting rate. The TTC protocol addresses the main challenge of ensuring correctness related to critical systems of crowdsourcing which has extreme significance as their failure can result in disastrous consequences. This work is primarily focused on fraud-resilience avoiding double-spending attack. It also deals with sybil and eclipse attacks. Model checking is exploited because it is effective and automatic to conduct formal verification. The TTC protocol is formally modeled utilizing Communicating Sequential Programs, and the fraud-resilience property is specified using Linear Temporal Logic. The verification of the model is done using Process Analysis Toolkit that takes the formal model and specified properties as input to inspect the properties’ satisfaction or violation. The results of the formal verification are analyzed with respect to the verification time and the number of visited states.}

The method was successfully implemented for payments to 7 subcontractors in two real-world commercial construction projects in Canada and United States where progress was captured using a camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a laser scanner. The method eliminates reliance on today's heavily intermediated payment applications and showed promise for achieving accurate, efficient, and timely payment administration.

The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intra-trading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency “Cosmos (Atom)” is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism. The proposed design framework presented in this paper has addressed the implementation of an effective energy management platform for developing a self-sustained microgrid system using distributed energy resources.}

Subsequently, we argue that social media as an idea should be reimagined independently of the limited group of platforms that currently monopolize it. To that end, we discuss alternative models such as federated, blockchain-based and public-service social media platforms, and the measures required to ensure a level playing field for their emergence.}

Healthcare organizations are gradually outsourcing the massive-scale electronic healthcare records (EHRs) on cloud paradigm. This specialized cloud-assisted EHR storage architecture facilitates the healthcare organizations with high scalability, flexibility, low-cost operations, and availability to outsourced EHRs. As EHR often contains patients’ sensitive medical information, it becomes essential to ensure the confidentiality and proper secrecy of the outsourced EHRs. Moreover, in the cloud-assisted EHR storage model, the patients no longer have direct control over their outsourced EHRs, which may also cause severe integrity and confidentiality related security issues. Presently, the healthcare industry observes that the emerging immutable blockchain technology properly attains the basic security needs for developing a secure cloud assisted EHR storage framework. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a model named “DS-Chain”11A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the 22nd IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (IEEE HPCC - 2020).. - a novel deletable consortium blockchain based secure EHR storage model in a multi-cloud paradigm. The model’s key idea is to integrate each EHR outsourcing’s operations into a transaction on a novel efficient consortium blockchain. The proposed model ensures the confidentiality of the EHR’s sensitive medical information and guarantees the proper integrity and correctness of the outsourced EHRs. On the other hand, we employ the collaborative multi-cloud storage model that offers reasonable durability and availability for the outsourced EHRs in the cloud paradigm. Furthermore, we also arrange all the transactions according to their corresponding EHR’s type over the blockchain network, ensuring efficient block deletion. The detailed security analysis with proper formal proofs guarantees the computational intractability of the proposed model. Finally, the extensive performance analysis with test-simulations illustrates the feasibility and practicability of the proposed model.}

abstract = {With the greater availability and reduced dimensions of complex electronics, an Internet of Things (IoT) will emerge in the future, in which machines use sensors to collect and evaluate information about the physical world and share it with other machines without having to rely on human interaction. Blockchain technology encompasses features such as trustworthiness and decentralization and these features can be advantageous in the IoT context, as they can help to ensure data integrity in an Internet of Things unmonitored by humans. In the course of this paper, we investigate to what extent the use of blockchain technology is feasible for autonomous devices in IoT. For this purpose, a prototypical client blockchain component is built using the single-board computer Raspberry Pi and a simulated Ethereum blockchain. This prototype will be examined for aspects like proper functionality, response times and performance.}

abstract = {Initial coin offering (ICO) is a Web-3 based financing method for ventures, which allows them to use digital assets (e.g., tokens) to raise capital. During an ICO, the entrepreneur has control on ownership; they can choose to issue a very small number of tokens which would allow them to keep “their skin in the game” and retain ownership, or issue all the tokens they hold, which would distribute ownership to investors and have a community-decentralized orientation. While previous literature has identified several factors of ICO success, they have not delved into the role of ownership in ICO success. In this study, we explore whether retaining or distributing ownership during an ICO is more beneficial for raising capital. We find a two-pronged explanation. When looking at ICOs maintaining a higher level of ownership, entrepreneurs are catering to corporate-market logic investors, and we see a U relationship where the optimal percentage in which the entrepreneurs show they have skin in the game at the same time as giving enough to investors. But then, there are ICOs distributing most of its ownership in which entrepreneurs are attracting community-oriented investors, and as such, the higher the distribution the higher the investment. We propose that this is related to how there are different investors audiences’ that will value different practices and ideals and choose differently on what types of projects to invest in. Our research elucidates this new funding source. Nonetheless, future research should investigate these exploratory findings.}

abstract = {Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm which expands cloud-based computing services near the network edge. With this new computing paradigm, new challenges arise in terms of security and privacy. These concerns are due to the distributed ownership of Fog devices. Because of the large scale distributed nature of devices at the Fog layer, secure authentication for communication among these devices is a major challenge. The traditional authentication methods (password-based, certificate-based and biometric-based) are not directly applicable due to the unique architecture and characteristics of the Fog. Moreover, the traditional authentication methods consume significantly more computation power and incur high latency, and this does not meet the key requirements of the Fog. To fill this gap, this article proposes a secure decentralised location-based device to device (D2D) authentication model in which Fog devices can mutually authenticate each other at the Fog layer by using Blockchain. We considered an Ethereum Blockchain platform for the Fog device registration, authentication, attestation and data storage. We presented the overall system architecture, various participants and their transactions and message interaction between the participants. We validated the proposed model by comparing it with the existing method; results showed that the proposed authentication mechanism was efficient and secure. From the performance evaluation, it was found that the proposed method is computationally efficient and secure in a highly distributed Fog network.}

One of the leading causes of climate change is the emissions of harmful gases, particularly CO2. In 1997, the Kyoto protocol was signed by 192 countries, creating a system that monetizes CO2 emissions with an aim to control them. Most countries signed a carbon trading scheme, but the scheme fell short of its goals due to manipulation, lack of integrity, and multiple other challenges. This work presents an improved blockchain-based approach to achieve the objective of monitoring the reduction of carbon emissions. Blockchain's distinct features such as security, immutability, transparency, traceability, and trust, make it a robust and reliable solution for the carbon trading market. Previous Blockchain-based proposals were not comprehensive, practical, applicable, or efficient enough to form an effective solution. This research addresses the current gaps and proposes a comprehensive three-stage hierarchical blockchain framework that employs smart contracts in Blockchain of Things (BoT) to ensure integrity in the system and reach fair trade status that favors the environment over companies' cost reductions and profit-making. The result is an optimized carbon emission trading framework, fully transparent with automated trading and control mechanisms.}

To ensure the reliability of IIoT systems, robust fault detection is necessary, which can be provided by artificial intelligence (AI). The current state-of-the-art approach for AI in IIoT is mainly focused on centralized learning, which is inefficient due to its high communication cost. Federated learning (FL) addresses this limitation by enabling distributed training without exposing individual information. In order to provide secure and efficient FL for the IIoT environment, several research studies have investigated the use of blockchain networks. However, most of these studies ignore the processing time metric, which is crucial for IIoT networks. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient parameter aggregation technique that enhances trust, security, and privacy for IIoT. We use a lightweight smart contract deployed with a proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain in combination with a Gaussian differential privacy mechanism. We evaluate our proposed system using a real bearing fault dataset and demonstrate that it is able to provide a secure aggregation process with an accuracy of 94.00% and a processing time of 1.54 s, which is suitable for the IIoT environment with a private blockchain network.}

This dynamic landscape is characterized by a myriad of innovative solutions, ranging from decentralized finance and supply chain management to digital identity and voting systems, each contributing to the ongoing advancement and adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors. Achieving interoperability among these applications and platforms poses a significant challenge due to their use of distinct protocols, and remains a bottleneck hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. Addressing this challenge requires designing a universal interoperability protocol while ensuring compliance with the security and privacy constraints specific to each blockchain, thus adding complexity. We propose an agnostic interoperability protocol designed for seamless asset movement across independent private blockchain networks, regardless of their individual protocols. This protocol leverages incentive-driven smart contract and Zero-Knowledge Proofs to establish a decentralized, secure, and privacy-focused framework for interoperability. We conduct a security analysis using game theory and provide both theoretical and empirical evaluations of the protocol end-to-end delay. Through a comprehensive use case, we demonstrate the secure deployment of the proposed protocol for asset movement between two private blockchains. We also discuss the trade-offs between cost and delay in cross-blockchain transactions. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing interoperability schemes showcases the proposed interoperability scheme superiority in terms of robustness, privacy preservation, and verifiability.}

abstract = {In this paper, an integrated blockchain-based energy management platform is proposed that optimizes energy flows in a microgrid whilst implementing a bilateral trading mechanism. Physical constraints in the microgrid are respected by formulating an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, which is combined with a bilateral trading mechanism in a single optimization problem. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the problem to enable distributed optimization and a smart contract is used as a virtual aggregator. This eliminates the need for a third-party coordinating entity. The smart contract fulfills several functions, including distribution of data to all participants and executing part of the ADMM algorithm. The model is run using actual data from a prosumer community in Amsterdam and several scenarios of the model are tested to evaluate the impact of combining physical constraints and trading on social welfare of the community and scheduling of energy flows. The scenario variants are trade-only, where only a trading mechanism is implemented, grid-only where only OPF optimization is implemented and a combined scenario where both are implemented. Results are compared with a baseline scenario. Simulation results show that import costs of the whole community are reduced by 34.9% as compared to a baseline scenario, and total energy import quantities are reduced by 15%. Total social welfare is found to be highest without a trading mechanism, however this platform is only viable when all costs are equally shared between all households. Furthermore, peak imports are reduced by over 50% in scenarios including grid constraints.}

A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked.}

As the combination of end devices and networking techniques, it becomes more and more possible that people can organize an IoT system to serve more extensive industrial and scientific needs by running a higher level of machine learning models, such as Federated Learning (FL) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) architectures. However, security over network communications is vital when the whole system spreads to massive scales in networking, including data integrity and robustness over external malicious attacks, which would significantly affect the system’s overall modal training effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an ungraded version of the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) assisted Knowledge Distillation framework, aiming at leveraging the blockchain features on data security to solve the intrinsic robustness defects in a naive KD architecture and reducing overall processing time by adding a local blockchain layer. Our major contributions can be concluded as the following (1) a revised version Hybrid KD-NFT framework from our previously proposed State-of-the-art (SOTA) framework, which improves the overall effectiveness and reduces the overall latency when compared to its original version; (2) the proposal and implementation of a hybrid (combination of private and public chain) multi-layer blockchain architecture; and (3) conducting more sets of experiments and performing more comprehensive comparisons over existing other KD frameworks in more metrics to prove our proposed Hybrid KD-NFT framework is a valid work.}

The rapid expansion of e-auction enhances work efficiency but incurs some new and distinctive challenges such as low-robustness, data privacy, and lack of trust. To address the above concerns, various auction designs have been proposed by researchers from the academic and industrial circles. However, most of them fail in simultaneously achieving decentralization (i.e. auctioneer-free), privacy-preserving (i.e. bids privacy), collusion-resistance, and secure-channel free. In this paper, we present an effective smart contract-based verifiable privacy-preserving sealed-bid reverse auction scheme, which not only has no need for trusted third parties, but also achieves robustness and privacy protection of losing bids even in the face of overwhelming collusion. In this scheme, the central auctioneer is replaced with some carefully designed smart contracts for decentralization, while zero-knowledge proof and anonymous veto networks are used to avoid the secret communication channel, support the public verifiability and detect the malicious behaviors of bidders. More practically, the complexity of the designed scheme is independent of the number of bidders. Finally, we implement a prototype of our design based on a locally simulated Ethereum test network. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the scheme is the high efficiency and practicality.}

Instead, fan tokens tend to closely co-move with each other and the main cryptocurrencies used for buying them.

Crowdsensing frameworks utilize workers’ sensing capabilities to fulfill requesters’ sensing tasks. While crowdsensing is typically managed by a centralized platform, the centralized management entails various challenges such as reliability in workers’ selection, fair evaluation for payment distribution, potential breach of users’ privacy, and high deployment cost. The proposed solution, SenseChain, is a decentralized crowdsensing framework developed to run on Ethereum blockchain to mitigate said challenges while increasing users’ engagement, with reasonable cost. SenseChain is developed around three smart contracts: (1) User Manager Contract (UMC), (2) Task Manager Contract (TMC), and (3) Task Detailed Contract (TDC). These contracts implement the platform features such as maintaining users’ information, publishing tasks from multiple requesters, accepting reservations and solutions from multiple workers, and evaluating solutions to calculate proportional payments. The framework is implemented using Solidity and Web3.js, where a real publicly available dataset is used. The framework performance is compared to a centralized greedy selection framework to demonstrate its comparability while mitigating tackled challenges. The results in terms of solutions quality, time cost, and workers traveled distance confirm its viability as a solution for crowdsensing.}

Continuous authentication was introducing to be superior to traditional authentication schemes by constantly verify users’ identities on an ongoing basis and spot the moment at which an illicit attacker seizes control of the session. However, several challenges remain unsolved. This research aims to investigate the power of Blockchain technology to provide real-time and non-intrusive continuous authentication for the IoT environment. Accordingly, a distributed and scalable continuous authentication solution based on Blockchain technology called CAB-IoT was proposed. It enabled fog nodes layer that tackles the limitations of IoT resources by providing localized processing of heavy continuous authentication-related tasks for a group of IoT devices. Besides, CAB-IoT introduced a trust module that depends on the face recognition machine learning model to detect outliers and abnormal access. Moreover, mutual authentication between end-users and fog nodes is also designed, as well as secure communication between the authenticated nodes. The results demonstrate a lightweight continuous authentication solution that achieved the desired balance between security and performance requirements where it was observed in a real-world environment for truly performance results. Security analysis and attack analysis are also considered during the evaluation.}

In our approach, fully functional access control is provided to ensure that patients and medical institutions can control access to the data. This allows the user to promptly verify the integrity of the results after the search. Our approach also supports the addition, modification, and deletion of medical records, and it complies with the requirements of forward security.
