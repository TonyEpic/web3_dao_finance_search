abstract = {The arising awareness of drug safety has brought tremendous demands on improving traceability and transparency in the supply chain. Conventionally, centralized/distributed database-based traceability platforms are adopted by many drug companies to control drug quality and improve transparency levels. However, it is still challenging to link drug stakeholders into an information-sharing chain due to the potential data manipulations and interest conflicts. In this context, this paper proposes a unified five-layer Blockchain and Internet of Things-based smart tracking and tracing (BIoT3, in short) platform to provide a decentralized traceability solution in the drug supply chain. Following the five-layer blockchain platform architecture, a practical roadmap is provided for the drug industry to achieve blockchain design, development, application, and evaluation. Moreover, three core enabling components are presented: IoT-based drug identity management, on-chain & off-chain mechanism, smart contract-enabled drug services. According to the real data from collaborating companies, the feasibility and efficiency of the BIoT3 platform have been verified using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. The case study demonstrates that it not only gains useful insights into transaction sizes configuration for optimal blockchain performance, but also provides a feasible blockchain-based solution for drug traceability and visibility.}

abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have great potential in improving environmental sustainability. However, current charging infrastructures could not meet the heightening demand due to the rapid expansion of EVs. Sharing private charge posts with others during idle time, as a win–win solution for charge post owners and non-owner EV drivers, is a proactive response to the dilemma. To build a trusted environment for the peer-to-peer charge post rental service, we explore a blockchain-enabled sharing charging system with redesigned operating procedures and a tailored non-myopic charge post match strategy. The new system can leverage the advantages of blockchain in privacy-preserving and misbehavior-auditing while fully utilizing shared charging facilities. The proposed system model is validated on Ethereum, and test results suggest that the redesigned system can provide high quality services with affordable computational resource consumption. Moreover, the results also report that, compared to the myopic strategy, the non-myopic strategy can improve the overall matching successful rate of charging requests by considering the potential impact of each assignment, especially when charge post resources are scarce.}

Also, relying on third parties to trade in centralized systems is indispensable. Although current exist frameworks for these solutions in the supply chain, these have work poor traceability and lack of real-time information, and especially lack of privacy. In this article, we propose a framework for supply chain traceability that preserves privacy from third parties by using smart contracts. In the proposed framework, digital signature and verification are provided by using existing cryptographic techniques in off-chain and on-chain smart contract integration, and it is demonstrated the applicability of architecture by testing. The architecture also provides both anonymity and traceability depending on the user’s request. Finally, thanks to traceability and auditability in the proposed system, customers and other parties can view with a single product ID and also verify with digital signature the claims of the actors in the system.}

As a popular emergent technology, blockchain has several useful characteristics such as tamper proof, distributed data management, timestamp, asymmetric encryption, and smart contract. Built upon these characteristics, this paper develops a patent registration and trading system for improved information security, immutability, transparency, and traceability. This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process. Through these comparisons we show that the proposed blockchain-aided patent registration and trading system is effective in resolving several key patent protection challenges. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed to highlight the significance of our proposed method.}

Specifically, we focus on Polkadot, a protocol that aggregates preference lists from another set of actors, nominators, that contain a limited number of trusted validators and thereby influence the election’s outcome. This process is financially incentivized but often overwhelms human decision makers due to the problem’s complexity and the multitude of available alternatives. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) to help the nominators choose the validators in an environment with frequently changing data. The system structures the relevant multiple attribute problem and incorporates a dedicated active learning algorithm. Its goal is to find a sufficiently small set of pairwise elicitation questions to infer nominators’ preferences. We test the proposed solution in an experiment with 115 real nominators from the Polkadot ecosystem. The empirical results confirm that our approach outperforms the unaided process in terms of required interaction time, imposed cognitive effort, and offered efficacy. The developed DSS can be easily extended to other blockchain ecosystems.}

VSD can be considered as an overarching methodological framework for new technologies development which takes into account moral and human values of all the direct and indirect stakeholders which might be impacted by the technology. By considering the perspectives of the different involved stakeholders, the paper specifically addresses the call for more research about blockchain-based services which adopts a human-centred approach instead of technocentric. The paper is based on the empirical analysis of a DApp called BBBlockchain which was specifically created with the purpose to improve citizens participation in urban planning decisions in two major residential development projects in Berlin, Germany. BBBlockchain is a proof of concept which is currently running on its own in-house test network but it can run on every EVM compatible blockchain. From the analysis of the information layer of participation, it can be argued that the most important values include transparency, inclusiveness and confidentiality.}

For this purpose, health standards and semantic web technologies were used for the formal expression of both the insured individual's data and contract terms. Accordingly, a fine-grained data access policy was applied for evaluating contract terms on the basis of relevant data captured in healthcare settings. A prototype was implemented involving the development of several different smart contracts for the Ethereum platform as well as the necessary visual environment for accessing them. The developed system validates various features related to blockchain and smart contract features that are briefly discussed in this work, part of which can be mitigated or resolved through the use of a private permissioned blockchain. The application of well-established techniques for potential malfunctions of external services could also boost the security of the system and prevent it from potential attacks.}

Meanwhile, the security problem of the blockchain digital currency has become increasingly serious. It is necessary to build a provenance model for a large number of blockchain transaction, which can be used to find out which link has trouble and who is responsible once a problem occurs. However, the existing blockchain transaction data analysis methods have low traceback accuracy for data provenance. Therefore, a novel blockchain transaction provenance model with graph attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. The graph attention mechanism is used to identify the traders. Then, a triplet data structure is built to record provenance information and express the relationship between transaction amount and traders. Finally, the smart contract is used to implement the proposed provenance model. The provenance information can be searched through the interface provided by the smart contract when the traceback is required. In addition, the real large-scale Bitcoin transaction dataset Elliptic is used to compare the proposed method with other existing methods. The experiment show that the proposed method achieves state of the art results of the traceback accuracy.}

In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and four deep learning models with different data sets were established to identify the species of boletes. By comparison, the accuracy of the train set, test set and external verification can reach 100% about the synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) model, and the loss value of this model is 0.0257 which is close to zero. Therefore, the synchronous 2DCOS model has the best accuracy and generalization ability. Then, the results of species identification were uploaded to the blockchain platform that we build. Users can query and display the information after identity authentication, so as to realize the traceability of bolete mushrooms. The results show that our method is feasible. The traceability technology based on deep learning and blockchain has been used in the field of microbiology in this research, and it can be extended to other fields.}

This article exploits smart contracts in the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain platforms. In particular, we explore Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu, BFT blockchain platforms, and apply them to a decentralized e-prescription case study to evaluate their effectiveness. We adopt Hyperledger Besu and Tendermint in this research, given that both are BFT-based blockchains. Also, it is noteworthy that smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms such as Tendermint are not well established and not widely adopted yet. Our article empirically evaluates the performance of smart contracts in Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu using a decentralized medical prescription case study and compares their results with Ethereum, a PoW blockchain. Our results demonstrate that BFT blockchain platforms are efficient for multi-stakeholder applications such as e-prescription and supply chains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the implementation of smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms, such as Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu.}

It allows individuals, businesses, or organizations to present their projects, ideas, or causes to a global audience and request financial support from a crowd of potential backers. Crowdfunding has gained popularity across various industries, including technology, arts, entrepreneurship, social causes, and more. It provides a democratized approach to financing, allowing innovative and creative ideas to come to life with the support of a diverse community of backers. The current research explores the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts to revolutionize traditional crowdfunding methodologies. Traditional crowdfunding has been plagued by issues such as lack of transparency, centralized intermediaries, slow payment processing, fraud, and limited access. In response to these challenges, blockchain solutions offer a transparent and decentralized approach, allowing contributors to track their contributions, eliminate intermediaries, automate fund disbursement, and enable cross-border transactions. Tokenization and reduced entry barriers further enhance accessibility and participation. The current research presents a conceptual model and implementation of a smart contract-based crowdfunding system using Solidity, addressing these issues and providing a foundation for future research in the field of decentralized crowdfunding. The research scope has been expanded to encompass Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a means of fundraising for startups. Within this context, fungible tokens, which adhere to the ERC-20 standard, are generated using the OpenZeppelin library. These tokens are then subject to approval by the startup, granting authorization to a crowdfunding manager for the purpose of distributing tokens to contributors based on their respective contributions. The percentage of tokens made available for distribution can be customized to suit the specific needs and preferences of the startup.}

The cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing scheme has provided many benefits in recent years, but the centralization of the cloud raises challenges to privacy protection and data security. Blockchain technology is viewed as a possible solution to these challenges because of its unique properties of unforgeability, anonymity, and verifiability. Therefore, a blockchain based secure data outsourcing scheme is proposed in this paper. In the proposed scheme, each activity on outsourcing EHRs is recorded as a transaction on the public blockchain, authenticity is ensured by registration, and secure data access is ensured by keyword search. Initially, the EHR is encrypted by the proposed Enhanced Map Chaotic Encryption (EMCE) algorithm to ensure confidentiality. Then, data de-duplication is performed by the proposed Tri-Level Chunk Hashing (TL-CH) technique to eliminated duplicate records and reduce the storage space. Finally, the integrity of outsourced EHRs is validated by the Third-Party Auditor (TPA). The performance and security analysis show that the proposed scheme can provide solid security against various attacks, and the storage space is reduced.}

Furthermore, multigroup analysis (MGA) demonstrates how different contexts have distinct acceptance predictors. Depending on the context, perceived lower fees, perceived faster settlement, perceived income distribution, perceived fraudproof, and perceived traceability had varying significance. Meanwhile, perceived immutability, perceived process automation, and perceived transparency, even though considered appealing, were not significant in influencing acceptance.

While RT-PCR technology remains the most reliable method for detecting COVID-19, this approach is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, researchers have explored various machine learning and deep learning-based approaches to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases using X-ray images. Machine learning based models can reduce costs and have shorter processing times. However, preserving patient confidentiality poses challenges within such third-party-controlled systems, potentially failing to safeguard patients from potential disgrace and discomfort. Nonetheless, blockchain technology offers the potential to securely store sensitive medical data anonymously, without requiring third-party intervention. Consequently, the combination of deep learning and blockchain might offer a viable solution to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring patient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model of blockchain and deep learning model for automatically detecting COVID-19 using chest X-rays (CXR). The deep learning model includes a stacking ensemble of three modified pre-trained Deep Learning (DL) models: VGG16, Xception, and DenseNet169. The model obtained an accuracy of 99.10% and 98.60% for binary and multi-class respectively. Further, to ensure COVID-19 patients’ privacy and security, the Ethereum blockchain has been adopted to store information related to COVID-19 cases. In addition, a smart contract on the blockchain has been designed for handling X-ray images in the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).}

This data is processed by Service Providers in order to improve and develop new services and products, but also to fund themselves. However, processing personal data may result in the extraction of sensitive information, which, in turn, may lead to jeopardizing the users’ privacy. To mitigate this significant risk, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union elaborated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This regulation forces Service Providers to obtain Data Subjects’ explicit consent prior to collecting and processing their personal data. Nevertheless, the GDPR’s legislative text does not define how Service Providers must transparently demonstrate that they already have these consents. Moreover, most individuals do not know the rights they have over their personal data, neither does this regulation provide them with efficient methods to be aware of what third parties are doing with such data. In order to address this situation, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based GDPR-compliant personal data management platform. The new solution provides public access to immutable evidences that reflect the reached agreements between Data Subjects and Service Providers. In this way, Service Providers can effectively demonstrate that they are fulfilling the regulation, and Data Subjects are able to control and manage their personal data according to their legitimate rights. We have implemented the new system, and we have performed a detailed study which includes: GDPR-compliance, provided functionality, security and privacy issues, and the cost in terms of gas and US dollars of the different operations to be run on the blockchain.}

abstract = {Public auditing enables data owners to entrust a third-party auditor (TPA) to perform auditing tasks periodically. To resist malicious TPAs, a plethora of blockchain-based public auditing mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot effectively mitigate single point of failure and collusion between TPAs and miners. These schemes are burdened by significant wastage of storage resources due to the presence of redundant data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized auditing scheme supporting ciphertext deduplication (BDACD). BDACD leverages a decentralized blockchain, which takes over the role traditionally played by a centralized TPA. A decentralized autonomous organization is incorporated to enhance resistance against collusion attacks. By integrating advanced ciphertext deduplication techniques, BDACD effectively mitigates storage overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept, T-Merkle hash tree, along with a corresponding search algorithm. This innovation significantly enhances blockchain storage utilization and enables efficient half-interval searches within a block. To ensure accountability and fairness, a smart contract is employed to establish an arbitration mechanism. This mechanism serves a dual purpose: penalizing any malevolent actions by cloud servers and providing adequate compensation to data owners whose data integrity has been compromised. Detailed security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate BDACD has desirable security and efficiency.}

abstract = {Blockchain technology is widely used in the field of digital currency because of its non-tamperability, traceability, and decentralization. Blockchain’s private key is usually used to prove the ownership of the cryptocurrency. However, this private key managed by the blockchain wallet faces the challenge of secure storage. Once the private key is leaked or stolen, the user’s digital assets will be permanently lost. To solve the storage issue of the private key, we propose a novel approach based on facial biometrics and a physical unclonable function (PUF) device to generate a secure blockchain’s private key. Firstly, to protect user anonymity and enhance the security of the private key, a user’s facial biometrics is bound with a device’s PUF fingerprint to generate the trusted private keys online without being stored in a third-party server or an external device. Secondly, to prevent the leakage of sensitive data, we utilize the correctness and perfectness of secret sharing to protect the helper data to prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive information about the fusion template. Thirdly, we give the formal security proof of our proposed scheme and conduct the informal security analysis. The experiment results demonstrate our scheme achieves a better EER (Equal Error Rate) of 2.02% in terms of accuracy and takes about 1008ms to generate a private key in terms of efficiency. Moreover, our scheme can resist various attacks such as password guessing, stolen mobile device, user impersonation, physical and cloning, and information leakage attacks. Finally, we develop a blockchain wallet prototype without modifying the blockchain protocol to achieve transfer transactions for demonstrating the usability and security of our proposed approach in a real-world scenario.}

The rate of development and deployment has been one of the fastest to date. However, owing to the frenzy surrounding this illness, fraudulent entities have come up with fake vaccines to administer to citizens. In this chapter, we plan to propose a system, with the security and authenticity of the blockchain technology behind it, to maintain a vaccine supply chain so that benefactors may determine the authenticity of the product. The system solves the problem by maintaining a permissioned blockchain containing vaccine record transactions to create a vaccine supply chain. Fraudulent entities can be easily identified as all the transactions on a blockchain network are time stamped and immutable. A permissioned blockchain only allows valid participants through user identity management involving digital signatures for authentication. Hence, only registered suppliers and manufacturers can interact with the system. All operational data will be recorded in the ledger once the vaccine has been manufactured and transmitted from the producer to the vendor. Because all links in the chain can be determined at any time, the entire process of verifying the authenticity will be very simple. In this chapter, we shall discuss existing technology used and a blockchain-based solution for the problem.}

abstract = {In the present era of the pandemic, vaccination is necessary to prevent severe infectious diseases, i.e., COVID-19. Specifically, vaccine safety is strongly linked to global health and security. However, the main concerns regarding vaccine record forgery and counterfeiting of vaccines are still common in the traditional vaccine supply chains. The conventional vaccine supply chains do not have proper authentication among all supply chain entities. Blockchain technology is an excellent contender to resolve the issues mentioned above. Although, blockchain based vaccine supply chains can potentially satisfy the objectives and functions of the next-generation supply chain model. However, its integration with the supply chain model is still constrained by substantial scalability and security issues. So, the current blockchain technology with traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus is incompatible with the next-generation vaccine supply chain framework. This paper introduces a model named “VaccineChain” - a novel checkpoint-assisted scalable blockchain based secure vaccine supply chain. VaccineChain guarantees the complete integrity and immutability of vaccine supply records to combat counterfeited vaccines over the supply chain. The dynamic consensus algorithm with various validating difficulty levels supports the efficient scalability of VaccineChain. Moreover, VaccineChain includes anonymous authentication among entities to provide selective revocation. This work also consists of a use case example of a secure vaccine supply chain using checkpoint assisted scalable blockchain with customized transaction generation-rule and smart contracts to demonstrate the application of VaccineChain. The comprehensive security analysis with standard theoretical proofs ensures the computational infeasibility of VaccineChain. Further, the detailed performance analysis with test simulations shows the practicability of VaccineChain.}

Despite these efforts, the process of sharing students’ credentials is complex, error-prone and not completely secure. Our aim is to leverage blockchain technology to mitigate the existing security-related issues concerning the sharing of students’ credentials. Thus, the paper proposes a tamper-proof, immutable, authentic, non-repudiable, privacy protected and easy to share blockchain-based architecture for secured sharing of students’ credentials. To increase the scalability, the proposed system uses a secure off-chain storage mechanism. The performance and viability of the proposed architecture is analyzed by using an Ethereum based prototypical implementation. The test results imply that requests can be executed within few seconds (without block-time) and the system has stability to process up to 1000 simultaneous requests.}

The work proposes a framework addressing multiple challenges in traffic incident detection and evidence management like gathering of traffic event related evidence from multiple sources, addressing fault management in embedded vehicle on board units, resiliency from malicious event reporting and handling conflicting traffic incident event reports. The framework relies on a combination of cooperative event correlation and trust model to detect malicious and erroneous reporting of traffic incidents followed by Long Short term Memory (LSTM) and Bayesian model to resolve conflicting event reports. The events are correlated and verified before being transmitting onto the blockchain for evidence management and access control by various stakeholders. Analysis is presented highlighting the improvement in efficiency achieved by convergence of the multiple approaches proposed.}

Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting the above attacks, with acceptable performance.}

Most of the current crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) built on blockchain focus on solving privacy issues and use rigorous proof protocols for task and solution security. Such systems cannot be directly applied in mobile environments because it would lead to excessive computational overhead for the endpoint. To achieve confidentiality of crowdsourcing tasks during transmission while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices and optimizing task assignment results, in this paper, we develop a blockchain-based crowdsourcing model. We first build a model structure consisting of basic components, such as users, smart contracts, and blockchain, and design contracts to implement various crowdsourcing operations, such as registering, publishing tasks, and acquiring solutions. Unlike before, the ciphertext of the task and the encrypted secret key are embedded into the contract. This, together with the three operations we designed for users to interact with the smart contracts, can effectively protect the crowdsourcing data from being stolen while using the address anonymity of Ethereum to ensure the privacy of users. During task assignment, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to delineate each valid service area and implement the established multiobjective planning model within each area to achieve as many benefit goals as possible in the best way. Finally, we implement our prototype on the Ethereum test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that the cost overhead of the designed model is acceptable to mobile users, and the security analysis establishes the confidentiality of the designed operations.}

Because of this, videos cannot be famous across borders, and their viewership is limited to a single language and culture. The easiest way to solve this problem is to add subtitles in the language of the viewer. However, the current subtitling system lacks incentives, the ability to build a secure transaction environment, and a trusting relationship between video creators and subtitling makers. In response to the above situation, a tokenized subtitling crowdsourcing system (TSCS) based on blockchain and smart contract technologies is proposed. The source files for the subtitles are stored on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) in the proposed system. Based on the ERC-721 standard, the returned corresponding address and subtitling-related information are made into a non-fungible token (NFT). At the same time, depending on the expected revenue from video view counts, the video token (VT), based on the ERC-777 standard and endorsed by the video platform, will be used as the payment token. The TSCS has two payment strategies: one-time and dividend. Through such a settlement mechanism, the subtitling maker’s revenue is also guaranteed by the code invariance and rule certainty of smart contract deployment. On the other hand, introducing an incentive mechanism for viewers to audit subtitles enables community autonomy, thus increasing the applicability of subtitles and the activity of users.}

As an immediate benefit, it improves network reliability and latency by enabling data access and processing rapidly and efficiently near IoT devices. However, it comes with several issues stemming from the complexity, the security, the energy consumption, and the instability due to the decentralization of service localization. Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward. Blockchain has been envisioned to enforce trustworthiness in diverse IoT environments. However, high latency and high energy costs are incurred to process IoT transactions. This paper introduces a novel Blockchain-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to enable energy-aware task scheduling and offloading in an Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT network. The Asynchronous Actor–Critic Agent (A3C) DRL-based policy achieves efficient task scheduling and offloading. The latter is in symbiosis with Proof-of-Authority Blockchain consensus to validate IoT transactions and blocks. By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically. Carried out experiments put forth that our approach offers 50% better energy efficiency, which outperforms traditional consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work and PBFT, in terms of throughput and network latency and offers better scheduling performance.}

That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm.

However, with products becoming increasingly complex, they contain sub-assemblies with components that have sub-components supplied by different manufacturers. This creates a multi-tier supply chain that complicates the propagation of sustainability information necessary to compute the product's carbon emission due to the lack of oversight and potential loss of information from manufacturers in the multi-tier supply chain. Blockchain technology, characterized by its immutability, visibility, and traceability, is a promising medium to propagate sustainability information. Despite the fact that many papers have proposed a system that is viable for products with a multi-tier supply chain in the literature, we have not seen its proof-of-concept yet. This work first proposes a blockchain-enabled system that enables the propagation of environmental sustainability information in a multi-tier supply chain.

These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.}

Although the research benefits from data reuse are widely acknowledged, the data collections existing today are still kept in silos. Indeed, monitoring what happens to data once they have been handed to a third party is currently not feasible within the current data sharing practices. We propose a blockchain-based system to trace data collections and potentially create a more trustworthy data sharing process. In this paper, we present the LUCE (License accoUntability and CompliancE) architecture as a decentralized blockchain-based platform supporting data sharing and reuse. LUCE is designed to provide full transparency on what happens to the data after they are shared with third parties. The contributions of this work consist of i) the design of a decentralized data sharing solution with accountability and compliance by design and ii) the inclusion of a dynamic consent model for personalized data sharing preferences and for enabling legal compliance mechanisms. We test the scalability of the platform in a real-time environment where a growing number of users access and reuse different datasets. Compared to existing data sharing solutions, LUCE provides transparency over data sharing practices, enables data reuse, and supports regulatory requirements. The experimentation shows that the platform can be scaled for a large number of users.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of E-commerce, more and more people are used to shopping online, in which the reputation scores of sellers play an important role in helping consumers purchase satisfactory products. However, in the existing E-commerce environments, the reputation scores of users (including sellers and buyers) are centrally computed and stored on a centralized cloud server, which might make errors or even engage in fraud and forgery. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized reputation system (BC-DRS) in the E-commerce environment, i.e., online shopping. In this system, the product information including product descriptions and comments is stored in the interplanetary file system (IPFS) and the corresponding address is returned, and the returned address and the reputation scores of users are stored on the blockchain. The reputation evaluation is implemented by designing and deploying a smart contract on the blockchain. Different from the traditional centralized reputation systems (CRSs), the proposed BC-DRS can protect the product information and users reputation scores from intentional and unintentional modifications, since it is very hard to change any data stored in the blockchain and IPFS. Also, as the reputation scores of users are computed and updated by all the ratings of their transactions weighted by the practical transaction factors, it is effective to resist the common attacks, i.e., unfair rating and collusion. In addition, this system also contains a monetary incentive mechanism for the evaluation, which is helpful to form a virtuous circle in online shopping. The proposed BC-DRS is simulated on the popular blockchain platform, i.e., Ethereum with Solidity language. The experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed BC-DRS has desirable usability and reliability.}

For example, a compromised CA can issue illegal or fake certificates for any domains, and a CA can issue unauthorized certificates without the consent of the domain owner. In addition, some high-value target domains, such as banks and government agencies may have been frequently attacked, and the adversaries can launch the targeted attacks by making use of the disclosure of the issuing CAs. To address these pressing issues or challenges, in this work, we propose a novel blockchain-based PKI framework using linkable ring signatures, called LRS_PKI. Specially, we propose a novel certificate issuance mechanism that utilizes linkable ring signatures to hide the issuing CA, so as to reduce the risk of the PKI system being attacked. Additionally, we introduce the blockchain as a public log to record the certificate operations, and adopt the decentralized storage IPFS to store the certificates to decouple the blockchain layer and storage layer. In order to prevent the CA from issuing unauthorized certificates, we have added a condition to verify whether the issuing CA is consistent with the previous issuing CA in the certificate verification. The security analysis and experimental results show that LRS_PKI is both secure and efficient.}

However, due to the heterogeneity of edge devices and the diversity of data sources, traditional access control methods cannot meet the requirements of the large-scale, distributed, dynamic and flexible expansion of edge intelligence applications. Therefore, this paper studies the fine-grained data access control method on the basis of smart contracts, and implements the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model through smart contracts. To improve the query efficiency of attributes and policies in the process of access request decision, an attribute management scheme is designed on the basis of the Bloom filter to achieve fast retrieval of attributes and policies. The decentralized fine-grained access control method is tested under the performance indicators such as retrieval delay, deployment delay, rule reduction rate and decision response time.}

In this study, unlike the existing literature, a blockchain-based solution is developed for local cargo networks. With this approach using Ultra High Radio Frequency (UHF-RFID), Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain-based smart contracts, a fast shipping management architecture that ensures security between the parties is provided. In this context, an automatic payment and approval mechanism is established between the parties using ethereum-based smart contracts.

The necessity of charity donations traceability system is inevitable to overcome such concerns, which have an adverse impact on doners’ trust in the donation process. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based donation traceability framework intended to enable all involved parties to trace the progress of charity donations from the moment they are given by donors to the moment they reach the intended recipients. The system is built on a public-permissioned blockchain on the Ethereum platform, with every transaction being recorded as a block in the chain. These blocks of information are immutable and visible to all parties, and they also enable timely and traceable transactions. The proposed framework’s effectiveness is evaluated using a hybrid qualitative approach and proves to improve the traceability of charity donations overcoming the uncertainty associated with current systems.}

MiC offers a range of benefits including cost-effectiveness, high productivity, and high sustainability for construction industry.

However, stakeholders are facing challenges to share information throughout MiC projects. “Islands of Information” issue is commonly existing and creates information fragmentation and discontinuity. As an emerging Information and Communication Technology (ICT), blockchain provides unified standards and protocols for information sharing based on decentralized P2P framework with enhanced transparency and security. Aiming to address the information fragmentation and discontinuity in MiC project, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical smart MiC platform to facilitate cross-enterprise information sharing among multiple stakeholders based on User-Centered Design (UCD) method. A practical roadmap is presented for the design, development, deployment, and application of MiC blockchain with new opportunities and guidelines. Initial investigations based on an industrial collaborated company are analyzed and the blockchain-enabled cyber-physical MiC workflow is designed. The user-centered blockchain explorers with high-fidelity digital twins are illustrated. Some preliminary results are found that MiC blockchain not only facilitates cyber-physical construction progress traceability, and real-time KPI visualization & evaluation, but also improves the information reliability, immutability, and transparency in MiC projects.}

The proposed research aims at attaining several objectives. To start with, it assesses the limitations associated with the current electronic prescription systems. Accordingly, it proposes a proactive method for providing real-time monitoring to prevent overdose prescriptions. The proposed approach should ensure that health providers have access to a comprehensive dataset without state or geographical limitations. More importantly, the research aims to improve drug monitoring to enhance accountability and trust, which are central to promoting drug legitimacy.
Methods
A blockchain-based framework for secure, interoperable, and efficient access to prescription records. The proposed solution, SecureRx, is a web-based application developed on the Ethereum blockchain and RxCheck hub.
Results
Based on the evaluation results, SecureRx is functional as it allows health providers to verify patient history and make informed decisions regarding whether to prescribe opioids. The proposed solution exhibits adequate scalability and handles transactions quickly when the number of nodes is reduced. It is also robust and secure, supports HIPAA compliance, and requires minimal operational expenses.
Conclusions
The safe utilization of medications, especially opioids, continues to be a major problem in the United States and around the world. Part of the reason for this is the inability of health providers to access health databases for patients. Current drug prescription systems are limited in terms of tracking the usage of prescription drugs. The SecureRx framework has highlighted the potential of the record-keeping technology to nurture effective and efficient sharing of information about prescriptions while ensuring the safety and privacy of the original sources of the data.}

First, we conceptualize a technical architecture to connect blockchain to digital building twins. The digital building twin stores and evaluates performance data in real-time. The blockchain ensures transparency and trusted execution of automatic performance evaluation and rewards through smart contracts. Next, we demonstrate the feasibility of both the concept and technical architecture by integrating the Ethereum blockchain with digital building models and sensors via the Siemens building twin platform.

Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data’s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.}

To facilitate the system framework design and implementation for CSM, this study proposes a generic Cyber-physical Centered (CCD) Design, illustrating an effective and systematic approach to identify user-activity relationships in a cross-collaborative context. The consideration of entity, value chain and user-activity relationships facilitate identity management and value chain management services. The proposed approach was then utilized to a pilot project to design and implement the Blockchain-enabled Cyber-physical Site Management System (BCSMS) integrated with Digital Work Supervision System (DWSS), incorporating considerations on multi-source information flow and user-centric applications design. The implemented BCSMS decentralized two types of fundamental documents in CSM - Request for Inspection and Survey Checking (RISC) form and site diary. It addresses information fragmentation and asymmetry in a cross-collaborative environment caused by manual-input and error-prone records. The proposed system was evaluated by two important system performance indicators in terms of average response time and transaction per second. The system performance test shows that the accountability of BCSMS is significant compared to DWSS, given the p-value 0.01. Blockchain effectively improves DWSS with enhanced data submission, identity management and data-driven site performance evaluation functions. This study also qualitatively analyzed the pros and cons of proposed blockchain-enabled cyber-physical system (CPS) from society-economy-technology aspects for technical practitioners, construction stakeholders and governments.}

It is then elaborated how a blockchain-enabled token economy can efficiently and transparently incentivize and coordinate an integrative and community-inclusive participatory approach to fuel crowdsourcing of collective intelligence for contributing ideas, work, infrastructure, funding, data, validation, management, assessment, governance, arbitration and exploitation of projects. Quality, credibility and direction of projects are optimized by demanding collateral “skin-in-the-game” from contributors based on blockchain-enabled staking, reputation systems and prediction markets. This way research progress emerges as a chain of community generated and independently vetted blocks of scientific knowledge; these new blocks are concatenated with the state-of-the-art according to transparent consensus mechanisms.}

To address the above challenges, we propose a Blockchain and Signcryption enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning (BSAFL) framework based on dual aggregation for asynchronous cross-domain federated learning scenarios. In particular, we first design two types of signcryption schemes to secure the interaction and access control of collaborative learning between domains. Second, we construct a differential privacy approach that adaptively adjusts privacy budgets to ensure data privacy and local models' availability of intra-domain user. Furthermore, we propose an asynchronous aggregation solution that incorporates consensus verification and elastic participation using blockchain. Finally, security analysis demonstrates the security and privacy effectiveness of BSAFL, and the evaluation on real datasets further validates the high model accuracy and performance of BSAFL.}

abstract = {With the increasing integration of distributed generators and the rapid development of electricity markets, active distribution networks (ADNs) confront new challenges in operation optimization. Centralized optimization methods usually aggravate the computational burden when applied to large-scale distribution networks (DNs). A distributed operation optimization model incorporating peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading in a blockchain environment is proposed in this paper, where network usage fees considering electrical distance are specially addressed. Meanwhile, the private information security of prosumers is ensured by the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus blockchain during P2P electricity trading. The trading information of adjustable prosumers should be sent to the proxy entity authorized by the DN using the blockchain platform. In addition, a network partitioning method via dynamic reconfiguration considering multi-level switching is offered to adapt to the required distributed manner. The operation network, as well as the corresponding market structure can be automatically updated according to the results of dynamic reconfiguration. Moreover, the unit price of network usage fees can be adjusted to derive a higher amount of P2P electricity trading with security constraints. Case studies on a practical 148-bus system and a 297-bus system verify that the proposed model maximizes the profits and reduces the computational time in the distributed operation optimization.}

abstract = {Protecting private data in smart homes, a popular Internet-of-Things (IoT) application, remains a significant data security and privacy challenge due to the large-scale development and distributed nature of IoT networks. Recently, smart healthcare has leveraged smart home systems, thereby compounding security concerns in terms of the confidentiality of sensitive and private data and by extension the privacy of the data owner. However, proof-of-authority (PoA)-based blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a promising solution for protecting private data from indiscriminate use and thereby preserving the privacy of individuals residing in IoT-enabled smart homes. This review elicits some concerns, issues, and problems that have hindered the adoption of blockchain and IoT (BCoT) in some domains and suggests requisite solutions using the aging-in-place scenario. Implementation issues with BCoT were examined as well as the combined challenges BCoT can pose when utilised for security gains. The study discusses recent findings, opportunities, and barriers, and provides recommendations that could facilitate the continuous growth of blockchain applications in healthcare. Lastly, the study explored the potential of using a PoA-based permission blockchain with an applicable consent-based privacy model for decision-making in the information disclosure process, including the use of publisher-subscriber contracts for fine-grained access control to ensure secure data processing and sharing, as well as ethical trust in personal information disclosure, as a solution direction. The proposed authorisation framework could guarantee data ownership, conditional access management, scalable and tamper-proof data storage, and a more resilient system against threat models such as interception and insider attacks.}

abstract = {Many smart applications, including smart cities, healthcare, smart agriculture, manufacturing, etc., have widely adopted the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart Farming (SF) integrates a set of technologies, such as cloud and edge computing and greenhouse concepts, to improve agricultural processes. Due to its capacity to generate fresh agricultural products at an incredible pace of development and output, the greenhouse business has recently attracted the attention of the farming community. However, the cost of labor and energy consumption causes the greenhouse’s production cost to rise by roughly 40%–50%. To avoid this, SF concepts have been introduced. Data management in SF has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its high potential for more accurate and cost-effective agriculture. Traditional client–server and cloud-based data management systems are plagued by single faults, data protection, centralized data management, and system vulnerabilities. In this paper, an IoT-based framework is proposed for SF to improve the productivity of crops. AI-based precision model is introduced in the framework, which can be integrated with remote sensor data for correct prediction of crop growth in smart agriculture. The result shows that the random forest model works better with 97% accuracy compared to Support Vector Classifier (SVC) have 93%, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) have 90%, and Logistic Regression 84%. This technology helps to reduce costs while also improving the overall quality of the agricultural process and product management with blockchain-based supply chain management to enhance farmers’ economic backdrop. The blockchain performance is evaluated on gas consumption, execution time, throughput and latency.}

However, existing centralized MCS applications that use servers for task publishing and data collection exhibit common problems, such as single points of failure and security vulnerabilities. Accordingly, we proposed a hybrid blockchain-based identity authentication scheme for MCS called HBIA, which uses blockchain technology to resolve the single-point failure problem. HBIA builds a cluster structure based on factors such as geographical location and balance, and uses it to construct a hybrid blockchain, with the cluster head node and internal cluster node authenticating on the public and private chains, respectively. We also implemented zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to ensure the privacy of participants’ identities, thus balancing the contradiction between blockchain transparency and security. In addition, HBIA uses the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) technology to enable off-chain computing and on-chain verification, further reducing the blockchain’s workload. Finally,​ HBIA was evaluated based on the pavement crack detection task and tested on the Ethereum public test network known as Ropsten. The test results indicate that the identity authentication scheme proposed in this paper is superior to existing schemes in terms of authentication time.}

abstract = {The management of construction projects requires adequate techniques to support the continual exchange of information across disciplines. Recent advances in Building Information Modelling (BIM) have exposed new ways for process and data integration with open data formats, process mapping, and terminology. In construction projects where multiple disciplines produce and share BIM data, mechanisms for defining information priority, provenance and suitability become necessary in order to have consistent and traceable use of data. This includes objects or collection of attributes for data objects that are associated with a discipline or organisation including clear identification of the transaction that has introduced the information. Blockchain can be used to record metadata of BIM objects such as the issuing discipline, object version and responsibility/ liability associated with the data. Blockchain can offer the capability to apply levels of “trust” to individual BIM objects and a more secured framework of collaboration across stakeholders. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based BIM data provenance model to support information exchange in construction projects. By testing the solution in a real-world bridge construction scenario, it has been shown that the approach can recognise the levels of competence and can improve the process of BIM implementation. The proposed approach gives stakeholders more confidence when sharing their BIM data, reduces costs, and improves risk contingencies in construction projects. The paper provides a cost analysis to evidence the implications of using Blockchain for BIM data provenance through an experimental framework supported by an Ethereum public test network. A front-end web page has also been created to facilitate interaction with smart contracts and to monitor the BIM data provenance process.}

abstract = {Confidentiality, availability, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation when together became the top priority for secure communication. However, authentication is the first line of defense in all these security parameters. Unfortunately, several authentication mechanisms in the traditional methods cannot provide secure communication due to various vulnerabilities such as single point of failure and privacy issues. Furthermore, key distribution mechanisms such as Certificate Authority (CA) and Trusted Third Party (TTP) distribute keys over the central architecture fail, thus secure communication cannot occur. As a solution to these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new decentralized blockchain-based identity authentication mechanism for VoIP networks, VoIPChain. The proposed scheme utilizes the main features of the blockchain platform, such as immutability, transparency, and fault tolerance, to provide data privacy and secure communication in VoIP applications. The proposed scheme is evaluated as an actual implementation using the virtual Ethereum platform and Python language. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is an efficient and cost-effective solution for the call process as a decentralized identity authentication system in VoIP. In addition, end-to-end secure call performance outperforms the existing blockchain-based authentication mechanisms by 30%–70% in terms of average time delay. The proposed scheme is almost ten times faster than the TLS process to authenticate between parties. Moreover, compared to fast but less secure basic methods over the SIP authentication the proposed scheme has an acceptable time delay in a call process.}

Blockchain technology, with its native constructs, such as shared ledger, smart contracts, and tokens, is deemed promising to alleviate these concerns. Hence, this study introduces a blockchain-enabled cyber-physical traceability system for logistics financing based on digital asset tokenization. The tokenization of digital assets brings visibility and traceability into the supply chain’s cyber (information flow) and physical (logistics flow) transactions. Subsequently, we (i) introduce the design and implementation of the proposed traceability system and (ii) demonstrate the application of the proposed system in logistics financing. Some of the resulting implications include: (i) The information sharing through blockchain technology brings resolution into the operations in the supply chain for logistics financing. (ii) The system minimizes the required upfront expenditure and provides flexible access to computing resources to promote the system’s adoption by the stakeholders.}

The GDPR is a privacy law giving European Union (EU) citizens authority over personal data. It enforces software systems to collect, analyze, and share only necessary information (‘data minimization’) following the specific purpose (‘consent’). The GDPR defines consent as permission of individuals (‘data subjects’) to give organizations (‘data controllers’) processing their personal data. Without a data subject's consent, the data controller processes personal data unlawfully. Therefore, consent management is an essential component of a software system to build data subjects' trust and engagement. However, sharing data can lead to a potential loss of control over personal data, as data are across boundaries between software services. One of the significant risks is caused by a lack of developers' experience in data protection practices. Hence, in this paper, we propose to use blockchain technology to manage data subjects' informed consent for data sharing to build trust, transparency, and traceability to share data across software services. We formalized the semantics of smart contracts to extend the blockchain features to validate the consent authorization and manage the request-response interaction between the services. Furthermore, we used the Event-B method to describe the dynamic behavior of the proposed model and prove its correctness. Finally, we provided a mapping from the formal model to a smart contract class diagram and a prototype called SmartDataTrust implemented with solidity and Python REST API that developers can easily utilize.}

Blockchain is a promising technique to maintain product traceability in the agricultural food supply chain. The paper proposes a framework which uses the concept of blockchain smart contracts. All the entities engaged in the blockchain-based supply chain network handle the transaction between parties. All transactions are recorded to maintain high transparency and traceability across the supply chain ecosystem. In the event of abuse detection, a group signature mechanism is used. Three metrics, transaction efficiency, system risk reduction, and trust between participants, are considered for testing the system’s overall performance. After implementing the framework, the transaction efficiency is measured in terms of gas cost, average execution time, throughput and latency. These parameters show the satisfactory system performance.}

Centralized crowdsourcing frameworks complement workers’ reputations with predicted behavior, through Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve the task allocation performance and maintain worker engagement. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks allocate tasks to workers using reputation solely, which neglects the impact of a task’s context on the worker’s behavior. Our contribution is an on-chain behavior prediction ML model for task allocation on top of a proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. The ML model, hosted on blockchain, reflects a worker’s unique behavior for a task given its context. The proposed ML model is: (1) trained off-chain since it has lower monetary cost compared to on-chain training, and (2) deployed on-chain as a smart contract to enable transparent predictions. The task allocation mechanism in the proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework considers workers’ predicted behavior and a Quality of Information (QoI) metric that includes distance to the task, completion time, and workers’ reputation. The evaluation conducted confirms that the proposed task allocation mechanism, implemented using Solidity, outperforms the benchmark in terms of percentage of allocation, workers’ QoI, and reputation change.}

Blockchain has gained significant attention among researchers worldwide, which is evident from the extensive literature generated on this subject within a span of a few years. Through this paper, the authors attempt to showcase the immense scope and significance of blockchain in FSCs by examining and analyzing the existing studies. In addition to providing an overview of the application of blockchain in FSCs, this study also discusses challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and high cost and suggests potential solutions for the existing difficulties in adopting blockchain in FSCs.

However, most e-auction schemes involve a trusted auctioneer, which is not always credible in practice. Some studies have applied cryptography tools to solve this problem by distributing trust, but they ignore the existence of collusion. In this paper, a blockchain-based Privacy-Preserving and Collusion-Resistant scheme (PPCR) for double auctions is proposed by employing both cryptography and blockchain technology, which is the first decentralized and collusion-resistant double auction scheme that guarantees bidder anonymity and bid privacy. A two-server-based auction framework is designed to support off-chain allocation with privacy preservation and on-chain dispute resolution for collusion resistance. A Dispute Resolution agreement (DR) is provided to the auctioneer to prove that they have conducted the auction correctly and the result is fair and correct. In addition, a Concise Dispute Resolution protocol (CDR) is designed to handle situations where the number of accused winners is small, significantly reducing the computation cost of dispute resolution. Extensive experimental results confirm that PPCR can indeed achieve efficient collusion resistance and verifiability of auction results with low on-chain and off-chain computational overhead.}

However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as “BDSDT” is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99% using both datasets.}

Many systems for sustainable economic development are now relying on a digital form making them more accessible and provides the access to new functionalities. A very interesting example of such systems are complementary currencies i.e. cooperative currency systems that support national economies to provide humanitarian aid and promote sustainable development. While there are many studies on the principles and case studies of successful complementary currencies, many aspects are still unexplored, especially regarding cooperative behavior. Cooperative behavior in these systems is a key aspect, as complementary currencies are often born out of cooperation among members that face a period of crisis or they usually have the objective of creating bonds of reciprocity and integrating social networks between people, which should lead to increased cooperation. However, there is a lack of studies on many aspects of cooperative behavior in complementary currencies, such as how such behavior changes over time, especially in times of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover how cooperation behavior is affected by time and different geographical locations is still unclear. In this work, we analyze Sarafu, a complementary currency that went digital and now relies on blockchain technology. Sarafu is a successful case of a complementary currency that was used for humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, Sarafu is a perfect case study for the study of cooperative behavior, as it implements a special type of account, the group account, to support cooperation groups. This feature supports the study of group dynamics and behavior. What we find is that Sarafu users exhibit strong reliance on cooperation groups; we also observe that the interaction of users and cooperation groups is influenced by both time and geographical location. The study of group accounts and in general mechanisms that promote cooperation can be useful for other humanitarian or community development projects. Moreover, similar cooperation enhancers could have an important role in other social development projects, and in general, in any setting where there is a strong need to foster cooperation for reaching social good.}

In Industry 5.0, attackers can take advantage of the hidden dangers of information transmission among infrastructure, such as smart factories (SF) and intelligent manufacturing equipment (IME), to steal private data, endanger personal safety, and harm the interests of factories. In order to avoid the above phenomenon, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trusted interactive architecture for intelligent manufacturing equipment (BTIA-IME) based on the device layer of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). First, we design the key management smart contract (KMSC) and equipment management smart contract (EMSC) based on Elgamal to implement the IME trusted authentication mechanism that does not require three-party verification to ensure the credibility of IME in SF. Then, we design the data management smart contract (DMSC) based on Elgamal to store the privacy data structure through the “Blockchain-(InterPlanetary File System) IPFS” on-chain and off-chain storage modes to ensure the distributed and trusted storage of private data. After that, an access control list is constructed with the shared private data as the main body to implement the trusted access method of private data to ensure trusted access to private data. Finally, we perform simulation experiments on the proposed architecture. Theoretical and simulation experiments have proved that our proposed architecture is feasible.}

Health data sharing is a crucial component of health data utilization, yet it encounters serious privacy and security challenges. How to solve the problem of data security is the key factor to encourage users to participate, and existing data sharing methods generally have the problem of single point of failure. Based on this, this paper proposes a hybrid blockchain based health data sharing method HSHB, which divides sharing transactions into private chain data sharing and alliance chain data sharing according to different sharing entities. According to the identity and access purpose of different entities, HSHB has constructed the health data access control policy HDAC to avoid sharing interference among different entities. By building a b+ tree index of health data, HSHB provides users with an efficient and stable query scheme for historical health data. In addition, agent re-encryption and smart contract technology are used to share health data among institutions while ensuring the security of health data. Finally, the HSHB scheme is tested on XuperChain. The experimental results show that the health data sharing scheme HSHB proposed in this paper has advantages in computing overhead, throughput, and latency.}

The humanitarian sector has emerged as a powerful mechanism of legitimation for blockchain technology. Platform developers in the aid sector have been eager to showcase the promise of decentralization and encrypted blockchain data as the inheritance of the world’s poor and developing nations. This article claims that humanitarian blockchain projects are inextricably linked to the politics of the crypto-economy, proprietary platforms, and a class of solutionists championing Silicon Valley’s cultural values. Blockchain humanitarianism has emerged through a private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector that embraces tech disruption and innovation. Ethically sound blockchain humanitarian projects are precluded by the inherent obscurantism of the technology, the inability to transpose blockchain’s governance logic in the social realm, and inextricable ties to the political economy of cryptocurrencies. Projects in the developing world have thus embodied a colonial logic of techno-experimentation for platform developers and imbricate the NGO sector into the PR logic of blockchain solutionism.}

It has been anticipated as a key enabler for various domains of applications such as health care, automotive, agriculture, industrial operations, automation, energy, and the next generation of living. However, the current IoT applications face significant challenges in terms of the huge amount of collected data, intensive data exchange, security, privacy, centralized processing, and interoperability. To mitigate many of these issues, blockchain has been identified as a promising innovative technology. Blockchain, in conjunction with smart contracts, has received significant attention both from the industry and academia and offers features such as irreversibility, non-repudiation, proof of provenance, fault tolerance, pseudonymity, decentralized operations and decision-making, and distributed ledger. The integration of blockchain with IoT requires essential insights concerning the application areas, scalability, security, privacy, data college and storage, performance, and governance. Thus, this paper intends to expound on the opportunities and key aspects of using blockchain in the IoT landscape. Specifically, this paper surveys the utilization of blockchain for various IoT applications. Besides, the paper distinguishes different technical aspects and presents the associated research challenges. At last, future research directions are discussed depending on the lessons learned.}

This study suggests that PPGISs should be developed as decentralized applications (DApp) based on Ethereum blockchain technology to have a fully open, transparent, and accountable environment for public participation. In a blockchain-based PPGIS, the collected data are securely saved on the blockchain. The validity of the data, replicated on the nodes of the peer-to-peer blockchain network, is ensured through a consensus process without any central control. The data is tamper-free and immutable. Additionally, the data is openly accessible to institutions and citizens. A prototype PPGIS was developed as a DApp through which users can participate in the site selection of urban facilities. Using the application, they compare and rank different criteria. The system solves an analytic hierarchy process to calculate the weights of the criteria. A suitability map is generated afterward and published to be used by both citizens and decision-makers. The feasibility of the application, along with the issues that need to be considered while using blockchain technology for urban planning and development, are thoroughly discussed.}

This paper uses Blockchain technology to develop a system where customers can validate a product legitimacy without the need of a corresponding merchant. This system will be able to be used by manufacturers and companies to ensure that their products will be harder to counterfeit, therefore they will gain more trust from customers. The Ethereum blockchain is used to build the proposed model that is capable of tracing every item's creation and transactions, ensuring the credibility of an item's genuineness.

Developing smart contract methods is more difficult than mainstream software development as the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. We report on a new approach to developing smart contracts with the objective of automating the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce the risk of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into the processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.}

In peer-to-peer (P2P) trading of energy within the microgrid (MG), the peers can trade energy without the need for an intermediary. Blockchain technology is devised to assure the security and resilience of the system's P2P trading against adversarial attacks. The large number of renewable prosumers who participate in trading raises the MG system's oscillation frequency. To regulate the system frequency during trading, a distributed-based federated learned fractional-order recurrent neural network (FL-FORNN) adaptive controller is proposed. The control system is a crucial component of MGs in order to ensure stable performance. To aggregate the network weights, the proposed FL-based controller frequently communicates with the cloud server. To avoid the privacy threat during this case, we further propose to integrate FL with local differential privacy (LDP) to secure against the false data injection attack from the eavesdropper. To validate, the MG model is implemented in OPAL-RT with its resilient controller. The P2P trading of energy in the blockchain is executed in Raspberry Pis (RPis) based on the numerous prosumers/consumers participating in the trading. Then, the power information from the tertiary control implemented in RPis is communicated with the MG secondary frequency controller by interfacing using the user datagram protocol. The proposed work is realized for the MG considering four prosumers and three consumers, and the resiliency of the controller is authenticated with case studies. The results divulge that the LDP of the proposed controller can provide a robust and secure solution of MGs with P2P trading, even in the presence of adversarial attacks.}

The well-defined structural hierarchy of managing organizations in a smart city face several data management issues. The integration of emerging technologies, such as (IoT), has introduced more complexity to data maintenance in the smart city. At present, cloud-based information systems have become the norm for managing IoT data. Due to the centralized administrative control, the cloud-based information management is untrusted. Hence, it fails to guarantee the integrity of IoT data and traceability of operations to achieve transparency within the smart city organizations. Adoption of blockchain-based information systems can be viable solution to address these challenges. However, it introduces a new challenge of interoperability of transactions among different smart city organizations. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized hierarchy of blockchains, named Blockchain-of-Blockchains (BoBs), for ensuring data integrity and blockchain interoperability at the same time.

Numerous quantitative parameters determine the performance of BPs, alongside qualitative parameters indicating their performance. In this study, the aim is to determine the performance of BPs based on both qualitative and quantitative parameters. Within this scope, a multi-criteria decision-making approach and interval-valued spherical fuzzy (IVSF) sets are adopted. IVSF sets are utilized to determine expert importance levels. The IVSF-criteria importance assessment (CIMAS) method is introduced for the weighting of criteria. IVSF-CIMAS enables the determination of reliability levels in calculating criterion weights. The IVSF-simple weighted sum product (WISP) method is formulated to obtain the performance ranking of BPs. Thus, in this research, the IVSF-CIMAS-WISP hybrid model is developed, and an algorithm for this novel decision-analytic model is presented. A case study is developed focusing on BP selection for a digital project to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed hybrid model. The robustness of IVSF-CIMAS-WISP is tested through extensive sensitivity analysis scenarios. According to the research results, the applicability of the IVSF-CIMAS-WISP hybrid method is supported and its robustness is confirmed.

In the example, agents contract each other to provide services upon the payment of a dealt value through a system based on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

Collaboration is interesting and important in connecting the digital context with the physical world (IoT) to feed processes with data or send data.

Fraud detection is crucial for many type of organisations that deal with B2B transactions (banking, fintech, health, etc.) and are therefore exposed to a high risk of fraud. Fraud detection requires expensive professional investigations and intensive collaboration between processes of different organisations. This issue could be mitigated by effectively managing digital evidence, fostering trust and ensuring security for various stakeholders involved in the business processes. This paper proposes an approach to modelling and deploying any collaborative business process scenario, ensuring trust, security, and data privacy. Collaboration-level agreements are defined as a means to ensure trust, security, and data privacy. To accomplish this, our approach enables the automatic generation Smart Contract templates for the collaboration-level agreement specification involving different stakeholders in the collaboration. The Smart contracts are deployed in a Blockchain to ensure that the collaboration-level agreement conditions are signed by the parties. To validate the feasibility of our approach, a proof-of-concept for a fraud detection scenario is implemented, where different metrics are tested in relation to a set of threats and vulnerabilities.}

The framework allows data sharing, where requesters can subscribe to an existing data request (task) if their requirements match. Otherwise, they can create a new task with specific requirements on considered parameters. Incorporating the publish–subscribe (pub–sub) service model in a decentralized MCS system saves system entities’ sensing and computing resources and the cost of acquiring the data by the requesters. However, the pub–sub service model makes the curse of sensing issues more severe. Pub-SubMCS handles the curse of sensing issues by performing access control using smart contracts, which impose restrictions on data collectors (workers) to publish the data and identify and penalize the malicious workers early. To ensure data privacy and validation simultaneously over blockchain, we perform data transformation enabling the validation algorithm to run over transformed data and thus enhancing trust among the system entities. In particular, we use the normalization technique to transform data and the Pearson correlation coefficient measure to compare the similarity in the collected sensor data. Pub-SubMCS is implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, and solidity programming language is used to create smart contracts. The security analysis and experiment results show the proposed system’s scalability, usability, and feasibility. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the publish–subscribe model against the requester–worker model.}

abstract = {Recent advances in today’s Internet introduced huge demand for End-to-End Quality of Service (E2E QoS) assurances for delivering different types of traffic (video, live streaming, and telemedicine), originating from a wide spectrum of applications. Such applications stretch across multiple administrative domains and require fair and robust coordination for E2E QoS provisioning. While the selection of trusted domains is of paramount importance for the successful realization of E2E QoS, the issue of domain’s trust while finding E2E QoS paths has not been actively explored in the existing works. Trust awareness reduces the risk of violating QoS and improves the confidence of operating QoS across multiple domains. However, identifying trusted domains, finding the source of trust, and quantifying trust are the major challenges for enabling trust aware E2E QoS routing. Auditability of QoS implementation results at each domain forms a vital source for verifying QoS compliance and subsequently evaluating the trust of the domain. However, securely obtaining logs from the domains and identifying the accountability of domains for E2E QoS, without relying on a third party introduces significant difficulty when evaluating domain trust with respect to QoS compliance. This work proposes Trust aware E2E QoS Routing (TRAQR) framework for provisioning E2E QoS with trust and verifying the QoS compliance in Multi-Domain Software Defined Networks (MD-SDN). TRAQR efficiently leverages the tamper-proof and decentralized properties of Blockchain to store and exchange different kinds of trust information required to provision and verify E2E QoS compliance of the domains. This work developed a proof of concept implementation of the TRAQR in an MD-SDN environment emulated using Mininet, RYU SDN controller, Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to demonstrate the performance and benefits of TRAQR. Further, the simulations showed that the domain trust parameter introduced significant improvement in QoS compliance, even in the presence of untrusted domains.}

abstract = {Financial institutions are following an open banking (OB) trend for service innovation and integration. OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.}

That is, blockchain provides a trustworthy and decentralized data infrastructure for AI, and AI helps blockchain perform tasks requiring intelligence. Since these special SCs designed for blockchain-based AI tasks have different characteristics from the widely studied SCs designed for business logic, we name them Intelligent Contracts (ICs) for a focused study. In this paper, we systematically analyze ICs and propose a constructive framework for their construction and application. Specifically, we first formulate two construction modes of current ICs, including encoding AI models and scheduling AI collaboration. Then, we compare the characteristics of these two modes theoretically and experimentally as a reference for future mode selection. Finally, to extend the application of ICs and encourage AI-driven blockchain intelligence, we propose a technical route that helps blockchain autonomously respond to AI tasks through the dynamic and optimal configuration of ICs. Using typical AI tasks of classifying IRIS, MNIST, and ImageNet data sets as examples, we implement and thoroughly evaluate two modes of ICs on Ethereum. Based on the constructed ICs, we illustrate their optimal configuration and automatic response process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework.}

In this paper, we harmonize functional encryption and blockchain to propose a reliable and privacy-aware access control system named R-PAC.

With a combination of all-or-nothing encapsulation technology, R-PAC supports users’ dynamic joining and key leakage resistance.

We implement a R-PAC prototype and deploy it to a simulated Ethereum network to evaluate its performance. Experiments from both data access and transaction overhead show that R-PAC is with reasonable cost and has a trade-off between efficiency and strong security/functionality.}

An implementation framework is developed using blockchain technologies to record and trace critical attributes during the various life cycle phases of a 3D printing value chain, viz. raw material extraction, chemical processing, polymerization, filament production, 3D printing, and end-of-life recycling of the product. The information on critical attributes of carbon footprint, workers' age, and material flow during the entire value chain is captured to provide authentic output of carbon footprint and labour age during any of the value chain activity. The uniqueness of the current work lies in offering a series of immutable transactions using blockchain technology to comprehend the circularity of 3D printing material and account for the overall carbon footprint produced by a 3D printed product considering its whole value chain. This would improve the traceability and visibility of the material supply chain for 3D printing. On the hindsight, the proposed framework is expected to assist the manufacturing firms to act as responsible manufacturers by providing the authentic data for the computation of environmental assessment as well as social issues of child labour throughout the value chain.}

CTDE empowers sharing knowledge from agents in different environments for updating a shared model. A wide range of applications is supported through CTDE in MARL, such as self-driving vehicle coordination, traffic lights synchronization, or cooperation in various aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT), including resource management. Despite the drawbacks of relying on a central authority for handling model updates, incorporating multiple sources of data raises concerns about the trustworthiness of the process. For instance, participating agents could provide data in the favor of their experiences to shift the model towards certain behaviors. Similarly, sending falsified data for updates could lead to adversarial attacks. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to integrate the Ethereum Blockchain technology to handle model updates in the CTDE paradigm by achieving decentralized storage and consensus mechanism for model updates. In the literature, there exist multiple efforts that propose using reinforcement learning (RL) on Blockchain; however, none of them have considered updating MARL of CTDE on-chain, allowing transparent and auditable record of the training process. Therefore, we propose LearnChain, a framework that offers an integration between the CTDE mechanism and a Consortium Blockchain built between authorized participants, thus avoiding gas costs. At the core of LearnChain, RL is integrated with Quorum, offering separate smart contracts for deployment, data handling with incentive mechanisms, training, target update, and inference. Based on a real use-case entailing management of Vehicular Edge Computing tasks through multi-agent synchronization, we implement LearnChain and evaluate its performance and cost in different settings. Our results show the ability to improve learning from shared experiences and to adapt to environment changes on the Quorum BlockChain.}

abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the network of medical devices, software applications, and healthcare information systems used for remote monitoring and delivery of healthcare services. Despite the several advantages of IoMT for today smart healthcare, security issues are growing due to the inadequate computation, limited storage and insufficient self-protection capabilities of IoMT devices. Authentication of IoMT devices is the main requirement to secure IoMT systems. Although, the recent authentication schemes based on tamper-proof decentralized architecture of blockchain technology are robust and enjoy a high level of security, yet they require high computation, more storage, and long authentication time. These issues lead to reduced scalability and time efficiency, which are necessary for large-scale, time-sensitive IoMT systems. To this end, this paper proposes a novel group authentication framework for IoMT Systems. The group authentication scheme is implemented through a four-phase process, including setup, registration, secret construction, and authentication. To enhance both efficiency and scalability, the proposed group authentication framework employs a combination of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) algorithm, and blockchain-based fog computing technologies. We simulated the proposed framework through the Ethereum platform and Solidity language and its performance is evaluated using the Hyperledger Caliper tool. The simulation experiments of the proposed framework showed that the average latency of authenticating IoMT devices was 0.5 second and the throughput was 400 transactions per second. Our analysis of the proposed framework’s performance against other cutting-edge blockchain-based authentication techniques showed that it outperformed them in terms of latency and throughput. A security analysis of the proposed framework was conducted using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The formal and informal security analysis demonstrated that the proposed framework is secure and resistant to potential authentication-related attacks. We also noted that the average latency of the proposed framework maintains a fairly narrow range when the number of submitted transactions rises, indicating that it supports the scalability of the IoMT system.}

abstract = {After the success of the Bitcoin blockchain, came several cryptocurrencies and blockchain solutions in the last decade. Nonetheless, Blockchain-based systems still suffer from low transaction rates and high transaction processing latencies, which hinder blockchains’ scalability. An entire class of solutions, called Layer-1 scalability solutions, have attempted to incrementally improve such limitations by adding/modifying fundamental blockchain attributes. Recently, a completely different class of works, called Layer-2 protocols, have emerged to tackle the blockchain scalability issues using unconventional approaches. Layer-2 protocols improve transaction processing rates, periods, and fees by minimizing the use of underlying slow and costly blockchains. In fact, the main chain acts just as an instrument for trust establishment and dispute resolution among Layer-2 participants, where only a few transactions are dispatched to the main chain. Thus, Layer-2 blockchain protocols have the potential to transform the domain. However, rapid and discrete developments have resulted in diverse branches of Layer-2 protocols. In this work, we systematically create a broad taxonomy of such protocols and implementations. We discuss each Layer-2 protocol class in detail and also elucidate their respective approaches, salient features, requirements, etc. Moreover, we outline the issues related to these protocols along with a comparative discussion. Our thorough study will help further systematize the knowledge dispersed in the domain and help the readers to better understand the field of Layer-2 protocols.}

This exploratory research investigates why people create, trade or collect NFTs, what value they derive from them, and how online communities contribute to value co-creation. Over the course of two rounds, we interview 38 participants, most of whom are digital natives. We find that engaging with NFTs is the new form of day trading, reflecting financialization of everyday life. The value of NFTs is mainly speculative and utilitarian, and NFTs themselves are best thought of as derivatives. Value co-creation in NFT project communities is largely focused on gaining superior information about the project. We contribute to the crypto-marketing and web3 literature by advancing a novel model of NFT consumer value that extends Holbrook's (1999) typology and distinguishes both positive and negative aspects of consumer value that have been overlooked in mainstream literature. We shed light on the role of communities in an unusual setting: a nascent, illiquid, speculative, informationally opaque market for digital assets. Our study helps creators and brand managers to develop effective NFT strategies.}

But this method is prone to errors and abuse. Many nations utilize digital voting methods to solve the difficulties of paper balloting. A single flaw in digital voting may lead to massive vote-rigging. Election voting methods must be legal, accurate, safe, and convenient. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict acceptance. Due to its end-to-end verification capabilities, blockchain technology was developed to address these problems. To guarantee We have used blockchain technology anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting. By using blockchain our proposed system ensures security, privacy, and integrity. This system provides voter anonymity by keeping the voter information as a hash in the blockchain. It also provides fairness by keeping the casted vote encrypted till the ending time of the election. After ending time, the voter can verify their casted vote, ensuring verifiability. To test our protocol, we put it on Ethereum 2.0, a blockchain platform that uses Solidity as a programming language to create smart contracts. The adoption of smart contracts provides a safe means for performing voter verification, ensuring the correctness of voting results, making the counting system public, and protecting against fraudulent activities. We analyzed the system’s performance based on security and gas costs. It improves in terms of security characteristics and the related cost for the necessary infrastructure.}

IoV integrates vehicles with the internet using a computing paradigm and enables vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, the increase in density and the highly dynamic nature of vehicles have led to exponential complexity in traffic management, data exchange, and route scheduling. Moreover, rapid advancements in vehicular technologies to manage, store, and exchange data have led to serious security concerns. Software-defined networking (SDN), as an emerging networking architecture, has been adopted to control and manage the dynamic nature of vehicles and provide diverse quality of service and security (QoSS). These services include better transportation, resource sharing, network verification, and secure programmability of SDN-based applications. It consists of a centralized controller which uses OpenFlow (OF) protocol and achieves a global view of all the devices in a domain area. However, the network is vulnerable to single point of failure (SPoF), network topology poisoning, denial of service attacks, etc. To counter these attacks, a distributed control plane architecture has been adopted. However, it brings many challenges, and one of the biggest challenges is achieving consensus on information exchange among the controllers controlling different domain areas. Therefore, adopting blockchain technology in SDN-based vehicular network (SDVN) is a viable solution to address the mentioned challenges. The inherent features of blockchain such as decentralization, trust-free, immutability, public auditing and consensus algorithms offer various security services to vehicular networks. Therefore, this survey focuses on different SDN control plane architectures, security services, and challenges in SDVNs. The state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes focusing on security requirements in vehicular networks have been discussed. A summary of blockchain-based SDVNs have been presented. An analysis of SDN controllers, simulation tools, and blockchain platforms for Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) is made.

In this paper we show how it is possible to apply this increasingly popular concept to a traditionally centralized and opaque digital process: Access Control systems. To this aim we expand the XACML standard for Attribute Based Access Control systems with the novel concept of private attributes, i.e. attributes whose values should not be disclosed while still contributing to a policy evaluation result after user consent. Basing our proposal on blockchain systems, we show how to leverage smart contracts and zero knowledge proofs to allow for transparent policies evaluation without disclosing the value of such sensible attributes. Beside formalizing our goals, presenting the system architecture, and discussing its advantages and drawbacks with respect to the traditional model, we provide a reference example to show our proposal innovative capabilities and provide a prototype experimental evaluation to prove its feasibility.}

However, large-scale vaccine production has led to two forms of waste; namely, overproduction and underutilization. Most of today’s systems and technologies used to manage waste data related to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of providing transparency, traceability, accountability, trust, and security features. In this paper, we address the problem of COVID-19 vaccines waste due to their overproduction and underutilization. We propose a blockchain-based solution that is composed of five phases: registration, commitment; production and delivery; consumption; and waste assessment. These phases make up the complete life cycle of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are governed by several smart contracts to ensure accountability of all the actions taken by the involved entities and reduce any excessive waste caused by overproduction, overordering, or underconsumption. We ensure security, traceability, and data provenance by recording all actions through smart contracts in the form of events on an immutable ledger. We utilize decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the costs posed by large-sized file storage when stored on-chain. We present algorithms that describe the logic behind our developed smart contracts. We test and validate the functionalities of our proposed solution. We conduct security, cost, and scalability analyses to show that our solution is affordable, scalable, and secure. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain-based solutions to show its novelty and superiority. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.}

However, privacy disclosure risks concerning service provision and users’ accessing behavior also increase. Traditional privacy protection approaches involve a centralized system with a third-party administrative server, which has the risk of single-point failures and overlooks the issue of privacy information leakage concerning users’ behaviors. Blockchain is a decentralized and traceable technology that provides a reliable solution for secure access by users. This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based secure access framework (BSAF) for cloud-device service collaborations with privacy protection. Specifically, a key matrix encryption mechanism is used to protect the privacy of users’ behaviors, and a fully homomorphic encryption mechanism is designed to protect the privacy of service content. Two smart contracts are designed: a request verification smart contract to verify the access rights of users, and a behavior punishment smart contract to audit users’ access behaviors. Comprehensive experiments on the Ethereum blockchain network show that the proposed BSAF framework outperforms existing schemes in latency reduction and cost saving, and is more suitable for low-profile IoT devices.}
