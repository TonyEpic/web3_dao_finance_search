  abstract={The implementation of blockchain-based token transfers has emerged as a transformative tool for innovation and enhanced financial inclusion. To implement Blockchain based token transfers, smart contracts play a pivotal role in automating complex processes, enhancing efficiency, and driving innovation for tokenized assets and decentralized applications (dApps) that can be run on Ethereum. With rising popularity of smart contracts in 2015, necessity for a standardized token approach within the Ethereum ecosystem is recognized. To address interoperability issues and challenges in exchanging tokens between different applications, the Ethereum Request for Commet-20 (ERC20) standard was introduced through the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC) process. Since then, several numerous schemes have been proposed efforts to enhance token transfers and implementations while adhering to ERC-20 standards. Despite the substantial progress made in optimizing the functionality and efficiency of token transfers, achieving a truly user-friendly experience has remained an ongoing challenge. To address this challenge, several schemes have been proposed to refine the user interface and experience associated with ERC-20 token transfers. Our research work proposes a practical approach to address concerns by creating a simple user-friendly decentralized web application (Web3) using smart contracts that adhere to ERC-20 standards. By focusing on the development of a seamless user experience, the system developed aims to empower users to send tokens effortlessly by connecting to various wallets available in the market.},

  abstract={Centralized marketplaces run on a process where a single authority has control over all activity. They suffer from limitation such as- mandatory fees to be paid to the platform for listing and selling items, lack of privacy and control over account, improper transaction security and so on. This paper presents a decentralized application aiming to reduce these drawbacks using Ethereum blockchain. It was implemented using truffle evolvement framework with solidity language. Ethereum smart contracts contain all functions of this application. Client-side application was created through an API called web3.js. Analytical analyses of this application using Kovan test network show least transactional fees reported in literature till date. The application was shown to have average transaction fee of 0.1524472 (eth) with average run time of 3.5 seconds and average gas consumption of 4.6 gwei, these are the best results obtained till date for such system ensuring cost effectiveness and reducing time complexity. The contract making time was less than a second. Comparison with well-known centralized online marketplaces revealed that proposed system was more economical than current centralized online applications in terms of profit margin.},

  abstract={The emerging Web3 economy and the Blockchain's massive adoption in 2021 shape the industry's future driven by distributed ledgers and smart contracts. Blockchain technology enables traceability, fraud prevention, and faster settlement of business processes, including talent recruitment. The current recruitment requires Applicant Tracking System (ATS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and third-party HR recruitment agencies for sorting and verifying job application documents in every recruitment cycle, which are ineffective and inefficient. This paper proposes a model to discover and recruit reputable talent by leveraging blockchain technology, which enables trustless networks and allows entities to conduct transactions without mutual trust, called the recruitment system. This paper also seeks to enhance the relationship among recruitment entities by adopting a transparent and incorruptible decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) model powered by blockchain technology.},

  abstract={With the growing spiritual needs of people, new generations of digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things, computational power network, artificial intelligence, human-computer interactions, blockchain, digital twins, are continuously evolving and innovating. These technologies are changing people's way of life and production, as well as the economic and social forms that support it. The merging and innovation of digital technology and human society, and humans are moving from the information-physical system CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) to the human-machine-integrated society-level information-physical system CPHS (Cyber-Physical & Human Systems) towards the metaverse. Meanwhile, the continuous iteration and innovation of Internet is also moving from traditional Internet platform models to Web3.0 with digital production, digital consumption, and new virtual spaces in three dimensions as the main economic and social forms based on blockchain technology. In the metaverse and Web3.0, artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) plays a powerful and productive tool role, AIGC being not only a production tool for the metaverse and Web3.0, but also a new paradigm for artificial intelligence development. This paper analyzes the origin of the metaverse, the motivations behind the development of Web3.0, and the new model of AIGC, detailed discussions of the technical systems and mutual relations of metaverse and Web3.0, and finally discusses the development and challenges of metaverse and Web3.0 and AIGC.},

  abstract={The decentralized internet, often termed as Web3, is envisioned as the future of the online world. It holds the promise of addressing the centralization and censorship issues prevalent in today’s web landscape. Yet, a significant hurdle faced by Web3 is its reliance on centralized servers provided by major entities like AWS and Azure. The vulnerability of this reliance becomes apparent when these servers encounter downtime or other disruptions, potentially causing widespread issues. This paper focuses on the crucial necessity of decentralizing Web3’s infrastructure to bolster its resilience against such outages. To accomplish this objective, we introduce an innovative RPC (Remote Procedure Call) relay protocol tailored specifically for Web3. This protocol not only caters to the requirements of Network as a Service (NaaS) platforms but also introduces incentives to motivate network nodes to function as relays. Our research and development efforts focus on two fundamental aspects: first, the technical implementation of the RPC relay protocol, and second, the incentivization mechanisms that reward network nodes for participating as relays. By enabling a more decentralized and robust infrastructure, we aim to enhance the reliability and stability of Web3 services.},

  abstract={Lack of trustworthiness, access policy flexibility, and user privacy preservation in centralized access control systems raise numerous security issues and reduce the collaboration maturity of global data sharing systems. In this paper, we propose a Self-Sovereign Identity-based, Decentralized, and Dynamic (SSIDD) access control system. SSIDD utilizes blockchain technologies to build trust for untrusted data sharing networks and ensures user privacy. Our access control provides high access policy flexibility and security for global inter-enterprise collaborations from a diverse industrial environment. SSIDD authenticates its users based on their Decentralized Identifiers (DID), which are under control of users and can be resolved into a DID document stored on the blockchain. Our data management technology keeps the data sharing systems safe against issues such as data breaches, identity thefts, and privacy violations. Besides, the authorization process of SSIDD is dynamic by adopting several smart contracts. The transparency of rules and agreements in smart contracts and the traceability of records on blockchain ledger provide a high level of security and trust. For proof of concept, we have developed and evaluated a prototype of SSIDD. Our evaluations show that the throughput and latency of our method are within an acceptable range.},

  abstract={E-commerce platforms depend on payment gateways to provide secure online transactions, but the limited acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a payment method remains a challenge. Scalability issues on blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum hinder the execution of micropayments due to high confirmation times and fees. In this paper, we propose a payment system that overcomes these limitations by using a payment gateway that leverages the advantages of the Polygon blockchain network for fast and low-cost transactions. User transaction data is securely managed through the MetaMask digital wallet, allowing for privacy and autonomy. By integrating blockchain technology and digital wallets, the solution seeks to promote broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce. The obtained data highlight the benefits that merchants can obtain as a result.},

  abstract={Chronic disease exists over a period of time and it is very crucial because it can affect the health of disability people more. Normally people think that they are not suffering or affected by the disease because they do not have symptoms. But it does not necessarily mean a person with no symptom has no chronic disease. This paper presents design and prototype implementation of a blockchain system which remotely monitors patient health records. The patient monitoring system is a big challenge and other security threats arises as the health care data transferred from one to another and authorization to create and read transactions, is a major concern related to data loss. The data loss of the patient protected health information which are generated from the devices should be handled carefully. So in this paper we proposed a solidity based smart contract run over a Ethereum virtual machine to facilitate the secure analysis and storing of transactions from and to the sensors. Using the Ethereum protocol, based on a private blockchain and writing the smart contracts to keep track of the patient health information. We have created an automatic system through which the sensors collects the data, then communicates with the decentralized application via the smart contract. The method inside the smart contract collects data when they are called, also reads and writes transactions of all events on the Ethereum virtual network. This solidity based smart contract system along with injected web3, metamask, and truffle environment would support alert transaction to the patient and medical professionals.},

  abstract={Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers a range of financial instruments and services that leverage the capabilities of web3 technology. Maker protocol, which enables users to obtain loans backed by cryptocurrencies, is one of them. Unlike traditional banks, Maker’s data is transparently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. In this research paper, we focus on analyzing the lending aspect of Maker from a traditional finance perspective. To achieve this, we create a unique dataset with loan portfolios from the MakerDAO project, making it the first dataset of its kind in the DeFi field. This publicly available dataset contains essential financial characteristics related to borrowing, including balance, loss given default, annual equivalent rate, and probability of default. Additionally, we develop a specialized mathematical model tailored specifically to this project. This model allows us to estimate the probability of default by considering the presence of crypto-collateral and utilizing Brownian motion passage levels. The results of this study provide valuable insights into lending practices in DeFi projects. They also help bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain-based financial services.},

  abstract={With the explosive development of technology and Internet communication, it has become an inevitable trend to realize the secure storage and sharing of electronic medical data among hospitals. In recent researches, there are also many problems in realizing secure storage and sharing of electronic medical data, such as "data silos", leakage of patient sensitive information due to data sharing and having no reliability about the original data uploaded by patients. To solve the above problems, we propose a blockchain-based medical data storage and secure sharing scheme. In the scheme, we utilize IPFS-based Web3.Storage for medical data storage, propose a sensitivity classification and access control strategy for sensitive data leakage and present a blockchain-based original data reliability checking strategy to check the reliability of the original data. Our scheme is explained in detail in the paper, and the performance analysis of this scheme is carried out to prove the feasibility of this scheme.},

The internet connected, dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the smart home environment creates new security, authentication, and privacy challenges [2]. To solve those challenges, an approach to data privacy in smart home using blockchain technology, which is called smart home based the IoT-Blockchain (SHIB), is proposed in this paper. In order to demonstrate the proposed architecture, an experimental scenario using Ganache, Remix, and web3. js is built among the user, service provider, and smart home to evaluate the performance of the smart contract in the SHIB. Based on the experiment results, the SHIB architecture brings the advantages like data privacy, trust access control, and high extension ability. In addition, the comparison between the proposed architecture and existing models in different parameters such as smart contract, the privacy of data, usage of tokens, updating the policies, and misbehavior judging are performed.},

  abstract={The growing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) has triggered several researches in the industry and academic world. The objective is finding a good trade-off between security, privacy and reliability, without loosing scalability potential. To this end, blockchain technology, previously only applied in the context of cryptocurrencies, has been integrated with IoT applications (BIoT) to fulfill all these needs, bringing a decentralized approach and promoting new business logic ideas to the field. Despite the promising benefits of this integration, BIoT has faced scalability concerns, due to the complex task of handling massive data transactions that can be generated in monitoring IoT applications. In order to contribute with an alternative solution to this problem, this paper proposes a completely decentralized architecture designed for Smart Agriculture. It explores the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS), as a name system that can be updated over time; the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), as a Distributed File System (DFS) to store the IoT data; and a multichain network, built with public and private blockchains, delivering a full Web3 approach that can be applied in IoT data marketplace. Results obtained from evaluating a simulated Smart Vineyard scenario demonstrated that IoChain is capable of effectively managing massive data transmissions and dealing with the appearances of new IoT devices, without increasing transaction fees or transaction processing time.},

  title={Practices of Community Vitalization Using SBT (Soulbound Token) and FT (Fungible Token) on Blockchain}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Among the tokens issued using blockchain, a token that can be identified and unique is called NFT (Non-fungible Token). And an NFT that cannot be transferred is called SBT (Soulbound Token). Since SBT cannot be transferred from an account, it can be used to indicate what the account is. Using SBT in this way reduces the anonymity of blockchain accounts and makes it easier for users to know information about the accounts. Transactions on the blockchain are essentially anonymous. While this brings benefits, it also has drawbacks. In particular, the general public feels uneasy about anonymous transactions, which discourages them from using blockchain. Reducing account anonymity with SBT brings safe and secure transactions to the blockchain. This will remove the anxiety of the general public and lead to mass adoption of blockchain. To verify this hypothesis, we conducted practice with our company's employees as the first effort. First, we prepared a blockchain account for employees who wanted to participate in the practice and issued an SBT to prove that they are employees. And we issued FT (Fungible Token) that is circulated only between accounts that have this SBT. And we have prepared a text chat-based community where only the SBT holders can gather and exchange opinions and information about blockchain. Participants shared their learnings and information about blockchain within this community. FT was actively sent as an acknowledgment for teaching within the community. A post-practice questionnaire suggested that the exchange of FT improved their motivation to learn about blockchain. On the other hand, the participants were more conscious of the UI/UX of sending FT. And they were not aware of the self-sovereignty of blockchain accounts and private keys. It was suggested that excellent UI/UX is important for the mass adoption of Web3 applications. and that only a few users who are interested in technologies may feel the value of self-sovereignty.},

For specific domains, such as drug management and traceability, a system based on Django Python framework, on Ethereum blockchain, and on web3.py library has been developed that can be customized for most real supply chains, automatically generating the specific applications (database schema, smart contracts, apps). A case study about a simple drug traceability system for a producer to hospital wards is described, to show how this approach works.},

  pages={77284-77322},
  abstract={In this paper, we explain the Alphabill family of technologies that addresses both unlimited scalability and unrestricted adaptivity. We deliver a sharded blockchain technology with unlimited scalability, called KSI Cash, which is based on a new form of electronic money scheme, the bill scheme. We present performance tests of KSI Cash that we have conducted with the European Central Bank in order to assess the feasibility of a digital euro. We show the system operating with 100 million wallets and 15,000 transactions per second (under simulation of realistic usage); having an estimated carbon footprint of 0.0001g CO2 per transaction. Furthermore, we show the system operating with up to 2 million payment orders per second, an equivalent of more than 300,000 transactions per second (in a laboratory setting with the central components of KSI Cash), scaling linearly in the number of shards. We explain, in detail, the key concepts that unlock this performance (i.e., the concepts of the bill money scheme). The results provide evidence that the scalability of our technology is unlimited in both permissioned and permissionless scenarios, resulting into the Alphabill Money technology. Next, we contribute the architecture of a universal tokenization platform that allows for universal asset tokenization, transfer and exchange as a global medium of exchange, called Alphabill platform. We reveal the crucial conceptual and technical contributions of the platform’s architecture, including the data structures of KSI Cash and Alphabill Money, the dust collection solution of Alphabill Money, and the atomic swap solution of the Alphabill platform.},

  abstract={Digital identity is becoming one of the core elements during the digitalization age, when more and more processes and interactions are taking place in the digital sphere. Therefore, current identity management approaches will define how these interactions will look in the future, but different fields and communities often approach management with their own solutions and tools, despite their similarities. This includes decentralized digital identities, where the identity is managed with asymmetric cryptographic keys, and no centralized entity oversees the whole identity system. This paper focuses on managing on- and off-chain decentralized digital identities, with the former being used for blockchain networks and the latter for self-sovereignty and privacy. While both types of decentralized identity build on the same cryptographic and identity primitives, there is no single wallet that handles both. Therefore, this paper proposes an orchestration solution for both wallet types, which enables their convergence to a single universal wallet and validates it with a real-life decentralized identity use case.},

Every time a row of blocks is dodged by the turtle, 10 points are added to the score. The current game is over when the Turtle collides with any of the platforms. In order to dodge through the blocks, the Turtle can move left or right using the arrow keys. The speed of the left and right movement of the Turtle varies for each Turtle NFT.

  volume={12},

  pages={36743-36763},
  abstract={Decentralized exchanges are becoming a competitive necessity for Web3 users. However, they cannot beat centralized exchanges in terms of user experience. Due to expensive gas fees, the blockchain cannot implement the classic order book model which is the pillar for traditional finance exchanges. Instead, most decentralized exchanges operate on the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model using a pre-defined mathematical pricing rule. AMM is more efficient to run on the blockchain but the biggest tradeoff is impermanent loss for liquidity providers and price slippage for traders. This remains the most noticeable drawback of today’s AMM. In this paper, we make the following contributions. First, we observe that if AMM is virtualized as an order book, its “order-book” shape is awkwardly different from that of a real-world order book. We argue that this is conceptually connected to the above weakness. We are thus motivated to design an AMM, the first of its kind, that mimics the price impact behaviors of real-world order books. Second, the proposed AMM, thanks to this property, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art AMM in impermanent loss. Interestingly, our AMM can even result in impermanent gain. We are also better for large orders where price slippage is a concern. Third, another feature is that, while today’s AMM typically requires a fixed inventory ratio for the liquidity pool, the new AMM allows this ratio to vary, giving liquidity providers flexible options for joining or exiting the pool. All these advantages are offered without losing desirable properties of an AMM regarding split-order exploitation, arbitrage risks, and liquidity continuity. Our findings are validated by theoretical analysis with mathematical proofs and, also, experimental evaluation which was comprehensively conducted using two real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset representing different market scenarios. Our research is the first in the literature on AMM design that factors in statistical properties from the order book model.},

  abstract={The increased digitalization of society raises concerns regarding data protection and user privacy, and criticism on how the companies handle user data without being transparent and without providing adequate mechanisms for users to control how their own data is being processed or shared. To address this problem and open the way for a secure and efficient society, where the privacy of citizens is paramount, the identity concept and proof of identity mechanisms need to be redesigned from the ground up. In this paper we discuss how the emerging Web3 technologies like distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized storage systems, and crypto wallets can be leveraged to design and implement a decentralized digital identity system based on decentralized identifiers (DID) and self-sovereign identities (SSI). Such a system puts the users in full control over their own data while also providing a solid backbone for building interoperable systems that are secure, scalable, and efficient. We propose different architectures for the decentralized identity infrastructure and storage layer, and also discuss the mapping of these architectures on cloud platforms. The main goal is to provide an architectural blueprint for a scalable, secure, privacy-preserving and trusted system.},

  abstract={Physical documents have many challenges, due to being difficult to exchange and the potential of being lost and sabotaged. Digital documents seem to address some of these challenges, but because of the use of the Internet and reliance on third parties to share and preserve such documents, the privacy and integrity of the digital documents became difficult to maintain. The blockchain technology that Satoshi Nakamoto has proposed for financial transactions can be used to solve the problems of trust in centralized systems and the subversion and alteration thatthese transactions may be exposed to. Blockchain-based systems have shown their effectiveness and ability to solve most security problems related to exchanging systems' transactions. Hence,A decentralized system for exchanging digital documents, using Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), has been proposed to overcome the problems of using trusted third-parties in exchanging digital documents. The proposed system provides immutable and irreversible logs of the process of sending and receiving documents. In this framework, all registered users can encrypt the documents using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm, send, and receive documents using the Ethereum Blockchain's smart contract. The framework was simulated locally using Ganache Blockchain and tested on the official Ethereum test network Ropsten, and the experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The smart contract used in the Ethereum blockchain was written in the Solidity programming language, and the website that was needed to interact with the blockchain was built using React and other different javascript libraries like web3. Additionally, Metamask wallet was used to create the Ethereum accounts which are required to connect and communicate with the Smart Contract that is implemented in the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, the model's results indicated that the model may cost an average of 0.0552$ per transaction, and this shows that the system is affordable. Also, the model has satisfied the three main security requirements which are confidentiality, integrity, and availability by using the suitable countermeasure for each one of them.},

However, there are several potential drawbacks to this, including the spread of false information, data breaches, identity fraud, effective content monitoring, and digital piracy. Using blockchain protocols and Web3 philosophies, it is possible to protect data privacy, data security, and fraudulent identities. By replacing traditional email/name-password authentication with Metamask authentication, user privacy is strengthened. Storing application media on the Ethereum blockchain, a proof-of-concept for application data can be established, thereby preventing data breaches.

  abstract={This article proposes a novel parallel management mode based on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for enterprises by utilizing the artificial systems, computational experiments, parallel execution (ACP) approach, parallel intelligence theory, and blockchain technologies, to realize the distributed management of an enterprise. The artificial enterprise DAO (EnDAO) corresponding to the actual enterprise is constructed, and they constitute a parallel system via virtual–real interaction and parallel execution. Through the non-fungible token (NFT)-based incentive mechanism, metaverse-based virtual learning and training, as well as DAO-based distributed management and decision-making, the management and control of the actual enterprise as well as its employees can be carried out. By virtue of the virtual–real interactions of three types of employees, as well as the virtual–real feedback of three closed loops in the parallel systems, DAO-based parallel management for enterprises can realize descriptive intelligence, predictive intelligence, and prescriptive intelligence. On this basis, this article takes the recruitment-oriented key performance indicator (KPI) management of a startup technology enterprise as the case to introduce the operation processes and illustrate the superiorities of the proposed DAO-based enterprise parallel management mode.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={66-71},
  abstract={In recent years, Blockchain-based Online Social Media (BOSM) platforms have evolved fast due to the advancement of blockchain technology. BOSM can effectively overcome the problems of traditional social media platforms, such as a single point of trust and insufficient incentives for users, by combining a decentralized governance structure and a cryptocurrency-based incentive model, thereby attracting a large number of users and making it a crucial component of Web3. BOSM allows users to downvote low-quality content and aims to decrease the visibility of low-quality content by sorting and filtering it through downvoting. However, this feature may be maliciously exploited by some users to undermine the fairness of the incentive, reduce the quality of highly visible content, and further reduce users’ enthusiasm for content creation and the attractiveness of the platform. In this paper, we study and analyze the downvoting behavior using four years of data collected from Steemit, the largest BOSM platform. We discovered that a significant number of bot accounts were actively downvoting content. In addition, we discovered that roughly 9% of the downvoting activity might be retaliatory. We did not detect any significant instances of downvoting on content for a specific topic. We believe that the findings in this paper will facilitate the future development of user behavior analysis and incentive pattern design in BOSM and Web3.},

  abstract={The movie — The Matrix (1999) — boosted our imagination about how further we can be immersed within the cyber world, i.e., how further the cyber world can be indistinguishable from the real world. Nobody, including the creators, had expected that the aspirational fictional virtual worlds such as “ActiveWorlds (1995)” and “Second Life (2003)” would impact the way of experiencing our real urban environments with many urban experiences embedded into a rich featured 3D environment. Are we going to stay as ourselves while existing in a mirror world? Are the fabricated, created imaginary worlds becoming a part of real worlds or vice versa? The recent once-in-a-lifetime pandemic has confirmed the importance of location and time-independent Digital Twins (DTs) (i.e., virtual scale models) of cities and their automated services which can provide everybody with equity and accessibility. This study analyses how the metaverse (3D elevation of linear Internet), that aims to build high-fidelity virtual worlds with which to interact with, can be engaged within the Smart City (SC) ecosystem with high immersive Quality of Experiences (QoE) leading to increased Quality of Life (QoL). An urban metaverse ecosystem framework — MetaOmniCity — is designed to demonstrate a variety of insights and orchestrational directions for policymakers, city planners and all other stakeholders about how to transform data-driven SCs with DTs into virtually inhabitable cities with a network of shared urban experiences from a metaverse point of view. MetaOmniCity, allowing the metaversification of cities with granular virtual societies, i.e., MetaSocieties, and eliminating the boundaries between the real world and their virtual counterparts can be shaped to the particular requirements and features of cities. Urban metaverse shared worlds, an extension of residents and urban society, where the virtual and the physically real blend and are more organically integrated, would impact urban ways of living significantly with many practical implementations. This would open doors for potential businesses with tremendous global economic value by democratising skills/assets within an urban environment, paving the way for immersive globalisation with the bigger and richer metaverse of Country (MoC) and metaverse of World (MoW) being an immersive DT of the broader universe with tangibly connected cities. MetaOmniCity is expected to accelerate the building, deployment, and adoption of immersive urban metaverse networks for citizens to interface with as an extension of real social and individual experiences.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology is found to have its applicability in almost every domain because of its advantages such as crypto-security, transparency, immutability, decentralized data network. In present times, a smart healthcare system with a blockchain data network and healthcare 4.0 processes provides transparency, easy and faster accessibility, security, efficiency, etc. Healthcare 4.0 trends include industry 4.0 processes such as the internet of things (IoT), industrial IoT (IIoT), cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, etc. The goal of this work is to design a smart healthcare system and it is found to be possible through integration and interoperability of Blockchain 3.0 and Healthcare 4.0 in consideration with healthcare ground-realities. Here, healthcare 4.0 processes used for data accessibility are targeted to be validated through statistical simulation-optimization methods and algorithms. The blockchain is implemented in the Ethereum network, and with associated programming languages, tools, and techniques such as solidity, web3.js, Athena, etc. Further, this work prepares a comparative and comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art blockchain-based smart healthcare systems. The comprehensive survey includes methodology, applications, requirements, outcomes, future directions, etc. A list of groups, organizations, and enterprises are prepared that are working in electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical records (EMR) or electronic personal records (EPR) mainly, and a comparative analysis is drawn concerning adopting the blockchain technology in their processes. This work has explored optimization algorithms applicable to Healthcare 4.0 trends and improves the performance of blockchain-based decentralized applications for the smart healthcare system. Further, smart contracts and their designs are prepared for the proposed system to expedite the trust-building and payment systems. This work has considered simulation and implementation to validate the proposed approach. Simulation results show that the Gas value required (indicating block size and expenditure) lies within current Etherum network Gas limits. The proposed system is active because block utilization lies above 80%. Automated smart contract execution is below 20 seconds. A good number (average 3 per simulation time) is generated in the network that indicates a health competition. Although there is error observed in simulation and implementation that lies between 0.55% and 4.24%, these errors are not affecting overall system performance because simulated and actual (taken in state-of-the-art) data variations are negligible.},

  abstract={Billions of people use social networks, and they playa significant role in people's lifestyles in the current world. At the same time, due to globalization and other factors, the use of these social platforms is expanding daily, and a variety of activities take place inside these platforms. These networks are centralized, allowing social network-owned companies to track and observe the activities of their users. Therefore, this has been challenged to the privacy of the data of users. Also, these companies tend to sell them to third parties keeping huge profits without users' permission. Since data is the most valuable asset in today's and tomorrow's world, many have pointed out this issue. Even though decentralized, community-driven applications have come to playas a solution to this problem, there is still no successful application that competes with centralized social network platforms. Therefore, this study attempted to develop a decentralized social network architecture with the basic functionalities of a social media platform to assure the privacy of the users' data.},

  abstract={Web3, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized network, grants users ownership and enhances the collaboration among devices under monitoring. Benefiting from decentralization and in-memory computing, vehicular edge networks can process tasks such as road object detection distributedly without being attacked. Recently, to provide intelligent service for Web3 users, artificial intelligence applications have been booming, thus generating enormous deep learning models. These models are supposed to be deployed in the edge due to their massive computation. Further-more, edge servers may face overload and intolerable delay for the high concurrency of offloaded deep learning tasks. How to determine an optimal offloading decision in the highly dynamic and heterogeneous edge-cloud environment is still a challenge. To tackle the mentioned challenge, a dynamic offloading strategy based on game theory combined with convolutional neural network (CNN) partition for vehicular edge networks, named GPOV, is proposed. Specifically, CNN partition can utilize resources more efficiently and reduce the delay with parallelism. The game theoretic offloading decision strategy can determine the optimal offloading policy according to the real-time environment. The performance of our strategy is validated in the final part of this article.},

  abstract={In today’s time healthcare is a sensitive subject for anyone living in any part of the world. Medical science works on enhancing the quality and period of life. To provide healthy life at times people might have to undergo surgeries or transplantation as well. The world has improved a lot in technologies and with the advancement; security in the process has been major concern. In times of need for organs or blood, it’s crucial to have a secure and transparent system. People tend to panic in the situation and information about organ or blood donors is not easily accessible when needed. Thus, in this paper a web application is proposed for both organ and blood donors in one place. Or(organ) and B(blood) together is combined to make OraB - a platform for building a community of donors. The aim is to make a decentralized web application that will be a reliable platform for connecting donee with the donors. As it’s a decentralized web app, it will draw out the involvement of a third-party networks completely. Vanilla JS has been used for the front-end, Web3.js has been used for the back-end, and its smart contract is made using javascript similar language solidity. This is a blockchain-based project which assures complete security and transparency in tracking the transaction of organ donation and is quite economical.},

  abstract={The rise of information technology has led to a surge in interest of investors and businesses in advanced futuristic technologies like Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. Blockchain is the heart of web3 technologies. One of the fields that could be revolutionized using it is crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is the process of supporting a project by obtaining modest contributions from a large number of individuals, usually online. Modern day crowdfunding websites are centralized, prone to cyberattacks, charge high amounts of transaction fees, have print rules & regulations and intellectual property risk. Blockchain has emerged as a technology which promises decentralization of a system along with a highly secured database. Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger used to record transactions. Our project proposes a model to switch traditional crowdfunding processes on a Blockchain Network called Polygon. Apps made on Polygon use the same frontend as that used in traditional web2 websites but the backend instead of being a centralized database is an open peer-to-peer network. Our proposed work has a promising future and lots of room for development.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology in education offers immutable records of academic achievements, ensuring secure storage and verification of credentials. It enables transparent, decentralized systems for certification, fostering trust, eliminating fraud, and providing individuals with greater control over their educational data and achievements. Additionally, blockchain facilitates efficient and instant verification of qualifications, streamlining processes for educational institutions, employers, and learners. The current research explores the transformation of non-fungible items into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and their significance in authentication and verification within the blockchain realm. Addressing the limitations of traditional certificates, NFT certificates leverage blockchain technology to ensure trust, ownership proof, and enhanced transferability. The study extensively discusses the ERC721 standard for NFT implementation, the OpenZeppelin library for smart contract security, and tools like Hardhat, Alchemy, Pinata Cloud, and web3.js in NFT creation and deployment. The research demonstrates the practical implementation of NFT token minting, ownership verification, and transfer operations through smart contracts on different networks, highlighting the significance of NFTs in ensuring secure and transparent ownership in the digital landscape.},

  abstract={The quantity and diversity of stakeholders in space is increasing and centralised management of their assets is becoming more complex. New technologies in Web3 such as Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) can bridge the communication gap with neutral and automated systems, and distribute currently centralised processes that are inherently decentralised by nature. One of these processes is Satellite-based Emergency Mapping (SEM) for Disaster Response Management (DRM). With automated decision strategies and transparent ledgers, a fairer and more accessible system can be built to handle the increase in stakeholders as well as the increasing number of natural disasters occurring. A DAO also address' the key issue with the current SEM process, such as decreasing the current three days wait, required to produce the necessary processed and analysed data for end users, after the disaster occurs. Moreover, with fleets of satellites belonging to different governmental and private organisations, a specific central authority cannot be identified to manage the process in an efficient and equitable way. The paper discusses the need for a more decentralised and automated system for DRM by presenting evidence of current bottlenecks and lays the foundations of the first DAO for on-orbit assets management and demonstrates which Web3 technologies could further improve SEM in this first phase of charter activation.},

  abstract={In this paper, a blockchain-based management platform, PackChain, for last-mile delivery is proposed. The growing popularity of online shopping has put immense pressure on the supply-chain industry, especially on last-mile delivery. The available solutions suffer from high cost, and lack of transparency. Therefore, assuring traceability of users' actions has become a critical requirement to establish trust between parties. The proposed PackChain framework uses the Ethereum blockchain to offer a crowdsourcing platform for last-mile delivery with autonomous and transparent processes. PackChain provides all the core functions needed for the delivery framework to operate through smart contracts such as managing user information, accepting offers, verifying transactions, and handling payments. In addition, the framework relies on proofs of delivery as an arbitration mechanism between users to release or hold funds. The proposed framework is implemented using Solidity and Web3.js to interact between clients and carriers. The emulation results demonstrate the feasibility and cost-efficiency of the proposed solution11The full code of the smart contract and the related logic is also made publicly available on Github..},

  abstract={Git has been the de-facto version control system for the Software Development industry. Although Git is distributed, developers’ tools for collaboration, such as GitHub, are centralized entities owned by large corporations such as Microsoft. The centralization creates trust and privacy issues for software development companies (preserving their intellectual property), along with a significant" single point of failure" issue. In addition, such centralized systems are susceptible to Sybil and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks due to the presence of malicious individuals. Blockchain technology has many key characteristics (such as decentralization, transparency, immutability, and audibility), solving these centralization issues. However, the requirement of having a storage system to store the user’s repositories over the blockchain creates a scalability issue (in terms of storage). Most importantly, it makes data (code) privacy more severe due to its open nature. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized alternative solution and framework named "DCGit" powered by Web3 technologies such as the Ethereum Blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to provide security and scalability yet user-friendly collaboration for software development.},

  abstract={Blockchain Technology has grabbed a lot of attention in the past few decades as an emerging technology majorly for crypto-exchanges. However, in 2-3 years, blockchain technology has gone through a path of diffusion across domains which are way on the far side, from its initial fintech applications. Media, Telecommunication, life sciences, defense, healthcare, government, etc., are industries where rapid adoption of this technology is seen. The education sector can also benefit from this technology's pertinent features, such as immutability, distributed ledger, and transparency. Record management, course evaluation, assistive learning environment, transcripts protection, and verification are the potential areas where institutional organizations can utilize blockchain. VerifyB is a blockchain-based system that promotes interoperability between institutions/ organizations to manage and assure students' records without any third-party entity intervention. The system is deployed on Ethereum Blockchain. It defines how blockchain technology can be adopted and leveraged to store students' educational records using IPFS (Interplanetary File System). It proposes how students can share their transcripts with institutions and employers using QR codes. Also, institutions can sign those records with access control using web3, and the authenticated employers can verify those transcripts and the signatures on the same platform. This system will help students as well as institutions to maintain security and transparency at the same time. Based on the analysis, VerifyB is a reliable, completely decentralized, secure, and tamper-proof system that implements storage, maintenance, and verification of educational records.},

  abstract={The world of web3 is currently being plagued by security risks. In the first half of 2022 alone, web3 projects have lost more than $2 billion due to various security issues, out of which more than 76% of the projects have been audited. At present, the main attack surfaces on the web3 chain, including oracle manipulation, logical loopholes across smart contracts and MEV front-running transactions, cannot be defended through the current mainstream security methods, such as contract auditing, and can only be passively defended after receiving the alerts of malicious attacks. Hence, there is a huge demand for more proactive defense products in the market. However, most of the existing security products and security defense solutions are limited in defense capabilities, as they rely on external mechanisms and thus cannot effectively identify and counter hacker attacks during the contract execution. This paper proposes a new security system for smart contracts on the blockchain and demonstrates how it can actively defend against malicious attacks and provide effective protection for assets on the blockchain through experimental verification and comparison. It compares the existing on-chain security verification solutions as well as the engineering development model and performs logic-based argument verification during on-chain transaction execution and high-precision computation-intensive verification in the off-chain sandbox environment, thereby can prevent risky transactions, protect assets, and promote the security and development of the entire web3.},

  abstract={The advent of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous innovations in online governance, with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) emerging as a prominent development, often referred to as “digital jurisdictions.” Despite experiencing remarkable growth, currently boasting nearly 7M users and   ${\$}$  18 billion in assets, DAOs remain relatively underexplored in the existing literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

  abstract={Combining machine learning with IoT offers new and exciting possibilities for service innovation. A core challenge for such systems is model training and pipeline monitoring/management while not revealing sensitive data or introducing new attack points. Innovative solutions that reveal network structure and topology are often in conflict with security/privacy design principles. In this paper, we consider the system communication between sensors, edge, and the cloud that does not reveal the origin source or destination of the data. A core contribution is how to apply Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to decentralized architectures that are not under the direct control of a service provider. The aim is to decouple the Machine Learning (ML) solution, data platform, and sensors while avoiding service level degradation. We utilize an unlinkable end-to-end encrypted asynchronous communication protocol called Whisper that is based on the Ethereum blockchain to achieve sender and receiver anonymity. The Whisper protocol provides a level of darkness that maintains anonymity in communication.},

Consequently, many decentralized finance applications (DeFi apps) have emerged, which aim to reconstruct traditional finance and provide financial services with decentralization, transparency, and autonomy. To better understand the characteristics of DeFi apps in this rapidly evolving era, in this paper, we propose to profile DeFi apps based on 666 rigorously classified DeFi apps from a multi-layer perspective, which includes the transaction layer, token layer, and value layer. Our research provides insight into the multiple layers of DeFi apps, including both the breadth and the depth of current transactions, the degree to which apps are interconnected at the level of value flow, and an initial investigation into the relationship between whale trading and market crashes, which better help DeFi app developers with app design, performance evaluation, and optimization.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology allows players to own in-game assets and to be rewarded with NFTs or tokens for their game achievements, thus can be a game changer for all the gaming industry. One central issue is how to check that conditions for achievements are met (e.g., that the player completed level 10). Current approaches open cheating backdoors (e.g. if the client checks the conditions) or introduce centralization points (if a backend checks the condition). Ideally, we would like to “run” games on chain, but so far that has not been possible due to the high computational cost, especially on Ethereum; however, the development of technologies like proofs of computation can solve this problem. Being able to run games on the blockchain, new decentralized rewarding systems can be built to ensure the fair and transparent rewarding of game achievements.},

  abstract={With the advent of technology in the medical industry, telesurgery has emerged as a transformative era of conventional medical practices to facilitate remote and efficient surgical procedures for the betterment of patients' health. Moreover, innovative technologies introduce a full-immersive metaverse environment for enabling communication between patients and doctors virtually and efficiently. Nevertheless, remote telesurgery operations in the metaverse are susceptible to various security and privacy issues that need to be tackled to secure the patient's confidential health data. Thus, we design an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) for selecting and conducting telesurgery operations based on the doctors' specialization and type of surgery. The proposed application ensures secure and preserved communication between patient and doctor in the metaverse environment by deploying the smart contract in the Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). DApp is designed using web3 and JavaScript (JS) to reflect the telesurgery operations to the doctor and patient in the metaverse environment. Finally, the proposed smart contract for the application is evaluated based on parameters such as gas consumption analysis for smart contract functions and doctors registered and cost analysis for smart contract functions.},

  abstract={Often, in today’s world, it is difficult to make new acquaintances if we discuss in our social group, and even for individuals, finding someone who has common interests can be challenging. Additionally, by utilizing web3, WebRTC, and machine learning, this project facilitates safe connections between individuals with shared interests located all over the world. Every person in this world has unique interests, preferences, and dislikes. Everyone wants to get in touch with someone who shares their interests so that they can communicate more effectively. We support the connection of all types of people in this project because some people need mentoring, others want to practice interviews, others enjoy listening to stories, and still, others want to perform stand-up comedy. People who enjoy learning about new cultures from various nations and languages can also connect.The entire user’s interest data, including age, favourite subject, learned programming languages, consulting interest, interview interest, current employment history, favourite Netflix shows, favourite movies, favourite hero, and favourite song playlist, will be collected for this project. We use all the data from the various individuals to match people using a machine learning algorithm, and then, based on the outcomes, we connect the people using WebRTC so that they can communicate face-to-face while sharing real-time audio and video. More user interest information will increase the precision of finding the ideal match. Our algorithm matches you with various people who can observe, suggest to you, and help you eliminate loneliness by talking to other people while people share their screens and work on tasks like studying and coding.},

  abstract={The blueprint of the proposed Decentralized Smart City of Things (DSCoT) has been presented with smart contracts development and deployment for robust security of resources in the context of cyber-physical systems (CPS) for smart cities. Since non-fungibility provided by the ERC721 standard for the cyber-physical systems (CPSs) components such as the admin, user, and IoT-enabled smart device/s in literature is explicitly missing, the proposed DSCoT devised the functionality of identification and authentication of the assets. The proposed identification and authentication mechanism in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) employs smart contracts to generate an authentication access code based on extended non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are used to authorize access to the corresponding assets. The evaluation and development of the extended NFT protocol for cyber-physical systems have been presented with the public and private blockchain deployments for evaluation comparison. The comparison demonstrated up to 96.69% promising results in terms of execution cost, efficiency, and time complexity compared to other proposed NFT-based solutions.},

  abstract={Due to the impact of the pandemic and globalization, many governments worldwide have begun to replace paper voting with electronic voting systems. This is primarily intended to increase voting efficiency and reduce personnel costs. However, electronic voting is usually centralized, which creates difficulties in ensuring the integrity of the voting process and protecting voter privacy. As a solution, we propose an efficient and anonymous web3-based voting system that provides incentives. The use of blockchain technology ensures that voting results are stored in a decentralized manner, reducing the possibility of tampering and ensuring vote integrity. To protect voter privacy, our system incorporates stealth addresses to conceal ballot content and lightweight ring signatures to verify voter validity without the risk of double voting. Furthermore, our voting system utilizes smart contracts to encourage voting and self-tallying, resulting in improved transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms several existing e-voting systems, thus providing a robust and secure alternative for governments seeking to improve their voting systems.},

The success of NFTs and other blockchain-based innovations depends on their ac-acceptance and use by consumers. This study aims to understand the impact of moral values on the acceptance of NFTs. Based on a quantitative survey with over 800 complete responses, the analysis shows that moral aspects of NFTs are indeed important for potential users. However, there is an attitude-behavior gap, as the positive impact of moral values on the intention to use NFTs is not reflected in the actual current usage of NFTs by the respondents. This study contributes to knowledge by providing new empirical data on the acceptance of NFTs and highlighting the role of moral values on the acceptance decision.},

  abstract={The Web has become an integral part of life, and over the past decade, it has become increasingly centralised, leading to a number of challenges such as censorship and control, particularly in search engines. Recently, the paradigm of the decentralised Web (DWeb), or Web3, has emerged, which aims to provide decentralised alternatives to current systems with decentralised control, transparency, and openness. In this paper we introduce Ditto, a decentralised search mechanism for DWeb content, based on similarity search. Ditto uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to extract similarity signatures and records from content, which are stored on a decentralised index on top of a distributed hash table (DHT). Ditto uniquely supports numerous underlying content networks and types, and supports various use-cases, including keyword-search. Our evaluation shows that our system is feasible and that our search quality, delay, and overhead are comparable to those currently accepted by users of DWeb and search systems.},

  abstract={The adaption of the NFT to the mainstream web3 marketplace has led to the rise of challenges like authenticity and verification. On the other hand, privacy-preserving is one of the important research topics in the data-driven metaverse due to its anonymity while maintaining transparency and security. As the traditional method does not preserve privacy, there is a dire need for a novel privacy-preserving method for NFT authentication while preserving anonymity, transparency, and security. This paper proposes a smart card-based approach for privacy preservation authentication of Non-Fungible Tokens using Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof (NIZKP). The paper presents a Novel NIZKP response with the integration of challenge and proof with the encapsulation of a time-based one-time password (TOTP) solution to address the most critical problem of the proof of the source of the NFT and its rightful owner. The proposed solution is a lightweight mechanism for preventing unauthorized and hostile agents from the accessibility of the system while maintaining privacy and anonymity along with the verification and authenticity of the NFT. We have implemented our approach and compared the communication overhead and functional security features with related work and its precedence over them. The results show that the proposed approach has less communication overhead than the existing work and fulfills all the functional security and privacy-preserving features. It indicates that the proposed method can be an ideal solution for NFT authentication and transaction among users.},

  abstract={Smart city digital twins can provide useful insights by making effective use of multidisciplinary urban data from diverse sources. Whilst these insights provide new information that helps cities in decision making, verifying the authenticity, integrity, traceability and data ownership across various functional units have become critical characteristics to ensure the data is from an authentic and trustworthy source. However, these characteristics are rarely considered in a digital twin ecosystem. In this research we introduce a novel framework, namely, ‘SIGNED: Smart cIty diGital twiN vErifiable Data framework’ that is designed on the basis of data ownership, selective disclosure and verifiability principles. Using Verifiable Credentials, SIGNED ensures digital twin data are verifiably authentic i.e., it covers provenance, transparency, and reliability through verifiable presentation. A proof of concept is designed and evaluated based on a smart water management use case to demonstrate the effectiveness of SIGNED in securing verifiable exchange of digital twin data across multiple functional units. The proof-of-concept demonstrates that SIGNED successfully allows the exchange of data in a trusted and verifiable manner at negligible performance cost, thus enhancing security and alleviating privacy issues when sharing data between various functional units in a smart city.},

  abstract={The Web3 social platform Friend.Tech, launched in August 2023, enables users to tokenize and trade their social influence. While quickly attracted 139 thousand users in one month, Friend.Tech’s economic model and business strategies face significant challenges. After conducting a qualitative analysis of this platform, we collected and analyzed relevant on-chain data, and found that the platform’s economic model generates early substantial returns for key opinion leaders (KOLs) but also restricts community size and stable earning potential, with 99.4% of accounts having fewer than 100 followers. Numerous speculative users were attracted to the platform, but only 22.1% of speculative returns were positive, and the trading frequency rapidly declined, with the average token holding period exceeding four days. The reliance on new users, combined with an inevitable decline in platform activity, indicates a less optimistic outlook for the sustainability of this economic model. The platform demonstrates a prominent level of transitivity and tighter social connections compared to existing social platforms. In conclusion, while Friend.Tech appears economically unsustainable, its social model exhibits unique characteristics and serves as a remarkable exploration for the development of Web3.},

  abstract={With the emergence of Web3.0 and blockchain technology, decentralized social platforms like blockchain on-line social networks (BOSN) have provided enhanced privacy protection while making network regulation more challenging. Influence maximization (IM) has always been a critical technical focus in areas such as viral marketing, network regulation, and opinion monitoring. Currently, a significant amount of existing literature revolves around the optimization of influence maximization problems such as greedy algorithms, heuristic algorithms and classical propagation models. In this paper, we first develop a linear threshold model that is sensitive to the word-of-mouth effect, which appropriately reflects the reputation mechanism of blockchain social networks. Moreover, we have devised an algorithm (CRB) based on community segmentation and community ranking to optimize the operational efficiency of the greedy algorithm. It measures community impact through three attributes: community social score, community density, and community scale. Series experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and algorithm. Our experimental results reveal the impact of the word-of-mouth effects on decentralized social networks and provide evidence for the effectiveness and efficiency of the CRB algorithm.},

  abstract={As one of the key components of Web 3.0, the security of cryptocurrency is essential to its development and application. A Payment Channel Network (PCN) enhances transaction confirmation speed and throughput by executing blockchain transactions off-chain. However, existing PCN protocols have problems like privacy leaks and offline and challenges in meeting privacy and security demands. Due to such problems, we propose in this work High-Capacity Virtual Channel (HCVC) scheme to achieve payment across PCNs. As a lightweight virtual channel protocol based on the unspent transaction output model, HCVC uses a bidirectional locking mechanism to lock the collateral on payment channels to increase the capacity of the virtual channel. Additionally, a bidirectional punishment mechanism is introduced to deter malicious nodes, maintain balance security, and enable secure peer-to-peer transactions across PCNs, as all phases of HCVC can be performed off-chain without confirming transactions on-chain. Experimental analysis shows that the HCVC performs better in n-path PCNs. Compared to Donner, the communication overhead of HCVC in the open and resolve(undesirable) phases can be reduced by 39% and 37%, respectively, effectively reducing the overhead of transactions and enhancing the transaction throughput of the blockchain.},

  abstract={The Ethereum smart contract language Solidity has caused a breakthrough in the field of blockchain technology with the introduction of logic in contract-form via these smart contracts. Since these contracts are immutable, there is a serious requirement to audit and test these contracts multiple times before they are deployed. There are several cases of financial and reputation damage due to unaudited smart contracts as seen in the cases of the Axie Infinity hack or Wormhole bridge hack which resulted in hundreds of millions of dollar losses. For a developer just getting into web3 development, these hacks might intimidate and drive them away from learning due to the fear of incurring such losses themselves or due to not understanding the reason for hacks. This tool allows a developer to simply paste their contract into a textbox and obtain a list of the contract-based vulnerabilities found via parsing and pattern searching. Mitigation techniques are also suggested line by line to aid the developer in securing the contract. The key difference between this tool and existing technologies is that it is compact and very precise in identifying known contract-based vulnerabilities. Providing developers with a quick and simple interface was the rationale behind the motivation. Tools like parsers and regular expression libraries were used to look for keyword detection methodology. The tool is to be used supplementarily and not as the sole identifier of vulnerabilities since there are multiple layers to web3 security and this tool only identifies smart contract-based vulnerabilities, not off-chain ones. Future additions to this tool may include example vulnerable code snippets and also explanations for the reason they are not safe for deployment as well as mitigations which can be used by any user who is interested in learning web3 security and how hacks happen.},

In practice, however, oracles are not accurate, which makes it difficult for distributed applications to operate predictable services in terms of price and performance.To understand oracle performance we define a new gas prediction accuracy metric. We demonstrate that oracles underprice transactions, causing them to miss the delay target, as well as overprice transactions, causing them to meet the delay target, but at a higher than necessary cost. We provide comparative analysis of five gas price oracles showing their relative accuracy, transaction accept rates, price stability, and discuss factors that influence oracle accuracy. We observe that the ETHGasStation oracle produces the most accurate and stable price predictions. For users that prefer to run their own oracle Web3.py provides comparable performance.},

  abstract={The work is devoted to the analysis of technologies and the design of a responsive social network application with elements of decentralization. Despite all the positives that social networks bring, we can’t forget the potential problems associated with their use. Some of the problems can be minimized by using decentralization, which has the effect of limiting third-party control.The centralized part is created using the Vue.js and Laravel frameworks, which provide basic functions. In the context of decentralization, is very important the creation of a smart contract that is stored in the Ethereum blockchain. By using the Web3.js library, it is possible with a smart contract and a MetaMask wallet to carry out the transactions necessary for storing data on the blockchain.To increase efficiency, the IPFS distributed file system is used, which offers storage of larger files or texts and generates their content, while it is possible to access this data. By decentralizing these functions, data immutability is achieved, censorship is excluded, and data security is also provided.},

  abstract={Advertisers and media owners are becoming more dependent on advertising, when the traditional way is losing its effect, they are eagerly looking for alternative ways to reach consumers, and keeping their brand trust, promise, and image at the top, and to generate more profit. Although there are many ways companies and brands alike can seek to make money off of social media, the traditional platforms are becoming obsolete. Gone are the days of having the logo, a photo, and an attractive slogan sufficient for attracting new customers. It can be said that advertising relies heavily on good aesthetics and application of the brand image, however applying that correctly to the target audience effectively can enhance and produce better outcomes, it's about how a business achieves success, scale worldwide, persuade consumers to buy into it, and reach its goals and profits. To create an effective and impactful advertisement in our modern world, companies must turn to technology; For technology is the enabler of a wider selection of tools that help businesses make better data-driven and informative decisions. This can be done by collecting data through third parties, internal or external surveys, and polls to enhance and improve their product delivery and message. With the use of data, algorithms can be then created to understand the consumer's behavior, therefore, enabling a business to better target its user-base based on their interests, search patterns, and online behavior. Moreover, the collected data from the mentioned tools can be then transformed into resourceful decisions to help the business better understand its user-base, therefore choosing from a plethora of options such as using influencers to advertise their product on live-video streams, or the traditional bloggers, and the many content creators available. Web3 is on the horizon, with the accelerative pace the metaverse took over the internet, brands turned to the newly found virtual space to promote themselves. This is a stepping stone into what is to come next as it taps into our day-to-day lives, economy, and social interactions [16]. The main component of web3 is the ability to build on it and interact with the web like never before and securely allowing users to maintain their privacy. Users are able to buy, maintain and sell virtual assets on the blockchain which unleashes a whole new era of using digital goods paved by the improvement of Virtual and Augmented realities known as VR and AR [1]. This has been proven by the famously known “Metaverse” world where companies such as Nintendo, Sony, and other gaming brands as well as celebrities such as Snoop Dogg rushed to create their own virtual theme parks and sold “plot of lands” in the said universe on the blockchain known as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This has created a ripple effect that continued in other virtually made assets, mainly video games, and lastly “The Metaverse” that “Meta” formerly known as “Facebook” is building upon. This research will highlight the United Arab Emirates' advancements in the adoption of the metaverse into its different industries. The United Arab Emirates has taken great measures to integrate the metaverse and its related technology, including cryptocurrencies, into its economy, government sector and ultimately its society. Will Virtual advertisements be developed as a result of Web3.0 and Metaverse's integration of virtual and physical environments and virtual economies?},

  abstract={Modern centralized online marketplaces such as eBay offer an alternative option for consumers to both sell and purchase goods with relative ease. However, drawbacks to these marketplaces include the platform's ability to block merchants at their own whim, the fees paid to the platform when listing a product and when selling a product, and the lack of privacy of users' data. In this paper, we propose an application that remedies all three of these drawbacks through use of the Ethereum blockchain platform. The application was developed using the Truffle development framework. The application's functions were contained within an Ethereum smart contract, which was then migrated to the Ethereum network. The user's input was read through a web interface and sent to the Ethereum network via the web3.js API. Statistics about the application were gathered on the Rinkeby test network. The application was shown to have an average transaction runtime of 3.8 seconds, and an average gas consumption of 4.6 wei. Contract creation times for the application were shown to be less than a second. A cost analysis of the application was then conducted. The gas consumption of the transactions needed to both buy and sell a product was converted into US dollars, and the gas cost of the application was then compared to the cost to use an online auction marketplace such as eBay as well as an in-person auction house such as Sotheby's. The results showed that selling on the application is cheaper than existing online options as well as existing in-person options. These tests showed that our application was successful in addressing the drawbacks of current auction marketplaces.},

  abstract={Various metaverse applications have entered our daily life and show a promising trend that will occupy people's attention in the era of Web3. This makes interoperability across metaverses become one of the fundamental technologies in the context of multiple metaverse platforms. The aim of interoperability is to provide a seamless service for users when their requests interact with multiple metaverses. However, the development of cross-metaverse interoperability is still in its initial stage in both industry and academia. In this article, we review the state- of-the-art cross-metaverse interoperability solutions, which are designed for a dedicated purpose but do not apply to all metaverse platforms. To this end, we propose MetaOpera, a generalized cross-metaverse interoperability protocol. Connecting to MetaOpera by means of wireless communication, users and digital objects across different metaverses that rely on centralized servers or decentralized blockchains are capable of interacting with each other. We also implement a proof-of-concept mechanism for Meta- Opera, aiming at evaluating its performance with a state-of-the-art cross-metaverse solution based on the Sidechains technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the size of cross-metaverse proof and the average latency of cross-metaverse transactions using the proposed solution are about eight to three times smaller, respectively, than those of the Sidechains solution. This article also suggests a number of open issues and challenges faced by cross-metaverse interoperability that may inspire future research.},

  abstract={Income tax is the largest source of tax revenue in India. The tax is used for development of the country which in turn benefits the citizens and improves the lifestyle of the population. Yet, the number of taxpayers in India is about 82.7 million people which is only 6.25 percent of the over 132 crore population. There are various reasons which lead to Indians not paying their taxes, the major being lack of transparency of information about the way the tax is being spent by the government. An application that is completely transparent in information storage is required, which should allow each and every citizen to pay their tax to the government and be able to monitor the usage of their tax money by the government.This research work proposes a novel tax tracker application. This application works completely over the blockchain technology, which prioritises decentralised data as its key principle. This solution can solve the transparency problem by showing the use of the tax amount by the government to the users and will keep a track of the amount and its allocation for various government projects. It also helps the government have a clear vision on how their constituencies are using the allocated budget.},

In order to implement the development goals of multi-energy collaboration, decentralized supply and demand, and intelligent equipment of the energy Internet [3], it is necessary to solve the problem of identity authentication and access authorization of diversified subjects under cross-industry and cross-agency conditions. And for such problems, DID provides a technical framework that balances security, efficiency, and customer experience.

  abstract={While the primary focus of 5G has been on industry verticals, future 6G mobile networks are anticipated to become more human-centered. Emerging cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) aim at functionally integrating human beings into today's cyber-physical systems at the social, cognitive, and physical levels. CPSSs are instrumental in realizing the human-centered Society 5.0 vision. Society 5.0 envisions human beings increasingly interacting with social robots and embodied artificial intelligence in their daily lives. In this article, we build on our recent work on robonomics in the 6G era. Robonomics is an emerging field that investigates social human-robot interaction and its sociotechnical impact as well as blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, not only coins but - more interestingly - also tokens. Specifically, we study the tokenization process of creating tokenized digital twins of assets and access rights in the physical and digital world, paying close attention to its central role in ushering in the future Web3 and its underlying token economy, the successor of today's information and platform economies. After introducing our CPSS-based bottom-up multilayer token engineering framework for Society 5.0, we experimentally demonstrate how the collective human intelligence of a blockchain-enabled decentralized autonomous organization can be enhanced via purpose-driven tokens.},

Possible solutions are explored to create compatible IoT environment when massive data packets have been exposed and shared in complex scenarios. Specifically, we first present common cyberattack approaches inspired by well-known service patterns and typical network characteristics. The information centric requirements are investigated to reduce the leakage risk of existing procedures, which provides necessary repertoire for implementations. The details of RDN design and deployment include target content classifications, representative combination analysis, caching pattern identifications, and so on. Finally, we validate the RDN prototype to illustrate endogenous advantages and potential utilities.},

  pages={653-658},
  abstract={With the emergence of technologies like web3.0, smart contracts have witnessed a flourishing development trend. However, the threat posed by contract vulnerabilities hinders the progress in this field. Traditional vulnerability detection tools have lost their effectiveness due to the unique code and function characteristics of smart contracts. Consequently, a novel approach utilizing deep learning for intelligent contract vulnerability detection has emerged. Nevertheless, the current solutions still face bottlenecks in terms of accuracy and efficiency, primarily due to the scarcity of labeled vulnerability samples. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient intelligent contract vulnerability detection approach called SCVulBERT, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT). The proposed approach leverages transfer learning and utilizes rich prior knowledge for training to ensure the model’s effectiveness in a scarce supervised sample environment. Furthermore, to enhance tokenization efficiency, a specialized tokenizer called SCVulTokenizer is designed to transform contract code into parameters recognizable by neural networks. The proposed approach utilizes the BERT network architecture to extract more precise and efficient features from the context, thereby achieving accurate and efficient vulnerability detection. Experimental comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing solutions in the context of scarce supervised samples, exhibiting significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Specifically, regarding vulnerability detection for reentrancy, timestamp, and delegate call, the F1-scores achieved by the proposed approach show respective improvements of 13.71%, 13.14%, and 7.7% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract={The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), combines developments in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), Web3, blockchain, 3D printing, genetic engineering, quantum computing, and other technologies. It is the driving force for the delivery of variety of goods and services that are quickly turning into necessities for modern living. The 4IR represents a fundamental shift in the way we work and live. By serving as test beds for innovation and educating the next generation, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) highlight their role in influencing technology use. In order for HEI to provide future generations with the appropriate 4IR knowledge and skills, it is crucial to consider how these skills are delivered within these institutions, in terms of teaching and learning. This work evaluates the scientific output of 4IR delivery in HEI from 2020 to 2023 from the Web of Science (WoS) database using a bibliometric perspective. We retrieved 193 documents from the WoS database and analyze them. We also noted that Mexico emerges as the leader in 4IR skills development in HEIs.},

  abstract={Extended Reality (XR) is expected to grow exponentially with significant investments from big tech companies such as Meta and the introduction of related and supporting new technologies such as web3, blockchain, etc. Like other technologies, most of the discussion and analysis is focused on the positive benefits of XR technologies and systems at the inception stage. If history was any guide, then the negative impacts of XR technologies with ultra-personalization capabilities and advanced immersive technologies are likely to be much worse, especially for teenagers. Based on the current direction of regulations and laws related to the use of technologies, including social media and XR, the current expectation is that parents ‘regulate’ the usage of the technologies and nudge their teenage children away from the ill effects of XR technologies [1] . This is an unreasonable expectation and an onerous burden placed on the parents given personalized algorithms and the fast-changing nature of the underlying technologies. ParGuard, a smartphone-based app system, is designed to help parents to navigate through a maze of technologies and ultra-personalization algorithms, and guard children from the ill effects of new technologies.},

  abstract={Digital media is one of the most shared, influenced and highly used forms of the medium in the 21st century. Its presence ranges from simple images, shared in a Peer-to-Peer network to a world-renowned newspaper that provides second to second update on events around the world at the comfort zone. With this ease-of-access and anonymity it is easier than ever to copy and claim someone else’s work as their own. This nefarious practice of copyright infringement has high stakes when monetization is involved, especially in a high-stake venture such as NFT (Non-fungible Token) based artworks that are not only meant to be unique but also should benefit the artists not the people who masquerades as the true owner of the said art. To avoid such malpractices, watermarking is one of the oldest yet most used methods of authentication techniques for images. It is more effective if it’s hidden in plain sight (most of the times within the image’s meta-data,) so that it wouldn’t affect the appearance of the image but provides the impact, nonetheless. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) algorithm based hidden image watermarking is implemented to focus more on domain frequency. Furthermore, Domain Frequency is extracted to transform the original image and to add the watermark. DCT is implemented to enhance the rate of watermark processing. The whole project, in their individual modules discuss Image processing, encoding the said output with the watermark image and decrypting the said resultant to verify the watermark. As said before, the applications are vast with the emerging technology of Web3 and blockchain backed projects.},

  abstract={The computation need of neural networks has out-paced the capabilities of many individual users whose computers, mobile devices, and other devices are relatively limited in computation power. To solve this problem, currently users need to offload the model training task to the cloud that has many computing resources. On the other hand, many devices on the edge have idling CPU cycles not used. Inspired by the successes of crowdsourcing and decentralized computing platforms such as blockchain and Web3, we propose to outsource an individual's neural network training task to edge devices, such that individuals can train their own neural network models without relying on the centralized cloud. Specifically, we design a divide-and-conquer learning framework in the edge computing environment. A user can divide the training computation of its neural network into neuron-sized computation tasks and distribute them to devices in the edge based on their available resources. The results will be returned to the user and aggregated in an iterative process to obtain the final neural network model. To protect the privacy of the user's data and model, shuffling is done to both the data and the neural network model before the computation task is distributed to edge nodes. Security against misbehaving edge nodes can also be provisioned by redundancy in task assignment.},

  abstract={Different from “read” based Web1 and “read-write” based Web2, “read-write-own” based Web3 is proposed as a typical user-centric internet to open the new generation of World Wide Web, which is expected to not allow the power to rest with a few big internet companies. Generally, Web3 is decentralized and semantic depending on user behavior, and thus the zero-trust architecture should be created initially. To hasten its arrival, a comprehensive discussion on its architecture and enabling technologies is inspired. Specifically, to access Web3, it is essential to study how to establish an identity management system. Meanwhile, for resource description and data verification, it is necessary to set up decentralized identifiers (DID), and link the data to identifiers in the form of DID document. In particular, a decentralized network operating system is an indispensable underlying technology for Web3, incorporating concepts such as decentralization and user-driven philosophy. Therefore, the corresponding technologies for the operating system such as blockchain and distributed ledger technology should be further studied and developed. Moreover, in order to reduce the consensus cost, a large-scale incentive mechanism is also the basis of long-term sustainability, which can attract and motivate distributed players to participate in the maintenance of Web3. Last but not the least, Web3 is built on a physical infrastructure relying on communication, networking, storage and computing, which is crucial to establishing an effective and secure Web3. This encourages us to study communication, networking, storage and computing in Web3, as well as the specific requirements of running Web3.},

Decentralization has also received increasing attention in management, decision, governance, and economics, despite its incomparability in AI. Going beyond centralized and distributed AI, this article reviews and delineates the conceptual map, research issues, and technical opportunities of decentralized AI and edge intelligence. The complementarity and metasynthesis between centralized and decentralized AI are also elaborated. We further assess where decentralized AI and edge intelligence can enable and promote smart blockchain, Web3, metaverse and decentralized science disciplinarily, technically, practically, and more broadly.},
