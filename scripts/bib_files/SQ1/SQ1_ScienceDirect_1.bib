abstract = {Platforms and ecosystems provide structures for constellations of economic actors to engage and interact as they seek to create and capture value. We consider how the constructs of platforms and ecosystems relate and explore why they have become more ubiquitous by focusing on the nature of their value-add. We propose that they emerge as a response to distinct market failures, which we identify, and we explain which specific externalities they help overcome. We also identify post-hoc endogenous functional and distributional failures that platforms and ecosystems, in turn, generate. We discuss implications for theory and practice.}

abstract = {Sharing Internet of Things (IoT) data across different sectors, such as in smart cities, becomes complex due to heterogeneity. This poses challenges related to a lack of interoperability, data quality issues and lack of context information, and a lack of data veracity (or accuracy). In addition, there are privacy concerns as IoT data may contain personally identifiable information. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel semantic technology-based framework that enables data sharing in a GDPR-compliant manner while ensuring that the data shared is interoperable, contains required context information, is of acceptable quality, and is accurate and trustworthy. The proposed framework also accounts for the edge/fog, an upcoming computing paradigm for the IoT to support real-time decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with two different edge and fog–edge scenarios using resource-constrained IoT devices, such as the Raspberry Pi. In addition, we also evaluate shared data quality, interoperability and veracity. Our key finding is that the proposed framework can be employed on IoT devices with limited resources due to its low CPU and memory utilization for analytics operations and data transformation and migration operations. The low overhead of the framework supports real-time decision making. In addition, the 100% accuracy of our evaluation of the data quality and veracity based on 180 different observations demonstrates that the proposed framework can guarantee both data quality and veracity.}

abstract = {The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.}

There is a research gap where entrepreneurship is relatively little researched in the context of trust. Mainstream trust research overlooks entrepreneurship and its special features of placing uncertainty at the heart of its operation, in particular in the information, communication and high technology sector, and therefore among startups. The above results from the still weak research invention regarding the issues of managing these enterprises. Meanwhile, this is an area particularly predestined for research on trust. Therefore, the aim of the article is to try to answer the question about importance and the ways of building trust from the point of view of startup owners. Author used critical review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews to carried out the research in startups implementing foreign expansion outside of Poland. The presented study is part of a wider project, including interviews with leaders of other technology companies, as well as with other employees of selected departments of these companies. This article presents the results of the study of the one of group of leaders who are owners of startups, implementing foreign expansion. The conclusions drawn from the analysis confirm that the challenges underlying the foreign expansion of startups are not only technical, financial, legal or related to tax, etc. but they should be rooted and related to the need to take into account the specificity of the organizational culture of companies in their activities. The conducted research showed a high level of leaders' awareness of the need to build collective trust between employees in the company, but there is a need for systemic development at the institutional level regarding methods and tools that can be used in this regard. The key issue here is the growing importance of the organizational culture of trust built and developed by leaders, based on values. Therefore, the problem of managing startups in this context seems important, so that they can dynamically develop and grow.}

This economy straddles both the physical and digital worlds—the items within it are bought and sold via digital currencies that can be exchanged for other digital currencies recognized in the physical world. Decentralized worlds are both places for users to “own” what they have in the environment in a new and more complete way and act as exchanges for the buying and selling of unique digital goods. While the user may “own” a digital object (unlike the environments explored in Chapter 6), there are still codes of conduct and the administrator of the environment retains an ability to terminate access. This termination takes on additional meaning in light of the economic structure.}

abstract = {Information gaps are one of the significant barriers to a flourishing circular economy (CE). Information systems (IS) are implemented to overcome these gaps as part of digitalization efforts. In the CE context, IS can provide insights into the sustainability and circularity of a product and its value chain. In fact, many products come into existence through supply chains encompassing plentiful suppliers and complex in-use and after-use streams. Implementing CE IS, like obligatory product passports, will significantly scale up information technologies (IT) use. Environmental impacts through IT use, and diverse product lifecycles call for an architecture that allows such a degree of complexity while minimizing burdens. This conference paper summarizes our preliminary results on designing an architecture for CE IS. First, we reviewed the literature on product passports. We created an architecture based on the design science methodology, including a meta-model providing an overview of all concepts. We also show how the architecture can facilitate the CE IS implementation by an example case of remanufacturing. Our results advocate rethinking the concept of product-centered systems towards IS that are more based on CE and digital services.}

A deeper comprehension of the metaverse ecosystem is crucial to facilitate long-term planning and the dynamic adaptation of business models in the closely related e-commerce sector. Consequently, the main objective of this paper is to explore how the metaverse impacts e-commerce business models. A two-round Delphi-based scenario study (time horizon 2035) was conducted with 26 participating experts to achieve the objective. Based on the expert responses, twenty projections were clustered into three possible future scenarios: (1) immersive and emotional commerce, (2) altered digital landscape, and (3) game changer. The scenarios indicate that the metaverse development will strongly influence e-commerce business models at the customer interface and core strategy. New business models will emerge, and existing business models will adopt the metaverse as an additional channel. As purely digital products gain increased importance, the digital landscape will be altered to fulfill new customer requests. Although improbable by 2035, the game-changing scenario entails a complete transition to digital products and the replacement of present e-commerce with metaverse commerce.}

The results reveal that crypto-asset influence on companies' risk profile is substantial, highlighting the importance of considering this asset class when evaluating investment decisions. The study makes significant contributions to academic literature, providing new insights into the impact of companies' exposure to crypto-assets, portfolio performance, and the dynamics of this exposure over time. The findings can help corporations and investors make informed decisions about allocating crypto-assets and assess the potential implications of their involvement in the crypto-asset market.}

abstract = {Wayfinding performance is one of the key issues in pre- or post-occupancy evaluation for large-scale public buildings and such evaluation typically revolves around participants’ wayfinding trajectories. Traditional evaluation methods, including laboratory virtual reality (VR) experiments and computer simulations, have their respective advantages in accuracy or cost-efficiency. However, they either suffer from high costs and low efficiency or sacrifice the diversity of behavioral data for higher efficiency and lower costs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method named “sampling as simulation” (SaS) via an online VR wayfinding experiment. This method allows for the rapid collection of behavioral data at a lower cost to generate highly accurate wayfinding trajectory data for evaluation purposes. It utilizes a model-image integrated approach to create realistic online virtual environments and employs a spatiotemporal replay algorithm to generate a crowd of true-trajectory-driven avatars, significantly enhancing the immersion and realism of the online virtual scenes. This method was demonstrated and validated with a wayfinding performance post-occupancy evaluation (POE) project at the International Departure of Satellite Terminal One (S1) in Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG). In this example, a total of 13,712 original trajectories were collected within a 72-h time window, serving as the original dataset for evaluation. Based on this dataset, the study effectively simulated wayfinding behavior in three different scenarios and evaluated wayfinding performance. Compared to existing methods, the SaS method not only improves data collection efficiency and reduces costs but also maintains the diversity of behavior by generating transformed trajectories directly from human data without behavior modeling.}

Two auction price systems and several settlement mechanisms are formulated and compared to assess local trading profit and local market efficiency. We also implement a SC-based mechanism that embeds the auction results and rules to increase trust in the bidding and settlement processes. Our simulations use actual consumption and generation data from 11 houses with smart appliances and self-generation capabilities. We show that auctions, if used consistently, can help the development of a local trade by encouraging people to buy from their neighbors and invest in more generating facilities, knowing that there is a local market on which to rely. Compared to the hybrid - Pay-as-Bid (PaB) in the 1st round plus Uniform Price (UP) in the 2nd round - approach, the pure 2-round UP auction was shown to decrease trading with the retailer by 7.5%. The market indicators are quite similar for the two pricing methods, whereas the proposed settlement mechanism reduces the buyers' payments by 7% and increases sellers' encashments by around 8%.}

Even though many cryptographic schemes provide secure communication between devices, errors happen through wireless link. Wireless communications are prone to errors such as session hijacking, masquerading, impersonation attack, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, non-repudiation attack, tampering and many more. Block chain provides immutable transaction with authorized communication. To address the problem of non-repudiation attack in IoT and log false information, block chain based authentication using Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) digital signature is proposed. This method prevents the existence and active participation of fake nodes. The performance of a public key operation is also measured with the crypto metrics of latency (204.2ms, 1642.7ms) and throughput metric (37.2, 12) connections per sec for RSA key sizes of 1024 and 2048 . The environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH (potential for hydrogen) concentration and rainfall are collected from sensors deployed at agricultural lands through node Micro Controller Unit (MCU) and transferred to Block chain enabled edge device. Furthermore, edge intelligence is performed to predict rice production with Machine Learning (ML) algorithm and the best appropriate model is selected from the regression metric which includes, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2).}

It has gained substantial attention recently due to its immersive, interconnected, and virtual environment for meeting evolving customer and market demands. As technology advances, firms implementing the Metaverse may gain a competitive edge and create new revenue streams. However, the service sectors still face challenges in adopting and successfully implementing Metaverse. Therefore, we attempted to establish a theoretical foundation to understand the challenges of Metaverse adoption in the service sector and to develop an integrated framework to analyse the barriers using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) techniques. To achieve this, we first identify barriers from extensive literature and categorise them into six broad categories based on experts’ opinions. Then, we ranked each category and the barriers constituting them based on their criticality through FAHP. The Security and Privacy category has the highest weight among the six categories of barriers, followed by Governance and Standardisation, Infrastructure, User Behaviour and psychology, Feasibility, and Organisational culture and Stakeholder commitment. Further, we developed the causal-effect relationships among the six categories and analysed those categories through the degree of prominence and relationships. We found that Security and Privacy is one of the most influencing barriers. Then, we analysed our proposed decision-making model under different scenarios through sensitivity analysis. This study offers valuable insights into the relationships among the barriers and how they can impact progress towards achieving specific goals or objectives.}

We propose an intrusion detection system based on machine learning that is capable of detecting abnormal behavior by examining network traffic to find unusual data flows. In this paper, we have presented a strategy for intrusion detection through a careful evaluation and selection of the most effective techniques for the following steps of the machine learning process: (i) data preprocessing by using Z-score normalization that preserves the data distribution for the proposed method and handles outliers; (ii) feature selection by using a regression model that simplifies the model complexity and reduces the execution time; and (iii) model selection and training – Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Categorical Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine – with hyperparameter optimization to control the behavior in the training phase and to prevent overfitting. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments carried out using the well-known standard datasets CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS-2018, and CIC-DDoS-2019, both separately and merged. We achieved a high accuracy above 99.8% within a running time of 46.9 s and 0.24 s detection time for the three combined intrusion detection system datasets, thereby showing that the proposed intrusion detection system outperforms the previous methods introduced in the literature.}

From 2011 to 2022, five key narratives are identified as criminality, culture, politics, price and technology. Price, politics, and culture have become more prominent in coverage while the technology narrative has waned. Coverage that is more political or cultural is associated with subsequently lower returns whereas the criminality narrative is associated with higher returns. Together this suggests that as narratives have become more mainstream, they have created additional demand, despite the negative association with criminal activity.}

We have further confirmed that the S&P500 Index negatively influences cryptocurrency returns, which means that these two asset classes are substitutes. Uncertainty and attention indices are relevant in determining returns and the alternative measurement of volatility. However, they remain insignificant for illiquidity and our initial volatility choice.}

Based on a review of the literature in platform studies, we identify challenges and risks that “platformization” may pose for citizen science. These risks include extractivism and commodification, scaling tensions, and technological solutionism. We then present five components of the “platform ecosystem of CBWM,” which we derived following a review and analysis of methods, tools, and equipment used by CBWM groups listed on two citizen science inventories (SciStarter and CitizenScience.gov). Choices about platform uptake and design have implications not only for the kinds of data that are collected, but for the nature of the participation that they elicit from volunteer participants.}

The philosophical foundation is rooted in the positivism paradigm, the methodology is quantitative, and the approach used is deductive. Data was collected in Pakistan and China through judgmental sampling from 384 respondents. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the collected data. The findings validate the relationship between perceived ease of use and the adoption of metaverse with β-value 0.236, t-value 5.207 and p-value 0.000, the relationship between perceived usefulness and the adoption of metaverse with β-value 0.233, t-value 4.017 and p-value 0.000, and the relationship between trust and adoption of a metaverse with β-value 0.192, t-value 3.589 and p-value 0.000. Results also show that the digital divide moderates the relation between perceived ease of use and adopting the metaverse having β-value 0.078, t-value 1.848 and p-value 0.032. Similarly, the findings also show that the digital divide does not moderate the relationships of perceived usefulness and trust with adopting the metaverse. Moreover, the meta culture also does not moderate the relationships of perceived ease of use, usefulness, and trust with adopting the metaverse. The study contributes to theoretical research on adopting a metaverse in healthcare by examining various factors necessary for its development.

Conversely, some of the traditional crypto assets are influenced by the GPR in the short, medium, and longer runs. Metaverse coins are slightly less prone to GPR than traditional crypto assets. The results can be utilized for risk mitigation and investment diversification.}

Part of the focus is placed on the defense mechanisms introduced to help the system fully recover from attacks. However, the framework devoted to risk/threat assessments has also been highlighted, as there is a substantial need to strengthen the systems architecture to be more proactive. In addition, the ethical and societal impact of CPS is emphasized since it is essential to get a vision of the unintended outcomes of the possible evolution of these systems.}

Against this backdrop, we introduce data intermediaries and critically examine the DGA's related legal regime by testing its underlying assumptions and highlighting its intrinsic weaknesses and limitations as part of the broader EU data law puzzle. As a result, the paper brings to the fore certain contradictions between DGA's means and ends. Indeed, due to various questionable assumptions, the DGA imposes requirements that not all data intermediaries can satisfy and entrenches a specific techno-organisational form for data intermediation services that may turn out to be economically non-viable. Consequently, one must wonder whether the DGA's rules on data intermediaries are necessary and proportionate in light of the freedom to conduct a business. We furthermore uncover inconsistencies and loopholes between the DGA, the GDPR, the draft Data Act, and the Digital Markets Act. Overall, while the DGA's underlying efforts are laudable, its precise postulations may hinder the achievement of its underlying objectives due to two main factors. First its own internal limitations and incoherences, and, second, uncertainties and tensions resulting from its interplay with the broader EU data law framework.}

Agents will learn to strategically negotiate terms of exchanges while considering private preferences, necessities, and the public negotiation context of this market. Design details for the market comprising technological enablers such as Internet of Things, Blockchain, Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications are presented. Moreover, the influence of learning context-dependent strategies on negotiation outcomes and market efficiency is analyzed.

We introduce a novel agreement protocol, called Antipaxos, that instead reaches agreement on a collection of proposals using an efficient leaderless fast path when the environment is synchronous and failure-free, and falls back on a more elaborate slow path to handle other cases. We first specify the main safety property of Antipaxos by formalizing a new agreement problem called k-Interactive Consistency (k-IC). Then, we present a solution to this problem in the Byzantine failure model. We prove safety and liveness, and also present an experimental performance evaluation in the Amazon cloud. Our experiments show that Antipaxos achieves several-fold higher failure-free peak throughput than Mir-BFT. The inherent efficiency of our approach stems from the low message complexity of the fast path: agreement on n batches of conflict-prone proposals is achieved using only Θ(n2) messages in one consensus cycle, or Θ(n) amortized messages per batch.}

Prior studies mainly investigate predictors such as historical trading data, macroeconomic development, and public interests in cryptocurrencies for price trend prediction while ignoring the predictive role of the relations between cryptocurrencies. In fact, the price movement of a cryptocurrency may be affected by those of other cryptocurrencies, thus, incorporating cryptocurrency interrelations can further improve the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model for price trend prediction using long short-term memory (LSTM) and relationwise graph attention network (ReGAT), in which both individual cryptocurrency features and cryptocurrency relations are considered. Specifically, a cryptocurrency network is built by using shared features between cryptocurrencies. Further, LSTM is used to profile sequential patterns of individual cryptocurrency features. To fully extract network features, ReGAT is designed to aggregate information conveyed by different types of relations while automatically differentiating their importance. Finally, the conventional and network features are concatenated to predict the price trend. The effectiveness of LSTM-ReGAT is validated using real-world cryptocurrency market data. The trading simulations for Bitcoin and portfolios reveal that our model obtains the highest profits. Our study provides insightful implications for investment decision support in cryptocurrency market.}

Even at low concentrations, these contaminants pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems. To better understand the effects of CECs on aquatic ecosystems, it is important to measure concentrations of these contaminants present in these systems. Currently, there is an imbalance in CEC monitoring, with more attention to some categories of CECs, and a lack of data about environmental concentrations of other types of CECs. Citizen science is a potential tool for improving CEC monitoring and to establish their environmental concentrations. However, incorporating citizen participation in the monitoring of CECs poses some challenges and questions. In this literature review, we explore the landscape of citizen science and community science projects which monitor different groups of CECs in freshwater and marine ecosystems. We also identify the benefits and drawbacks of using citizen science to monitor CECs to provide recommendations for sampling and analytical methods. Our results highlight an existing disparity in frequency of monitoring different groups of CECs with implementing citizen science. Specifically, volunteer participation in microplastic monitoring programs is higher than volunteer participation in pharmaceutical, pesticide, and personal care product programs. These differences, however, do not necessarily imply that fewer sampling and analytical methods are available. Finally, our proposed roadmap provides guidance on which methods can be used to improve monitoring of all groups of CECs through citizen science.}

This article aims to address these challenges by designing an adaptive protocol specifically for the implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm within wireless environments. We first outline the key stages of this adaptive protocol, focusing on enhancing robustness and efficiency in the state synchronization and routing processes, which are demonstrated through extensive simulations. The proposed adaptive protocol intends to ensure consistent states across nodes in wireless networks, which promote reliable and effective distributed systems for a variety of applications in autonomous wireless networks, including Vehicle-to-everything (V2X), Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing.}

abstract = {Cyber-enabled fraud has transformed, becoming more complex and making it harder for targets and law enforcement to detect its occurrence. This study aims to recontextualize a major manifestation of this transformation, a crime called hybrid investment fraud, colloquially known as pig butchering. Hybrid investment fraud describes a cyber-enabled fraud whereby criminals gain the trust of victims by forming connections and relationships, and then exploit this trust by using a series of confidence building and coercive measures designed to encourage victims to continuously invest in securities or commodities until they become unable or unwilling to continue to make payments or the offenders become unreachable. This study further aims to address the existing knowledge gap by focusing on understudied elements of this fraud, such victim and offender characteristics and the ways hybrid investment fraud is perpetrated. To achieve this, we conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 1,300 news articles and court documents between January 1, 2018, and November 1, 2023, to identify 59 cases of hybrid investment fraud targeting victims in the United States. This article both situates hybrid investment fraud within the broader fraud literature and conducts a comprehensive of analysis of hybrid investment fraud cases to identify the types of hybrid investment fraud committed, their impact, victim and offender demographics, and offenders’ tactics, tools, and methods of operation. The findings from this study can inform criminal justice practices and future research of this fraud.}

Scant research supports that hypothesis at a collection level, yet it remains an open question how to leverage the potential in practice. Owing to their non-fungible nature, liquidity of the asset that leads to a mathematically optimal portfolio does not always exist. This letter introduces a practicable portfolio optimization strategy for NFTs based on machine learning, more specifically robust hierarchical risk parity. When applied to portfolios that contain high valued NFT collections, the latter’s inclusion into the portfolio is shown to improve overall portfolio return.}

However, the Metaverse's potential impact on the government sector has been given limited attention. This discussion paper aims to fill this void by reviewing the state of the art, analyzing possible roles of the Metaverse for governments and providing research directions. We found six facilitators and nine barriers and risks. The Metaverse offers much more than a virtual presence or copy of the physical world; significant transformations are needed in government to reap the benefits. Given the evolution of the Metaverse, government presence also needs to evolve, and different governments make different decisions about their Metaverse presence. We recommend more research into the nature, use, applications, transformations, and implications of the Metaverse on government functioning.}

However, to fully capitalize on DT’s potential, we need robust and scalable frontend solutions. This study proposes an innovative approach to overcome the limitations of traditional monolithic frontend frameworks by leveraging micro-frontend technologies. Our goal is to enable seamless connectivity between DTs and develop tailored presentation layers by decomposing complex systems into modular web-based DTs. Additionally, our framework tackles the challenges posed by multi-vendor elements within DTs and facilitates service and virtual environment orchestration for seamless integration and operation, enabling real-time data exchange between virtual models and physical machinery. Insights from its implementation across various applications, including training, monitoring, and control, shed light on its advantages and limitations. This research aims to revolutionize DT creation and management by introducing a scalable and adaptable framework designed to enable Web 3D for Industry and Manufacturing. By integrating cutting-edge micro-frontend technologies, our approach seeks to enhance maintainability, efficiency, and productivity. However, potential limitations such as code duplication and app payload concerns must be acknowledged. Future research will address these limitations to broaden applicability and improve performance. Overall, our proposed framework offers promising solutions to many challenges in industrial settings, paving the way for more efficient and effective DT deployment and management.}

abstract = {The development of open-source software (OSS) projects usually have been driven through collaborations among contributors and strongly relies on volunteering. Thus, allocating software practitioners (e.g., contributors) to a particular task is non-trivial and draws attention away from the development. Therefore, a number of bug bounty platforms have emerged to address this problem through bounty rewards. Especially, Gitcoin, a new bounty platform, introduces a bounty reward mechanism that allows individual issue owners (backers) to define a reward value using cryptocurrencies rather than using crowdfunding mechanisms. Although a number of studies have investigated the phenomenon on bounty platforms, those rely on different bounty reward systems. Our study thus investigates the association between the Gitcoin bounties and their outcomes (i.e., success and non-success). We empirically study over 4,000 issues with Gitcoin bounties using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. We also conducted a comparative study with the Bountysource platform to gain insights into the usage of both platforms. Our study highlights the importance of factors such as the length of the project, issue description, type of bounty issue, and the bounty value, which are found to be highly correlated with the outcome of bounty issues. These findings can provide useful guidance to practitioners. Editor’s note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.}
