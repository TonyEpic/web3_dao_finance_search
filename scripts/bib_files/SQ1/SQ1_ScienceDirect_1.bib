abstract = {Blockchain technology has a great potential for improving efficiency, security and privacy of Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing systems. However, existing solutions relying on a centralized database are susceptible to traditional security problems such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and a single point of failure similar to traditional database systems. In addition, past solutions exposed users to privacy linking attacks and did not tackle performance and scalability challenges. In this paper, we propose a permissioned Blockchain based healthcare data sharing system that integrates Blockchain technology, decentralized file system and threshold signature to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed system is based on Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus algorithm and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). We implemented the proposed system on an enterprise Ethereum Blockchain known as Hyperledger Besu. We evaluated and compared the performance of the proposed system based on various performance metrics such as transaction latency, throughput and failure rate. Experiments were conducted on a variable network size and number of transactions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than existing Blockchain based systems. Moreover, the decentralized file system provides better security than existing traditional centralized database systems while providing the same level of performance.}

We also identify post-hoc endogenous functional and distributional failures that platforms and ecosystems, in turn, generate. We discuss implications for theory and practice.}

abstract = {Mourning Revolutions in the Virtual Anastasis is a psychoanalytical and philosophical analysis, that places contemporary technologies and emerging practices for digital and virtual mourning into conversation with Freudian, Jungian, and Lacanian concepts. Through a series of speculations, the text wants to scrutinise the motives behind today's simulative technologies and hypothesise about the future interrelation between the individual and the absence of death. Although the argument is presented by clearly assuming a contrasting position to the use of VR high-tech novelties, the aim is still to offer a point of reflection rather than imposing a unilateral perspective. Therefore, the emphasis is placed on the multifaceted instances of virtually resurrecting loved ones and the inevitable revolutions that will be carried within the mourning process, ultimately departing from orthodox psychological views. The impacts of these revolutions are still largely obscure, but some light will be thrown by examining the internal dynamics of the individual mind and society as a whole. It will be argued how technological advancements, habitually embraced as a sign of evolution, contextualised within the main argumentation, hold a significant risk of being just an illusion of progress: a social regressive phenomenon in its enactment of unconscious fixations. Moreover, thought-provoking claims challenging the psychosocial institutions are delivered to unfold the ethical and political dynamics, particularly concerning psychoanalysis. The reader might find the role of the latter devalued in the critique engaged, in truth, the concluding argumentation is almost an ode to the practice by expressing the hope that by abandoning its tight conservative frame, such an essential tool of analysis will maintain its relevance in the 21st century. The conclusion of such an adventurous exploration will propose psychoanalysis as philosophy with a clinic.}

This poses challenges related to a lack of interoperability, data quality issues and lack of context information, and a lack of data veracity (or accuracy). In addition, there are privacy concerns as IoT data may contain personally identifiable information. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel semantic technology-based framework that enables data sharing in a GDPR-compliant manner while ensuring that the data shared is interoperable, contains required context information, is of acceptable quality, and is accurate and trustworthy. The proposed framework also accounts for the edge/fog, an upcoming computing paradigm for the IoT to support real-time decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with two different edge and fog–edge scenarios using resource-constrained IoT devices, such as the Raspberry Pi. In addition, we also evaluate shared data quality, interoperability and veracity. Our key finding is that the proposed framework can be employed on IoT devices with limited resources due to its low CPU and memory utilization for analytics operations and data transformation and migration operations. The low overhead of the framework supports real-time decision making. In addition, the 100% accuracy of our evaluation of the data quality and veracity based on 180 different observations demonstrates that the proposed framework can guarantee both data quality and veracity.}

Many services including Peer-to-Peer energy trading, distribution network management, financial settlements, and energy data management are catered through blockchain-enabled platforms. However, areas such as service quality-based pricing strategies, supply–demand balancing in distribution system to attain enhanced reliability and consumption-oriented rewarding mechanisms need improving in order to achieve the full benefits of the envisaged grid architecture. In response, this study proposes a novel Blockchain-as-a-Service for Energy Trading (BaaSET) platform, which offers reputation-based services, executed through smart contracts for smart grid applications. Reputation-based grid operations are automatically executed through smart contracts deployed onto a blockchain. The reputation is estimated using power quality and reliability indices, obtained through grid measurements. Further, tests have been conducted to evaluate the associated latency and the implementation cost of the proposed blockchainized service architecture. Test results signify the performance to be comparatively better considering the state-of-the-art. The results further suggest alternatives to improve the scalability of the architecture, to cater the increasing number of stakeholders in the SG 2.0 environment.}

abstract = {The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.}

From a brand perspective, NFTs can be seen as representations of the brand components, such as the product, the logo, or the image. I argue that NFTs have immense potential to become standalone brand assets. I illustrate how this can be achieved by relating the brand's NFT strategies to the marketing funnel stages. Brands can turn into an NFT their physical products such as shoes, shirts, or art to attract brand awareness, generate cross-selling opportunities, and spark stronger perceived ownership of certain brand elements. Importantly, NFTs can allow brands to form a highly engaging brand community that can support the brand, blend online and offline product ownership, and potentially create a bond between the brand and consumers. These exciting possibilities generate a rich research agenda I present in this paper.}

The safe and effective collection, transmission, and accessibility of electronic health records (EHRs) using modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) is essential for realizing the goals of eHealth. However, the use of EHRs by healthcare practitioners creates the risk of data breaches and jeopardizes patient confidentiality. Fortunately, smart contracts and blockchain technology offer effective EHR access control techniques that can enable secure client identification, authentication, and authorization, enhancing the security of EHRs.So, this paper brings effective Blockchain-based solutions using Hyperledger fabric for providing privacy to EHRs. An effective deployment architecture and chain code were generated for design and access control. In this case, the utilization of Hyperledger Fabric as the Blockchain technology introduces a new consensus mechanism, enabling efficient scalability and safeguarding anonymity. By employing Hyperledger Fabric for framework development, the system achieves its objectives. Experimental results are carried out for analyzing the system performance and also computational tests.}

There is a research gap where entrepreneurship is relatively little researched in the context of trust. Mainstream trust research overlooks entrepreneurship and its special features of placing uncertainty at the heart of its operation, in particular in the information, communication and high technology sector, and therefore among startups. The above results from the still weak research invention regarding the issues of managing these enterprises. Meanwhile, this is an area particularly predestined for research on trust. Therefore, the aim of the article is to try to answer the question about importance and the ways of building trust from the point of view of startup owners. Author used critical review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews to carried out the research in startups implementing foreign expansion outside of Poland. The presented study is part of a wider project, including interviews with leaders of other technology companies, as well as with other employees of selected departments of these companies. This article presents the results of the study of the one of group of leaders who are owners of startups, implementing foreign expansion. The conclusions drawn from the analysis confirm that the challenges underlying the foreign expansion of startups are not only technical, financial, legal or related to tax, etc. but they should be rooted and related to the need to take into account the specificity of the organizational culture of companies in their activities. The conducted research showed a high level of leaders' awareness of the need to build collective trust between employees in the company, but there is a need for systemic development at the institutional level regarding methods and tools that can be used in this regard. The key issue here is the growing importance of the organizational culture of trust built and developed by leaders, based on values. Therefore, the problem of managing startups in this context seems important, so that they can dynamically develop and grow.}

DLT enables direct peer-to-peer transactions of value across a distributed network by providing an immutable and transparent record of these transactions. Furthermore, there is potential for business process optimization and automation on the transaction level through the use of smart contracts, which are code protocols deployed on supported DLT systems. However, DLT research in the construction industry remains at a theoretical level; there have been few implementation case studies to date. One potential reason for this is a knowledge gap between use-case ideas and the DLT technical system implementation. This paper aims to reduce this gap by (1) reviewing and categorizing proposed DLT use cases in construction literature, (2) providing an overview of DLT and its design options, (3) proposing an integrated framework to match DLT design options with desired characteristics of a use case, and (4) analysing the use cases using the new framework. Together, the use case categories and proposed decision framework can guide future implementers toward more connected and structured thinking between the technological properties of DLT and use cases in construction.}

On the other hand, Oracle provides a means to use an external execution environment for smart contracts, but its functional limitations and additional costs limit the growth of the DApp market to DApp users. To address the gas consumption crisis of DApps, we designed an event-based resource offloading solution that allows DApp developers to run their own compute servers. By adopting our solution, DApp users only pay the constant and minimized amount of gas fee, while the external server pays highly reduced amount of gas fee instead. We describe the solution in detail with a sample DApp model and mathematically demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution compared to an Oracle-based implementation. Furthermore, we conducted empirical experiment of actual DApp using EVM and verified the reduction of the gas consumption.}

The package represents a first attempt to regulate a complex and emerging phenomenon, characterised by significant trade-offs. Unsurprisingly, in this early stage of the law-making process several relevant aspects of the crypto environment remain unaddressed, such as pure DeFI models, DAOs, and NFTs. Such regulatory gap is to a large extent attributable to the difficulty of addressing technologically complex issues through command-and-control top-down legislation. The improvements delivered by the Better Regulation Agenda are not enough to solve this conundrum. In this context, the Communication by the Bank of Italy on Decentralised Technology in Finance and Crypto-assets and its first move, the smart-contract MoU, provide an interesting case study to discuss the potential of ‘participatory regulation.’ This experimental form of regulation tries to get the most out of co-regulation, self-regulation, and command-and-control, combining their characters with the view of reconciling the technology neutrality principle with technology-based regulation. Participatory regulation aims to bridge the public and private sector in order to strike a right balance between flexibility and legal certainty, without stifling innovation.}

abstract = {To master a digital technology such as the metaverse, firms have to build and integrate new capabilities, while leaders have to comprehend the strategic factors ensuring this technology will translate into business success. Through a multiple-case study enriched by interviews with prominent experts in the field, we explore (1) how firms can build and integrate digital and organizational capabilities, and (2) what strategic factors leaders should consider as they develop digital business in the metaverse. Our results reveal that capabilities aimed at managing digital assets and at managing organizational factors are built and integrated through two specific mechanisms: organizational change and innovation ecosystems. Furthermore, we offer a three-stage roadmap and a leadership profile to assist with the metaverse transition. The findings enrich theoretical knowledge on the emerging topic of digital business in the metaverse.}

abstract = {Actual challenges with data in physical infrastructure include: 1) the adversity of its velocity based on access and retrieval, thus integration; 2) its value as its intrinsic quality; 3) its extensive volume with a limited variety in terms of systems; and finally, 4) its veracity, as data can be modified to obtain an economical advantage. Physical infrastructure design based on Agile project management and minimum viable products provides benefits against the traditional waterfall method. Agile supports an early return on investment that promotes circular reinvesting while making the product more adaptable to variable social-economical environments. However, Agile also presents inherent issues due to its iterative approach. Furthermore, project information requires an efficient record of the aims, requirements, and governance not only for the investors, owners, or users but also to keep evidence in future health & safety and other statutory compliance. In order to address these issues, this article presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model for data marketplaces with a hierarchical process; each data V&V stage provides a layer of data abstraction, value-added services, and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In addition, this proposed solution applies Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for a decentralised approach where each user keeps and maintains the data within a ledger. The presented model is validated in real data marketplace applications: 1) live data for the Newcastle Urban Observatory Smart City Project, where data are collected from sensors embedded within the smart city via APIs; 2) static data for University College London (UCL)—Real Estate—PEARL Project, where different project users and stakeholders introduce data into a Project Information Model (PIM).}

The Bisq Trade Protocol systematises the peer-to-peer trading of Bitcoin for other currencies and the Bisq DAO decentralises the governance and finance functions of the entire exchange. However, by following the Bisq Trade Protocol and interacting with the Bisq DAO, participants necessarily publish data to the Bitcoin blockchain and broadcast additional data to the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We examine the privacy cost to participants in sharing this data. Specifically, we use novel address clustering heuristics to construct the one-to-many mappings from participants to addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain and augment the address clusters with data stored within the Bisq peer-to-peer network. We describe address clustering heuristics for both the Bisq Trade Protocol and the Bisq DAO. We show that the heuristics aggregate activity performed by each participant: trading, voting, transfers, etc. We identify instances where participants are operating under multiple aliases, some of which are real-world names. We identify the dominant transactors and their role in a two-sided market. We conclude with suggestions to better protect the privacy of participants in the future.}

abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.}

We propose an intrusion detection system based on machine learning that is capable of detecting abnormal behavior by examining network traffic to find unusual data flows. In this paper, we have presented a strategy for intrusion detection through a careful evaluation and selection of the most effective techniques for the following steps of the machine learning process: (i) data preprocessing by using Z-score normalization that preserves the data distribution for the proposed method and handles outliers; (ii) feature selection by using a regression model that simplifies the model complexity and reduces the execution time; and (iii) model selection and training – Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Categorical Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine – with hyperparameter optimization to control the behavior in the training phase and to prevent overfitting. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated by extensive numerical experiments carried out using the well-known standard datasets CIC-IDS-2017, CSE-CIC-IDS-2018, and CIC-DDoS-2019, both separately and merged. We achieved a high accuracy above 99.8% within a running time of 46.9 s and 0.24 s detection time for the three combined intrusion detection system datasets, thereby showing that the proposed intrusion detection system outperforms the previous methods introduced in the literature.}

Specifically, AI has shown huge potential for automating and modeling the threat detection mechanism of complicated wireless systems. The current data-driven AI systems, however, lack transparency and accountability in their decisions, and assuring the reliability and trustworthiness of the data collected from participating entities is an important obstacle to threat detection and decision-making. To this end, we integrate smart contracts with eXplainable AI (XAI) to design a robust cybersecurity framework for ZTN. The proposed framework uses a blockchain and smart contract-enabled access control and authentication mechanism to ensure trust among the participating entities. Additionally, with the collected data, we designed Digital Twins (DTs) for simulating the attack detection operation in the ZTN environment. Specifically, to provide a platform for analysis and the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), the DTs are equipped with a variety of process-aware attack scenarios. A Self Attention-based Long Short Term Memory (SALSTM) network is used to evaluate the attack detection capabilities of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the explainability of the proposed AI-based IDS is achieved using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) tool. The experimental results using N-BaIoT and a self-generated DTs dataset confirm the superiority of the proposed framework over some baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.}

This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic –the smart contracts– and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.}

abstract = {In recent years, the Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0 came into being. With the development of modern industrial intelligent manufacturing technology, digital twins, Web3 and many other digital entity applications are also proposed. These applications apply architectures such as distributed learning, resource sharing, and arithmetic trading, which make high demands on identity authentication, asset authentication, resource addressing, and service location. Therefore, an efficient, secure, and trustworthy Industrial Internet identity resolution system is needed. However, most of the traditional identity resolution systems follow DNS architecture or tree structure, which has the risk of a single point of failure and DDoS attack. And they cannot guarantee the security and privacy of digital identity, personal assets, and device information. So we consider a decentralized approach for identity management, identity authentication, and asset verification. In this paper, we propose a distributed trusted active identity resolution system based on the inter-planetary file system (IPFS) and non-fungible token (NFT), which can provide distributed identity resolution services. And we have designed the system architecture, identity service process, load balancing strategy and smart contract service. In addition, we use Jmeter to verify the performance of the system, and the results show that the system has good high concurrent performance and robustness.}

However, the benefits of the AmI-IoT-based healthcare applications are not availed entirely due to the adversarial threats. IoT networks are prone to cyber attacks due to vulnerable wireless mediums and the absentia of lightweight and robust security protocols. This paper introduces computationally-inexpensive privacy-assuring authentication protocol for AmI-IoT healthcare applications. The use of blockchain & fog computing in the protocol guarantees unforgeability, non-repudiation, transparency, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. The protocol uses physically unclonable functions (PUF), biometrics, and Ethereum powered smart contracts to prevent replay, impersonation, and cloning attacks. Results prove the resource efficiency of the protocol as the smart contract incurs very minimal gas and transaction fees. The Scyther results validate the robustness of the proposed protocol against cyber-attacks. The protocol applies lightweight cryptography primitives (Hash, PUF) instead of conventional public-key cryptography and scalar multiplications. Consequently, the proposed protocol is better than centralized infrastructure-based authentication approaches.}

Blockchain achieves decentralization of power, trust, and secured of being hacked, which solves major problems or issues with the current systems. Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain platform because of its unlimited block size. Many complex problems with smart contracts can be implemented with Ethereum and the eradication of third party organizations interfering in transactions helps solving the issues of financial crisis and it is easy to implement compared to other blockchain technologies. There are certain limitations/issues in processing large number of transactions due to lack of speed in processing the transactions. Ethereum Blockchain code will be executed by different clients with varying speed and the performance level will be different. The goal of this paper is to understand Ethereum transactions and perform the comparative analysis of Geth and Parity ethereum clients on the private blockchain. In this paper, a private blockchain network is setup where the nodes will share the data among peer nodes or blocks within the network. Using this network setup a democracy voting application is developed which makes use of the blockchain to store and process the data, smart contracts are deployed to execute the transactions. Performance analysis of the two most popular ethereum clients Geth and Parity is carried out considering time, consistency and scalability parameters. Results interpret that the overall transactions are 91% on average faster in parity client as compared to Geth client.}

Coverage that is more political or cultural is associated with subsequently lower returns whereas the criminality narrative is associated with higher returns. Together this suggests that as narratives have become more mainstream, they have created additional demand, despite the negative association with criminal activity.}

The Metaverse is an all-encompassing, interconnected virtual environment where users can freely communicate with one another and digital content. This article examines how various technologies, primarily Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), have contributed to the development of the Metaverse (AR). These innovations have revolutionized the way we interact with digital media by enabling us to have genuine, realistic experiences. In addition, we examine the Metaverse technologies that make it possible to construct a fully realized, functional virtual world. Among these are recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrencies, spatial and peripheral computing, and other fields. Our research investigates the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, as well as how they may influence the future of the Metaverse. Furthermore, the article explores the darker aspects of the Metaverse, particularly the emergence of the "dark verse," which underscores the potential for organized illicit activities within the Internet due to insufficient oversight and governance of the Metaverse.}

Against this backdrop, we introduce data intermediaries and critically examine the DGA's related legal regime by testing its underlying assumptions and highlighting its intrinsic weaknesses and limitations as part of the broader EU data law puzzle. As a result, the paper brings to the fore certain contradictions between DGA's means and ends. Indeed, due to various questionable assumptions, the DGA imposes requirements that not all data intermediaries can satisfy and entrenches a specific techno-organisational form for data intermediation services that may turn out to be economically non-viable. Consequently, one must wonder whether the DGA's rules on data intermediaries are necessary and proportionate in light of the freedom to conduct a business. We furthermore uncover inconsistencies and loopholes between the DGA, the GDPR, the draft Data Act, and the Digital Markets Act. Overall, while the DGA's underlying efforts are laudable, its precise postulations may hinder the achievement of its underlying objectives due to two main factors. First its own internal limitations and incoherences, and, second, uncertainties and tensions resulting from its interplay with the broader EU data law framework.}

We introduce a novel agreement protocol, called Antipaxos, that instead reaches agreement on a collection of proposals using an efficient leaderless fast path when the environment is synchronous and failure-free, and falls back on a more elaborate slow path to handle other cases. We first specify the main safety property of Antipaxos by formalizing a new agreement problem called k-Interactive Consistency (k-IC). Then, we present a solution to this problem in the Byzantine failure model. We prove safety and liveness, and also present an experimental performance evaluation in the Amazon cloud. Our experiments show that Antipaxos achieves several-fold higher failure-free peak throughput than Mir-BFT. The inherent efficiency of our approach stems from the low message complexity of the fast path: agreement on n batches of conflict-prone proposals is achieved using only Θ(n2) messages in one consensus cycle, or Θ(n) amortized messages per batch.}

In this article, we argue that just as there is a need to assess and highlight its many ills, there is also an urgent need to foster and expand discussion on what a healthier version of social media could look like. We examine social media from the perspective of its three constituent parts, namely social networks, communication within these networks and the platforms that enable them. Subsequently, we argue that social media as an idea should be reimagined independently of the limited group of platforms that currently monopolize it. To that end, we discuss alternative models such as federated, blockchain-based and public-service social media platforms, and the measures required to ensure a level playing field for their emergence.}

Even at low concentrations, these contaminants pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems. To better understand the effects of CECs on aquatic ecosystems, it is important to measure concentrations of these contaminants present in these systems. Currently, there is an imbalance in CEC monitoring, with more attention to some categories of CECs, and a lack of data about environmental concentrations of other types of CECs. Citizen science is a potential tool for improving CEC monitoring and to establish their environmental concentrations. However, incorporating citizen participation in the monitoring of CECs poses some challenges and questions. In this literature review, we explore the landscape of citizen science and community science projects which monitor different groups of CECs in freshwater and marine ecosystems. We also identify the benefits and drawbacks of using citizen science to monitor CECs to provide recommendations for sampling and analytical methods. Our results highlight an existing disparity in frequency of monitoring different groups of CECs with implementing citizen science. Specifically, volunteer participation in microplastic monitoring programs is higher than volunteer participation in pharmaceutical, pesticide, and personal care product programs. These differences, however, do not necessarily imply that fewer sampling and analytical methods are available. Finally, our proposed roadmap provides guidance on which methods can be used to improve monitoring of all groups of CECs through citizen science.}

Investigating these services is challenging because of their censorship resistance and decentralization, which renders the existing methodologies for cloud-based storage services and peer-to-peer-based file-sharing services insufficient. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel forensic investigation framework that encompasses identifying, collecting, examining, analyzing potential evidence, and preventing the further distribution of the content. The framework works on each node, peer, gateway, and Internet area of the decentralized storage services, integrating investigation steps on both remote and local sides. The usefulness and applicability of the proposed framework were demonstrated through case studies involving phishing and large-scale file sharing using IPFS with Filecoin.}

We found six facilitators and nine barriers and risks. The Metaverse offers much more than a virtual presence or copy of the physical world; significant transformations are needed in government to reap the benefits. Given the evolution of the Metaverse, government presence also needs to evolve, and different governments make different decisions about their Metaverse presence. We recommend more research into the nature, use, applications, transformations, and implications of the Metaverse on government functioning.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the vast majority of Internet services used to distribute hypermedia content follow a centralized model, which is highly dependent on servers and raises several quality and security concerns. Among other issues, this centralized model creates single points of failure, requires trust on providers to avoid censorship and personal data misuse, and results in a scenario where digital content tends to disappear or be inaccessible over time, for example, when a content creator stops maintaining a site or when the content is moved to another location. To improve this, it is necessary to replicate data and follow more distributed models. Nevertheless, current platforms to distribute content in this way, either do not offer an effective mechanism to maintain the privacy of their users or they offer full-anonymity, which contributes to the dissemination of content that goes beyond the law and moral standards of many users. This paper proposes a novel distributed architecture that enables hypermedia resource distribution ensuring censorship resistance and conditional k-anonymity. In the proposed system, users form groups to share hypermedia content where the anonymity of the publisher is preserved only if the publication follows a set of rules defined by the group. To this end, the proposed system uses threshold discernible ring signatures to enable conditional k-anonymity, the Ethereum blockchain platform to manage groups and user identities, and the InterPlanetary File System to store and share hypermedia resources in a distributed way. This document provides the design for the proposed architecture and protocols, it evaluates system risks and its security properties, and it discusses the proposal in general terms.}

Patent examiners are usually overworked to evaluate inventions referring to a large volume of prior arts in a short period.

Moreover, today's centralized IP administration system is inefficient in processing speed, security, and cost. Inefficiencies of IP administration in each national IP office impede speedy and efficient cooperation for international application and registration. This study proposes an IP decentralized ledger (IP dLedger) based on the blockchain to significantly reduce IP administration costs and improve IP use. IP dLedger connects the on-chain (blockchain) to the off-chain (centralized database) systems using IP codes that combine hash values and timestamps. Similar to the web hypertext method, this connective feature of IP dLedger enables users who click on identification information registered in a blockchain network to access, through a hyperlink, a centralized database of enormous volumes of related IP information. Therefore, IP dLedger can reduce IP administration costs, increase IP usage, and facilitate safe and convenient use of the IP data.}

Starting from your smartphone where a user authenticates himself before he could access the data inside to Entering into the White House, you must authenticate yourself, and based on that you are authorized. In this digital world where every Business, MNC, Government Body, Companies, Users, etc. needs a website to inform the world about their presence on the internet, provide services online and become a “Brand”, the risk of leaking user's sensitive information increases. It could be dangerous to the users of the hacked website because their sensitive information like a credit card, bank account details, etc. could be sold in the black market of the “dark web”. The role of the dark web is described in the paper and how the data is sold there and what becomes of it. The paper helps to understand how a secure website is developed that promises the user to keep the sensitive information safe, increases the bond of trust between a client and server which results in a long-term relationship. The aim behind developing an authentication system is to keep users’ sensitive information safe so that hackers cannot steal and sell the information on the dark web's back market. To perform this, the developer needs to understand how to implement authentication. NodeJS, with the help of its framework expressJS and some other packages, is used to develop the authentication and authorization system of the website by the research. Previous papers on this field covered the authentication topic in general. This paper overcame that by going deeper into the field and being server-side language specific. The common types of authentication methods used in different types of websites are discussed in detail and the best methods are purposed for the developer to be implemented for a more secure website.

This conference paper summarizes our preliminary results on designing an architecture for CE IS. First, we reviewed the literature on product passports. We created an architecture based on the design science methodology, including a meta-model providing an overview of all concepts. We also show how the architecture can facilitate the CE IS implementation by an example case of remanufacturing. Our results advocate rethinking the concept of product-centered systems towards IS that are more based on CE and digital services.}

abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) are becoming increasingly popular in the last years. They collect reviews concerning several types of items (e.g., shops, professionals, services, songs or videos) in order to rank them according to a given criterion, and to suggest the most relevant ones to their users. However, most of the currently used RSs exhibit two main drawbacks: they are based on a centralized control model and they do not provide reward mechanisms to encourage the participation of users. To deal with these challenges, the architectures of current RSs could be enhanced through blockchain technology, thus providing novel solutions to decentralize them. As a matter of fact, the blockchain technology could be successfully adopted in this context because smart contracts would allow the decentralization of system control, while cryptocurrency and tokens could be used to implement the reward mechanism. In the light of the above considerations, this manuscript presents a decentralized rating framework aimed to support the users of RSs based on blockchain technology, providing a token-based reward mechanism that remunerates users submitting their reviews to incentivize their participation. Moreover, the proposed system provides a flexible strategy to rank items, allowing users to choose among different functions to combine reviews to obtain item ranking. The performance and the cost of using the proposed system have been evaluated on the Ropsten Ethereum test network. For instance, our experiments have shown that the median time required to store a batch of 35 ratings is about 47 s, while the average time required to obtain the score of an item having 6000 ratings is less than 2.5 s.}

This phenomenon is defining a new economy staging in so-called metaverses. Here, physical-world BMs are modified, virtual-world BMs are implemented, and combinations of physical-world and virtual-world BMs are performed. As a result, new mechanisms of value creation and value capture at the crossroads of physical and virtual economies arise in the metaverse. This paper aims at understanding which are these value mechanisms and how organizations can develop them. To this aim, the paper analyzes the cases of four cross-industry incumbents (namely, Gucci, Samsung, Hyundai, and Nike), which are pivoting their BMs in the metaverse. A framework indicating how to innovate BMs in the metaverse is provided, by looking at both “phygital” transformations (i.e., transformations aimed at joining physical and digital worlds’ realities) and completely virtual immersions shaping firms’ internal processes and relationships with customers. In this way, the paper supports companies in turning the metaverse into value, while also extends the scant academic knowledge on the metaverse’ impact on innovation of BMs.}

We argue that digital twins of IoT devices, with the right design, can enhance the security, reliability, auditability, and interoperability of IoT systems. The salient features of digital twins have made them key elements for the IoT and Industry 4.0. In this paper, we leverage advances in W3C's Web of Things (WoT) standards and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) to present a novel design of the smart contract-based digital twins with enhanced security, transparency, interoperability, and reliability. We provide two different variations of that general design using two different blockchains (one public and one private, permissioned blockchain), and we present design trade-offs. Furthermore, we introduce an architecture for accessing and controlling IoT devices securely and reliably, providing full auditability, while at the same time using the proposed digital twins as an indirection mechanism (proxy). The proposed architecture leverages the blockchain to offer notable properties, namely,decentralization, immutability, auditability, non-repudiation, availability, and reliability. Moreover, it introduces mass actuation, easier management of IoT devices, and enhanced security to the IoT gateways, enables new business models, and makes consumer devices (vendor-)agnostic.}

abstract = {Given the ongoing transition towards a more decentralised and adaptive energy system, the potential of blockchain-enabled smart contracts for the energy sector is being increasingly recognised. Due to their self-executing, customisable and tamper-proof nature, they are seen as a key technology for enabling the transition to a more efficient, transparent and transactive energy market. The applications of smart contracts include coordination of smart electric vehicle charging, automated demand-side response, peer-to-peer energy trading and allocation of the control duties amongst the network operators. Nevertheless, their use in the energy sector is still in its early stages as there are many open challenges related to security, privacy, scalability and billing. In this paper, we systematically review 178 peer-reviewed publications and 13 innovation projects, providing a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of smart contracts used in the energy sector. This work offers a broad perspective on the opportunities and challenges that stakeholders using this technology face, in both current and emergent markets, such as peer-to-peer energy trading platforms. To provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in the technology, we propose a systematic model of the smart contracting process, by developing a novel 6-layer architecture, as well as presenting a sample energy contract in pseudocode form and as open-source code. Our analysis focuses on the two mainstream application areas we identify for smart contract use in this area: energy and flexibility trading, and distributed control. The paper concludes with a comprehensive, critical discussion of the advantages and challenges that must be addressed in the area of smart contracts and blockchains in energy, and a set of recommendations that researchers and developers should consider when applying smart contracts to energy system settings.}

abstract = {Initial coin offering (ICO) is a Web-3 based financing method for ventures, which allows them to use digital assets (e.g., tokens) to raise capital. During an ICO, the entrepreneur has control on ownership; they can choose to issue a very small number of tokens which would allow them to keep “their skin in the game” and retain ownership, or issue all the tokens they hold, which would distribute ownership to investors and have a community-decentralized orientation. While previous literature has identified several factors of ICO success, they have not delved into the role of ownership in ICO success. In this study, we explore whether retaining or distributing ownership during an ICO is more beneficial for raising capital. We find a two-pronged explanation. When looking at ICOs maintaining a higher level of ownership, entrepreneurs are catering to corporate-market logic investors, and we see a U relationship where the optimal percentage in which the entrepreneurs show they have skin in the game at the same time as giving enough to investors. But then, there are ICOs distributing most of its ownership in which entrepreneurs are attracting community-oriented investors, and as such, the higher the distribution the higher the investment. We propose that this is related to how there are different investors audiences’ that will value different practices and ideals and choose differently on what types of projects to invest in. Our research elucidates this new funding source. Nonetheless, future research should investigate these exploratory findings.}

The superior accuracy and completeness of the digital evidence can be achieved without human interfering. The experimental results show that the on-scene examiner can manage the preservation and collection of digital evidence by typing two key values, CaseID and EvidenceID.

To investigate the status of existing ETS interventions on ground transportation emissions, a comprehensive literature review is conducted, including policy evaluation and comparison, scheme optimization and design, and specific transport behavior interventions. The results show that existing upstream policies are insufficient in stringency and effectiveness, while policy implementation for downstream interventions remains limited. To address these shortcomings, this study proposes a downstream ground transportation emissions trading system (GTETS), incorporating the Internet of Things and blockchain technology. As well as road and rail transportation emissions, the system includes the emissions-related activities of individuals and transportation companies, and its Web3-based technologies provide effective and efficient monitoring, reporting, and verification.}

The most common solution to offer a familiar experience to naive users are custodial intermediaries, which have the important drawback of centralizing the process, and keeping users away from the advantages of self-sovereign assets control. In this paper, we present a process for the distribution of digital tokens to end users, exploiting “physical” objects for initial distribution. The process is aimed at making the onboarding of users not yet accustomed to blockchain tools and concepts as easy as possible, in a secure and decentralized way.}

Firstly, a notary election mechanism is proposed to choose one notary from the notary group to act as a bridge for cross-chain transactions. Secondly, a margin pool is introduced to limit the misconduct of the elected notary and ensure the value transfer between the involved blockchains. Moreover, a reputation based incentive mechanism is used to encourage members of the notary group to participate in cross-chain transactions. Ethereum-based experiments demonstrate that the proposed mechanism can provide an acceptable performance for cross-chain transactions and provide a higher security level than ordinary cross-chain mechanisms.}

abstract = {Smart contracts are widely used on the blockchain to implement complex transactions, such as decentralized applications on Ethereum. Effective vulnerability detection of large-scale smart contracts is critical, as attacks on smart contracts often cause huge economic losses. Since it is difficult to repair and update smart contracts, it is necessary to find the vulnerabilities before they are deployed. However, code analysis, which requires traversal paths, and learning methods, which require many features to be trained, are too time-consuming to detect large-scale on-chain contracts. Learning-based methods will obtain detection models from a feature space compared to code analysis methods such as symbol execution. But the existing features lack the interpretability of the detection results and training model, even worse, the large-scale feature space also affects the efficiency of detection. This paper focuses on improving the detection efficiency by reducing the dimension of the features, combined with expert knowledge. In this paper, a feature extraction model Block-gram is proposed to form low-dimensional knowledge-based features from bytecode. First, the metadata is separated and the runtime code is converted into a sequence of opcodes, which are divided into segments based on some instructions (jumps, etc.). Then, scalable Block-gram features, including 4-dimensional block features and 8-dimensional attribute features, are mined for the learning-based model training. Finally, feature contributions are calculated from SHAP values to measure the relationship between our features and the results of the detection model. In addition, six types of vulnerability labels are made on a dataset containing 33,885 contracts, and these knowledge-based features are evaluated using seven state-of-the-art learning algorithms, which show that the average detection latency speeds up 25× to 650×, compared with the features extracted by N-gram, and also can enhance the interpretability of the detection model.}

This dynamic landscape is characterized by a myriad of innovative solutions, ranging from decentralized finance and supply chain management to digital identity and voting systems, each contributing to the ongoing advancement and adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors. Achieving interoperability among these applications and platforms poses a significant challenge due to their use of distinct protocols, and remains a bottleneck hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. Addressing this challenge requires designing a universal interoperability protocol while ensuring compliance with the security and privacy constraints specific to each blockchain, thus adding complexity. We propose an agnostic interoperability protocol designed for seamless asset movement across independent private blockchain networks, regardless of their individual protocols. This protocol leverages incentive-driven smart contract and Zero-Knowledge Proofs to establish a decentralized, secure, and privacy-focused framework for interoperability. We conduct a security analysis using game theory and provide both theoretical and empirical evaluations of the protocol end-to-end delay. Through a comprehensive use case, we demonstrate the secure deployment of the proposed protocol for asset movement between two private blockchains. We also discuss the trade-offs between cost and delay in cross-blockchain transactions. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing interoperability schemes showcases the proposed interoperability scheme superiority in terms of robustness, privacy preservation, and verifiability.}

abstract = {In this paper, an integrated blockchain-based energy management platform is proposed that optimizes energy flows in a microgrid whilst implementing a bilateral trading mechanism. Physical constraints in the microgrid are respected by formulating an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, which is combined with a bilateral trading mechanism in a single optimization problem. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the problem to enable distributed optimization and a smart contract is used as a virtual aggregator. This eliminates the need for a third-party coordinating entity. The smart contract fulfills several functions, including distribution of data to all participants and executing part of the ADMM algorithm. The model is run using actual data from a prosumer community in Amsterdam and several scenarios of the model are tested to evaluate the impact of combining physical constraints and trading on social welfare of the community and scheduling of energy flows. The scenario variants are trade-only, where only a trading mechanism is implemented, grid-only where only OPF optimization is implemented and a combined scenario where both are implemented. Results are compared with a baseline scenario. Simulation results show that import costs of the whole community are reduced by 34.9% as compared to a baseline scenario, and total energy import quantities are reduced by 15%. Total social welfare is found to be highest without a trading mechanism, however this platform is only viable when all costs are equally shared between all households. Furthermore, peak imports are reduced by over 50% in scenarios including grid constraints.}

abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework that reflects the current state of thinking on tokenizing circularity in agri-food systems. The framework is built upon classifications of tokens and the key principles of circular economy and shows how tokenization can support circularity in agri-food systems through the flows of information and flows of value. Based on an integrative review of literature on tokenization, blockchain and the circular economy and multiple case studies in the agri-food domain, we show the relevance of tokenization to the circular economy in three ways: 1) enhancing traceability of physical and digital objects in supply chains; 2) improving transparency and credibility of circularity claims; 3) facilitating collaborative business ecosystems with incentives for more circular production and distribution. Based on the framework, we derive important research questions for future research agenda on tokenizing circularity in agri-food systems.}

The system is highly redundant and distributed, making it very difficult for fraudulent financial transactions. While cryptocurrencies might be the most well-known use case of blockchain technology, it is wrong to assume that this technology is restricted to the financial area. Indeed, many blockchain use cases are being developed today in different areas. Due to the complexity of certain processes, a new technology associated to blockchain has appeared – smart contracts. These digital contracts act like traditional contracts, with the major difference being their automaticity. In this article, we aim to discuss how blockchain and smart contracts may be used together in order to improve organizational operations. More specifically, we demonstrate how these technologies might be used to develop a solution that avoids certain types of fraud in the area of vehicle insurance.}

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have quickly become an important part of the blockchain economy, theoretically representing ownership of a digital asset registered on a public blockchain such as Ethereum. While several applications of this technology exist, the key underlying factor in NFTs’ success is in their potential for investment – buying, selling, and trading the digital assets such as artwork or video game items using cryptocurrency. The rise and mid-2022 crash of NFT and associated crypto markets have shown the volatility of the sector, and questions have been raised around the sustainability, environmental impact, and exploitative practices within this space – and whether there are, in fact, any possible socially responsible use cases for NFTs. This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature surrounding NFTs, primarily through a thorough ethical analysis of the technology and its implementation, deployment, and sustainability. To do this, it uses the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct as a framework for analysis and, following this analysis, makes some recommendations for those wishing to investigate and/or implement NFTs in an ethically responsible manner. The key message is that unless there is absolutely no other way to solve a problem other than using NFTs, then they should not be implemented, as there is currently no ethical use case or means of implementation of NFTs.}

abstract = {Supply chain traceability is one of the most promising use cases to benefit from characteristics of blockchain, such as decentralization, immutability and transparency, not required to build prior trust relationships among entities. A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked.}

This paper explores and discusses how NFTs, analysed through the lens of the Technology Organisation Environment (TOE) framework, can drive supply chain sustainability and overcome the barriers to Blockchain Technology (BCT) adoption. We elucidate the unique value proposition of NFTs and explore the potential of ‘phygital products’ for linking digital NFTs to physical goods. Based on the existing literature and a review of real-world case studies, we propose that NFTs can (1) incentivise supply chain stakeholders to engage in more sustainable practices; (2) enhance customer willingness to pay for sustainable products; (3) provide anti-counterfeit measures; (4) support circular business model growth. A sustainable 'Mint-to-Order' production strategy starting with the creation (minting) of an NFT is proposed based on a synthesis of the findings. The use of NFTs has significant implications for both digital and physical product offerings and sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practice making a compelling case for adoption. This paper is one of the first to explore the potential of using NFTs to drive sustainability in supply chains forming an essential component of a metaverse nexus and delineating a future research agenda.}

However, little is still known about the main drivers of cryptocurrency ownership, especially in emerging markets. Based on a representative online survey among 573 Brazilian digital platform investors, we find that crypto investors tend to be young, male, more tolerant to risk, less optimistic in their economic views, and consider themselves as ‘better’ investors compared to non-crypto online traders. While crypto and non-crypto investors have similar edu-cational backgrounds, our results show that cryptocurrency literacy positively and strongly relates to cryptocurrency ownership and intentions to invest in cryptocurrency. A gender gap among cryptocurrency investors has been confirmed. The findings further suggest that sophisticated in-vestors are more likely to hedge pessimistic economic expectations using cryptocurrency than their unsophisticated peers. We also find significant heterogeneity among cryptocurrency investors (e.g., early x late adopters) on attitudes and beliefs. The insights into digital investors' intentions to invest in cryptocurrency can be valuable for policymakers in designing strategies for the broader adoption of digital assets in the era of a decentralized economy, considering the planned adoption of CBDC in Brazil.}

Clear disclosures are associated with higher abnormal returns, in contrast to Vague ones leading to a milder response by investors in the days surrounding the disclosure. Early adopters and large-cap firms earn higher abnormal returns immediately following Metaverse disclosures than do late adopters and small-cap companies. Although the Metaverse may represent a potential growth engine for firms in the future, we document a short-term positive overreaction in share price behavior that is completely reversed within the 30 days following the announcements, regardless of the size of companies, the timing of the disclosure, or whether the disclosure was Clear or Vague.}

In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) maintains users’ assets by smart contracts in a decentralized manner, but introduces additional overhead in terms of gas fee and transaction confirmation latency. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the benefits of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is criticized for two issues. First, trading transactions are time-consuming and expensive for frequent token traders. Second, excessive simultaneous transactions might cause the pending transaction congestion in the Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate the pending transaction congestion. Besides, we propose the very first gas-price vs. transaction-confirmation-latency function to guide Ethereum transaction issuers to choose an optimal gas price that minimizes the overall cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the cost in the proposed HEX with that in the conventional HEX. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing gas fees and transaction confirmation latency for frequent traders as well as the pending transaction congestion in Ethereum.}

Data was collected in Pakistan and China through judgmental sampling from 384 respondents. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the collected data. The findings validate the relationship between perceived ease of use and the adoption of metaverse with β-value 0.236, t-value 5.207 and p-value 0.000, the relationship between perceived usefulness and the adoption of metaverse with β-value 0.233, t-value 4.017 and p-value 0.000, and the relationship between trust and adoption of a metaverse with β-value 0.192, t-value 3.589 and p-value 0.000. Results also show that the digital divide moderates the relation between perceived ease of use and adopting the metaverse having β-value 0.078, t-value 1.848 and p-value 0.032. Similarly, the findings also show that the digital divide does not moderate the relationships of perceived usefulness and trust with adopting the metaverse. Moreover, the meta culture also does not moderate the relationships of perceived ease of use, usefulness, and trust with adopting the metaverse. The study contributes to theoretical research on adopting a metaverse in healthcare by examining various factors necessary for its development. It also provides guidelines for the developers and adopters of suitable metaverse technology.}

Consequently, the need for interoperability among these systems has become paramount, particularly in a trustless manner. To enable decentralized and secure cross-chain applications for users, the establishment of a trust-minimized interoperability solution is imperative for homogeneous blockchain-based networks. This paper presents an analysis of the current state and challenges associated with interoperability between blockchain-based systems. Building upon previous research, we propose that the set of blockchain-based networks should be narrowed down based on the same settlement layer for supporting trust-minimized interoperability. Specifically, we concentrate on the cross-rollup functionality between rollups. We have devised and implemented two similar solutions to address the aforementioned interoperability problem, employing a trust-minimized optimistic approach. Through extensive experimentation, we compare our proposed solutions with existing cross-rollup bridges in terms of gas consumption, time complexity, and newly introduced trust assumptions. Our experimental investigations concentrate on the transmission of arbitrary data utilizing non-fungible tokens. The results reveal that one of our proposed solutions offers an optimal approach for cross-rollup communication between optimistic rollups.}

Additionally, we used the Diebold and Yilmaz (DY) spillover index of variance decomposition to validate our findings. Evidence from the analysis suggests positive short- and long-run effects of historical S&P500 returns on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Tether returns––and negative short- and long-run effects of the historical returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Binance, and Tether on S&P500 returns. Alternatively, evidence suggests a negative short- and long-run effect of historical S&P500 returns on Binance returns. The cumulative test of impulse-response indicates a shock in historical S&P500 returns stimulates a positive response from cryptocurrency returns while a shock in historical crypto returns triggers a negative response from S&P500 returns. Empirical evidence of bi-directional causality between S&P500 returns and crypto returns suggest the mutual coupling of these market. Although, S&P500 returns have high-intensity spillover effects on crypto returns than crypto returns have on S&P500. This contradicts the fundamental attribute of cryptocurrencies for hedging and diversification of assets to reduce risk exposure. Our findings demonstrate the need to monitor and implement appropriate regulatory policies in the crypto market to mitigate the potential risks of financial contagion.}

While IIoT brings us much convenience, a series of security and scalability issues related to permission operations rise to the surface during device communications. Hence, at present, a reliable and dynamic access control management system for IIoT is in urgent need. Up till now, numerous access control architectures have been proposed for IIoT. However, owing to centralized models and heterogeneous devices, security and scalability requirements still cannot be met. In this paper, we offer a smart contract token-based solution for decentralized access control in IIoT systems. Specifically, there are three smart contracts in our system, including the Token Issue Contract (TIC), User Register Contract (URC), and Manage Contract (MC). These three contracts collaboratively supervise and manage various events in IIoT environments. We also utilize the lightweight and post-quantum encryption algorithm-Nth-degree Truncated Polynomial Ring Units (NTRU) to preserve user privacy during the registration process. Subsequently, to evaluate our proposed architecture's performance, we build a prototype platform that connects to the local blockchain. Finally, experiment results show that our scheme has achieved secure and dynamic access control for the IIoT system compared with related research.}

abstract = {Programming errors in Ethereum smart contracts can result in catastrophic financial losses from stolen cryptocurrency. While vulnerability detectors can prevent vulnerable contracts from being deployed, this does not mean that such contracts will not be deployed. Once a vulnerable contract is instantiated on the blockchain and becomes the target of attacks, the identification of exploit transactions becomes indispensable in assessing whether it has been actually exploited and identifying which malicious or subverted accounts were involved. In this work, we study the problem of post-factum investigation of Ethereum attacks using Indicators of Compromise (IoC) specially crafted for use in the blockchain. IoC definitions need to capture the side-effects of successful exploitation in the context of the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, we define a model for smart contract execution, comprising multiple abstraction levels that mirror the multiple views of code execution on a blockchain. Subsequently, we compare IoCs defined across the different levels in terms of their effectiveness and practicality through EtherClue, a prototype tool for investigating Ethereum security incidents. Our results illustrate that coarse-grained IoCs defined over blocks of transactions can detect exploit transactions with less computation. However, they are contract-specific and suffer from false negatives. On the other hand, fine-grained IoCs defined over virtual machine instructions can avoid these pitfalls at the expense of increased computation, which is nevertheless applicable for practical use.}

abstract = {The emergence of on-demand service provisioning by Federated Cloud Providers (FCPs) to Cloud Users (CU) has fuelled significant innovations in cloud provisioning models. Owing to the massive traffic, massive CU resource requests are sent to FCPs, and appropriate service recommendations are sent by FCPs. Currently, the Fourth-Generation (4G)-Long Term Evolution (LTE) network faces bottlenecks that affect end-user throughput and latency. Moreover, the data is exchanged among heterogeneous stakeholders, and thus trust is a prime concern. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a Blockchain (BC)-leveraged rank-based recommender scheme, FedRec, to expedite secure and trusted Cloud Service Provisioning (CSP) to the CU through the FCP at the backdrop of base 5G communication service. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a BC-integrated request-response broker model is formulated between the CU, Cloud Brokers (BR), and the FCP, where a CU service request is forwarded through the BR to different FCPs. For service requests, Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) is supported by 5G-enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) service. In the next phase, a weighted matching recommender model is proposed at the FCP sites based on a novel Ranking-Based Recommender (RBR) model based on the CU requests. In the final phase, based on the matching recommendations between the CU and the FCP, Smart Contracts (SC) are executed, and resource provisioning data is stored in the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS) that expedite the block validations. The proposed scheme FedRec is compared in terms of SC evaluation and formal verification. In simulation, FedRec achieves a reduction of 27.55% in chain storage and a transaction throughput of 43.5074 Mbps at 150 blocks. For the IPFS, we have achieved a bandwidth improvement of 17.91%. In the RBR models, the maximum obtained hit ratio is 0.9314 ​at 200 million CU requests, showing an improvement of 1.2% in average servicing latency over non-RBR models and a maximization trade-off of QoE index of 2.7688 at the flow request 1.088 and at granted service price of USD 1.559 million to FCP for provided services. The obtained results indicate the viability of the proposed scheme against traditional approaches.}

abstract = {Bangladesh is a small country with a large population. Its increasingly developing economy further makes land a lucrative source of fixed capital. On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people. As a result, the current model suffers from good governance. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information. As a result, Blockchain adoption can improve the land title digitization effort of Bangladesh.}

abstract = {With the development of the energy Internet, more distributed generators are connected to the power grid, resulting in numerous heterogeneous energy networks. However, different energy networks cannot perform efficient energy trading in the centralized management mode, this deeply affecting the complementary ability of heterogeneous energy, resulting in the islanded energy phenomenon. In this model, the same energy on the chain is traded within the chain, and the heterogeneous energy on different chains is traded across chains. To trade energy between heterogeneous energy networks more efficiently, the blockchain-based cross-chain model is proposed based on the existing infrastructure. Heterogeneous energy nodes are assigned to different energy sub-chains and cross-chain energy transactions are performed through a relay-chain, which utilizes the improved Boneh–Lynn–Shacham signature scheme consensus algorithm based on the proof-of-stake and practical Byzantine fault tolerance. The experimental simulations on energy trading efficiency, throughput, and security, show its superiority over existing systems. Further, the simulation results provide a reference for the application of cross-chain technology in energy interconnection.}

abstract = {Cyber-enabled fraud has transformed, becoming more complex and making it harder for targets and law enforcement to detect its occurrence. This study aims to recontextualize a major manifestation of this transformation, a crime called hybrid investment fraud, colloquially known as pig butchering. Hybrid investment fraud describes a cyber-enabled fraud whereby criminals gain the trust of victims by forming connections and relationships, and then exploit this trust by using a series of confidence building and coercive measures designed to encourage victims to continuously invest in securities or commodities until they become unable or unwilling to continue to make payments or the offenders become unreachable. This study further aims to address the existing knowledge gap by focusing on understudied elements of this fraud, such victim and offender characteristics and the ways hybrid investment fraud is perpetrated. To achieve this, we conducted an in-depth analysis of more than 1,300 news articles and court documents between January 1, 2018, and November 1, 2023, to identify 59 cases of hybrid investment fraud targeting victims in the United States. This article both situates hybrid investment fraud within the broader fraud literature and conducts a comprehensive of analysis of hybrid investment fraud cases to identify the types of hybrid investment fraud committed, their impact, victim and offender demographics, and offenders’ tactics, tools, and methods of operation. The findings from this study can inform criminal justice practices and future research of this fraud.}

Continuous authentication was introducing to be superior to traditional authentication schemes by constantly verify users’ identities on an ongoing basis and spot the moment at which an illicit attacker seizes control of the session. However, several challenges remain unsolved. This research aims to investigate the power of Blockchain technology to provide real-time and non-intrusive continuous authentication for the IoT environment. Accordingly, a distributed and scalable continuous authentication solution based on Blockchain technology called CAB-IoT was proposed. It enabled fog nodes layer that tackles the limitations of IoT resources by providing localized processing of heavy continuous authentication-related tasks for a group of IoT devices. Besides, CAB-IoT introduced a trust module that depends on the face recognition machine learning model to detect outliers and abnormal access. Moreover, mutual authentication between end-users and fog nodes is also designed, as well as secure communication between the authenticated nodes. The results demonstrate a lightweight continuous authentication solution that achieved the desired balance between security and performance requirements where it was observed in a real-world environment for truly performance results. Security analysis and attack analysis are also considered during the evaluation.}

The concept originated initially as a token standard of Ethereum, an open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, where each token is characterized by distinguishable signs. These types of tokens have unique digital properties that allow their distinct identification. NFTs, with their distinct qualities, can be fluidly traded with customized values according to their ages, rarity, and liquidity. The trading of NFTs has heavily influenced the growth of the decentralized application (dApp) marketplace, as exponential returns (thousand folds from their original value) on its ever-expanding market are being observed, leading to worldwide attention. However, the NFT ecosystem is in its nascence, and the associated technologies are still in their infancy. New researchers might be fascinated with the exponential, yet nebulous evolution of NFTs; however, this novelty has contributed to the paucity of systematic and conclusive published research work on this topic. This review portrays the NFT ecosystem multidimensionally, wherein the paper commences with an overview of state-of-the-art NFT technology and furnishes summary standards and desired properties. Finally, the study concludes with an elaborate discussion of the future outlook for and prime challenges faced by NFTs.}
