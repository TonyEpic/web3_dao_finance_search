abstract = {This paper proposes a cloud based public key infrastructure utilizing blockchain technology model for replacing the currently outdated traditional variant. Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6\% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87\%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface.},

abstract = {This paper describes the proof of concept of a blockchain based organization of a local low voltage energy community. The focus of the concept is efficient use of shared resources to minimize external dependence, and not energy trading. A previously proposed control algorithm, which exploits the power dependency of the efficiency of electrical energy storages, is implemented as a smart contract on a private instance of an Ethereum blockchain to coordinate the operation. It is implemented using four connected Raspberry Pis representing the participating households with pre-given electrical load and photovoltaic conversion as well as a battery. Each household runs an Ethereum full node and an interfacing software. Only the energy technology components are simulated, while the blockchain is actually running on the Raspberry Pis in order to mind the full complexity of the technology. The practicability is proved in a test run and positive effects on the efficiency and the self-sufficiency within the community are observed. A first cost-benefit estimate is given and a further research agenda is presented.},

abstract = {We study the competition between blockchains in a multi-chain environment, where a dominant EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) co-exists with an alternative EVM-compatible (e.g., Avalanche) and an EVM-incompatible (e.g., Algorand) blockchain. While EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum users and developers to migrate more easily over to the alternative layer-1, EVM incompatibility might allow the firms to build more loyal and "sticky'' user base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such, the choice to be EVM-compatible is not merely a technological decision, but also an important strategic decision. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and find that at equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain. To avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice can take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network effects. We find that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract users through direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract users through offering better features/products.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent deeds of ownership, based on blockchain technologies and smart contracts, of unique crypto assets on digital art forms (e.g., artworks or collectibles). In the spotlight after skyrocketing in 2021, NFTs have attracted the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors intent on placing promising investments in this profitable market. However, the NFT financial performance prediction has not been widely explored to date. In this work, we address the above problem based on the hypothesis that NFT images and their textual descriptions are essential proxies to predict the NFT selling prices. To this purpose, we propose MERLIN, a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed to train Transformer-based language and visual models, along with graph neural network models, on collections of NFTs’ images and texts. A key aspect in MERLIN is its independence on financial features, as it exploits only the primary data a user interested in NFT trading would like to deal with, i.e., NFT images and textual descriptions. By learning dense representations of such data, a price-category classification task is performed by MERLIN models, which can also be tuned according to user preferences in the inference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles. Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset has shown that MERLIN models achieve significant performances according to several financial assessment criteria, fostering profitable investments, and also beating baseline machine-learning classifiers based on financial features.},

Enthusiasts claim DAOs provide new opportunities for openness, horizontality, and democratization. However, this phenomenon is still under research, especially given the lack of quantitative studies. This paper presents the first census-like quantitative analysis of the whole ecosystem of DAOs, including 30K DAO communities on the main DAO platforms. This enables us to provide insights into the allegedly "democratic'' nature of DAOs, building metrics concerning their lifespan, participation, and power concentration. Most DAOs have a short lifespan and low participation. There is also a positive correlation between community size and voting power concentration. Like other online communities, DAOs seem to follow the iron law: becoming increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Still, a significant amount of DAOs of varying sizes defy this idea by being egalitarian by design.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of IoT devices makes the delivery mechanism of security updates a challenge. Current IoT systems rely on centralized or brokered paradigms or clouds with huge computational and storage capacities. The existing centralized IoT setups are therefore expensive as the result of factors such as the high costs associated with cloud server and network infrastructures and maintenance. Thus, the need for a fully decentralized peer to peer and secure technology to overcome these problems rises into the realm of existence. Blockchain provides a solution that fulfills the requirements of such a platform. Ideally, the update infrastructure should implement the CIA triad properties (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). In this article, we study how a blockchain application can meet these requirements and propose a novel system to decentrally distribute digital content in a peer-to-peer network using the blockchain technology and smart contracts to overcome the concerns mentioned above. Additionally, in order to prevent the issues stemming from the free-riding challenge in P2P networks (peers refrain to generously share their resources to distribute updates), we exploit a Nash equilibrium micropayment mechanism to grant adequate incentive for peers to participate in distributing IoT update files.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution for training using data collected from heterogeneous sources (e.g., mobile devices) while avoiding the transmission of large amounts of raw data and preserving privacy. Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that the integration of blockchain and smart contract technologies to FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present FL-MAB (FL- Multi-Auction using Blockchain), a client selection mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. FL-MAB employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract. This allows FL-MAB to measure the relative contribution of each client by calculating a Shapley value, and allocating rewards accordingly. We have implemented FL-MAB using Solidity and tested on the Ethereum blockchain with various popular datasets. Our results show that FL-MAB outperforms existing baseline schemes by improving accuracy and reducing the no. of FL rounds.},

In order to avoid unreasonably rising costs due to inefficient utilization of the electricity infrastructure, we propose EVA: a scheduling system to solve the valley filling problem by distributing the electricity demand generated by electric vehicles in a geographically limited area efficiently over time spans in which the electric grid is underutilized. EVA is based on a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain in combination with off-chain computational nodes performing the schedule calculation using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This allows for a high degree of transparency and verifiability in the scheduling computation results while maintaining a reasonable level of efficiency. In order to interact with the scheduling system, we developed a decentralized app with a graphical frontend, where the user can enter vehicle information and future energy requirements as well as review upcoming schedules. The calculation of the schedule is performed on a daily basis, continuously providing schedules for participating users for the following day.},

Reliable machine-to-machine automatic transactions, such as auctions, bidding, and payments, utilise the immense potential of blockchain technology. Researchers are exploring blockchain-based applications for automobiles and transportation, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and highway user fee payment. The use of blockchain eliminates the need for third parties in transactions. This paper presents a proof of concept for using EVs as energy storage in a smart grid system. Generators, consumers, and distributed energy resources (DER), such as solar and wind, make up the elements of a smart grid. We propose storing the surplus power generated by DER in the electric vehicle's battery. When the generation is less, or there is high demand, these EVs can supply the stored energy back to the grid. We use blockchain smart contracts and Ethereum cryptocurrency to monitor and monetise the process. We also make a cost comparison of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs, analysing the financial benefits of employing the suggested method in EV charging instead of more conventional charging methods.},

abstract = {Ethereum is a popular account-based blockchain whose number of accounts and transactions has skyrocketed, causing its data explosion. As a result, ordinary clients using PCs or smartphones cannot easily bootstrap as a full node, but rely on other full nodes to verify transactions, thus being exposed to security risks. The most serious overhead is caused by synchronizing the state of all accounts in the block's state trie, which takes several tens of gigabytes. Observing that more than 95\% of the accounts are dormant, we propose a novel state optimization technique, named Ethanos. Ethanos downsizes the state trie by periodically emptying it, and then re-build it only with the active accounts used in the period's transactions. Ethanos runs transactions using the accounts available in the current period's state trie as well as those available at the end of the previous period's state trie. For an account in neither of the tries, the account first restores itself by transmitting a restore transaction. One important result of this state management is that a node can now bootstrap only with the latest period's state trie, yet can fully verify all transactions thereafter. We evaluated Ethanos with real Ethereum transactions for 300,000 blocks from the 7.0 million block, with a one-week period of emptying the state trie. Our result shows that Ethanos can sharply reduce the state trie, with only a tiny fraction of the restore transactions. More importantly, unlike the Ethereum state trie which continues to grow as time goes on, the Ethanos state trie size at the end of each period is bounded by a few hundred MB, when there are more than one million, one-week-active accounts.},

Transactions are grouped in blocks, and every execution of the block must yield the same deterministic outcome. Block-STM further enforces that the outcome is consistent with executing transactions according to a preset order, leveraging this order to dynamically detect dependencies and avoid conflicts during speculative transaction execution. At the core of Block-STM is a novel, low-overhead collaborative scheduler of execution and validation tasks.Block-STM is implemented on the main branch of the Diem Blockchain code-base and runs in production at Aptos. Our evaluation demonstrates that Block-STM is adaptive to workloads with different conflict rates and utilizes the inherent parallelism therein. Block-STM achieves up to 110k tps in the Diem benchmarks and up to 170k tps in the Aptos Benchmarks, which is a 20x and 17x improvement over the sequential baseline with 32 threads, respectively. The throughput on a contended workload is up to 50k tps and 80k tps in Diem and Aptos benchmarks, respectively.},

abstract = {As Web3 projects leverage airdrops to incentivize participation, airdrop hunters tactically amass wallet addresses to capitalize on token giveaways. This poses challenges to the decentralization goal. Current detection approaches tailored for cryptocurrencies overlook non-fungible tokens (NFTs) nuances. We introduce ARTEMIS, an optimized graph neural network system for identifying airdrop hunters in NFT transactions. ARTEMIS captures NFT airdrop hunters through: (1) a multimodal module extracting visual and textual insights from NFT metadata using Transformer models; (2) a tailored node aggregation function chaining NFT transaction sequences, retaining behavioral insights; (3) engineered features based on market manipulation theories detecting anomalous trading. Evaluated on decentralized exchange Blur's data, ARTEMIS significantly outperforms baselines in pinpointing hunters. This pioneering computational solution for an emergent Web3 phenomenon has broad applicability for blockchain anomaly detection.

abstract = {Without relying on centralized intermediaries to participate in financial services such as exchanging and lending assets, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has set off a new paradigm of asset self-management. On the other hand, data as an emerging asset becomes increasingly significant in our daily life. How to self-manage our data assets to raise their value deserves further exploration. Inspired by DeFi, we envision a decentralized eco-system/community where people can donate or trade data end-to-end for the public good and/or maximize data value. This paper explores this vision by building a DeFi-based data sharing and trading system. In order to explore the actual value of data in the market, we propose an elastic data pricing scheme that can dynamically adjust data prices based on data usage and timing. Finally, we implement and integrate these critical components into a prototyping system deployed onto Ethereum - the current leading blockchain system, and evaluate the system service performance, smart contracts functionality, and the robustness of the data pricing scheme.},

abstract = {Web3 applications based on blockchains regularly need access to randomness that is unbiased, unpredictable, and publicly verifiable. For Web3 gaming applications, this becomes a crucial selling point to attract more users by providing credibility to the "random reward" distribution feature. A verifiable random function (VRF) protocol satisfies these requirements naturally, and there is a tremendous rise in the use of VRF services. As most blockchains cannot maintain the secret keys required for VRFs, Web3 applications interact with external VRF services via a smart contract where a VRF output is exchanged for a fee. While this smart contract-based plain-text exchange offers the much-needed public verifiability immediately, it severely limits the way the requester can employ the VRF service: the requests cannot be made in advance, and the output cannot be reused. This introduces significant latency and monetary overhead.This work overcomes this crucial limitation of the VRF service by introducing a novel privacy primitive Output Private VRF ( Pri-VRF) and thereby adds significantly more flexibility to the Web3-based VRF services. We call our framework FlexiRand. While maintaining the pseudo-randomness and public verifiability properties of VRFs, FlexiRand ensures that the requester alone can observe the VRF output. The smart contract and anybody else can only observe a blinded-yet-verifiable version of the output. We formally define Pri-VRF, put forward a practically efficient design, and provide provable security analysis in the universal composability (UC) framework (in the random oracle model) using a variant of one-more Diffie-Hellman assumption over bilinear groups.As the VRF service, with its ownership of the secret key, becomes a single point of failure, it is realized as a distributed VRF with the key secret-shared across distinct nodes in our framework. We develop our distributed Pri-VRF construction by combining approaches from Distributed VRF and Distributed Oblivious PRF literature. We provide provable security analysis (in UC), implement it and compare its performance with existing distributed VRF schemes. Our distributed Pri-VRF only introduces a minimal computation and communication overhead for the VRF service, the requester, and the contract.},

abstract = {Traceability is one of the most sought-after properties for supply chains because it facilitates a plethora of use cases like food recalls, counterfeit detection, and quality improvement by tracing the history of a product. Recently proposed traceability solutions rely heavily on blockchain technology because it offers data immutability and transparency. However, these solutions suffer from two significant limitations. Firstly, they do not validate traceability data for accuracy and completeness. So, how can we be sure that the data on the blockchain is correct and complete? Secondly, they provide a limited threat model or none at all. So, how can we be sure that the trace for a product has not been altered by an adversary? To summarise, we propose ForTrac, an Ethereum-based forward traceability system for generic physical products. Each product is digitally represented as an ERC-721 token. In a forward traceability system, traces are built correctly by design. ForTrac uses a valid predicate that states the sequence of steps a product has to follow and how much time each step can maximally take. We show that ForTrac is secure. Unlike previous work, our security analysis is not restricted to only the blockchain component. It also includes the communication protocol between the product reader, server, and smart contract. We show that our communication protocol guarantees data agreement between the reader and smart contract using Scyther. Finally, we demonstrate that our prototype is feasible by assessing costs and performance. By using forward traceability and including a detailed security analysis we provide accuracy and completeness. Our valid predicate documents which events have to be collected for a trace to be complete. Data accuracy is provided by showing that the smart contract agrees with the data sent by the reader.},

abstract = {Agriculture is the lifeline of Indian economy which contributes to 22\% of the GDP, provides 58\% employment, and sustains 69\% of the population. However, agricultural production comes with various risk factors beyond human control. Farmers are highly exposed to risk and it is aggravated by the limited span of risk mitigation instruments such as insurance where there is a lack of participation from the private sector and the claim payout procedure is very lengthy, due to which the farmer cannot initiate new cropping activity or it is delayed. There is no proper and adequate provision of security for crops grown by Indian farmers and despite increasing vulnerability, they have not yet fully developed the capacity to mitigate risk effectively. There is a need to design innovative insurance products to balance the interests of the insurer as well as the insured. With the Prime Minister's call to be "self sufficient" or "aatmanirbhar", in this paper we present a decentralised peer-to-peer crop insurance framework which enables to overcome the current disadvantages by securing farmers' interests, eliminating intermediaries and providing a secure, standardized, and transparent system that does not hinder any information from stakeholders. Through blockchain technology, the system promotes trust in a trust less environment wherein the farmers and the private investors go into a contract. The investors pool their investments and provide cover for the farmers, thus help the nation become self sufficient and help the farmers prosper.},

On-chain execution is expensive, with miners charging fees for distributed execution according to a cost model defined in the protocol. In particular, transactions have a high fixed cost. In this paper we present MultiCall, an interpreter that reduces the cost of smart contract execution by emulating sequences of transactions from multiple users in one transaction. We have implemented and integrated MultiCall into Ethereum. Our evaluation shows that using MultiCall provides a saving between 56.8\% and 98.9\% of the fixed per-transaction cost compared to the standard approach of sending transactions individually.},

abstract = {We propose Shard Scheduler, a system for object placement and migration in account-based sharded blockchains. Our system calculates optimal placement and decides on object migrations across shards. It supports complex multi-account transactions caused by smart contracts. Placement and migration decisions made by Shard Scheduler are fully deterministic, verifiable, and can be made part of the consensus protocol. Shard Scheduler reduces the number of costly cross-shard transactions, ensures balanced load distribution and maximizes the number of processed transactions for the blockchain as a whole. To this end, it leverages a novel incentive model motivating miners to maximize the global throughput of the entire blockchain rather than the throughput of a specific shard. In our simulations, Shard Scheduler can reduce the number of costly cross-shard transactions by half while ensuring equal load and increasing throughput more than 2 fold when using 60 shards. We also implement and evaluate Shard Scheduler on Chainspace, more than doubling its throughput and reducing user-perceived latency by 70\% when using 10 shards.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a, namely, asynchronous chain and presents a Variable Bulk Arrival and Asynchronous Bulk Service (VBAABS) model of the type in order to provide a quantitative method to design an asynchronous chain as a basis in its initial theoretical design stage. Note that the proposed chain is precisely and namely asynchronous along with adaptive-sized blocks in a proactive manner versus the conventional chain that controls the block posting in a strictly synchronous manner to the fixed-sized blocks. The model of the type (i.e., VBAVBS) is considered as the theoretical and quantitative baseline model for the proposed model, namely, an adaptive chain model, yet with a rather reactively dynamic size of blocks, while the proposed asynchronous model carries a proactively dynamic (or adaptive) size of blocks. The proposed asynchronous chain model assumes variable bulk arrivals of transactions in Poisson distribution, i.e., , where represents the number of slots across all the mined transactions, and variable asynchronous services of transactions, each of which applies to a block potentially of different capacity in terms of the number of slots in it, in exponential time, i.e., , for being posted in the current block, namely, VBAABS. The major quantitative distinction between the adaptive model, i.e., VBAVBS, and the asynchronous model, i.e., VBAABS, is that in VBAVBS, every state , where , transitions back into while in VBAABS, every state , where , transitions back into , where , as well as back into , and is the state in which the transaction up in execution is to be discarded, in other words, that the current block capacity is in excess of the required capacity for the transaction in execution to result in a potentially excessive delay as much as than an otherwise ordinarily fully synchronous block posting delay that is as much as . VBAABS will reveal the performance advantages of the asynchronous chain versus the baseline chain, i.e., VBASBS [30] and the adaptive chain, i.e., VBAVBS, with respect to the average time for a slot to wait in the block and the average spatial requirement by the slots in the block, in a quantitative manner. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted on Matlab. Further, for feasibility validation purpose, an asynchronous chain algorithm will be developed and implemented by redesigning the Ethereum open source and analyzed.},

abstract = {With the recent advent of blockchains, we have witnessed a plethora of blockchain proposals. These proposals range from using work to using time, storage or stake in order to select blocks to be appended to the chain. As a drawback it makes it difficult for the application developer to choose the right blockchain to support their applications. In particular, the scalability and performance one can obtain from a specific blockchain is typically unknown. The claimed results are often obtained in isolation by the developers of the blockchain themselves. The experimental conditions corresponding to these results are generally missing and the lack of details make these results irreproducible.In this paper, we propose the most extensive evaluation of blockchain to date. First, we show how the experimental settings impact the performance of 6 state-of-the-art blockchains and argue for more detailed experiments. Second, and to cope with this limitation, we propose a unifying framework to evaluate blockchains on the same ground. The framework includes a suite of 5 realistic Decentralized Applications (DApps), helps deploy the blockchain nodes at different scales and evaluate their performance. Finally, we show that selecting a particular virtual machine or weakening guarantees can help handle computationally demanding workloads but that none of the tested blockchains can yet support the load of these realistic DApps.},

abstract = {The anonymity, multi-show unlinkability, and selective disclosure property of anonymous credentials enables users to access third-party services without revealing unnecessary details or being profiled. Threshold-based anonymous credentials provide a distributed framework to issue these credentials. While all of this enhances privacy, anonymity can also be misused and some schemes, therefore, have an opening mechanism, which enables the authorities to trace a user's identity. Nevertheless, relying solely on this measure is inadequate as the users can continue to use their previously issued anonymous credentials to authenticate themselves successfully with the service providers. To address this issue, we propose a revocation mechanism for such schemes using dynamic threshold accumulators (DTA) (Helminger et al. 2021). We first formally define a generic threshold-based anonymous credentials with an opening scheme (TACO) and subsequently propose an extension of TACO, "Revocable TACO (RTACO)" - revocable threshold-based credentials over blockchains - that integrates a revocation mechanism based on DTAs to the TACO system. In RTACO, we integrate a revocation handle into the credential as an extra attribute, allowing the disclosure of this attribute during the opening phase, which is then used to blocklist the credential, preventing its further use. We formally prove the security of this scheme in the universal composability (UC) framework. We also give a proof-of-concept implementation of RTACO over the Ethereum blockchain.},

Current issues with real estate are the lack of asset information availability, and once data is retrieved, its veracity. Moreover, data can be out of data or artificially manipulated for an economic benefit. An example could be the fire alarm inspection logs. On the other hand, the main benefits of tokenisation are 1) decentralisation from a single source of authority, 2) encryption of data that avoids tampering, and 3) digital proof of ownership. The NFT registers real estate static and dynamic information to be traded in the data marketplace between the different users and stakeholders such as investors, occupiers, insurers and property managers. The information registered in the NFT contains real estate deeds, transactions and relevant parameters that change over time. The infrastructure of the proposed real estate NFT consists of a private token in a private blockchain entirely developed for this application rather than ERC-1155 or ERC-721; therefore, a new crypto token is created. Furthermore, the consensus protocol is a mixture between the proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms by choosing random validators with staked Cryptocurrency already, such as Ethereum. Experimental results show that the increment of the NFT at every transaction does not produce an equal increment of mining time or mining nonce, making the NFT predictable for higher complex models.},

Gifflar is structured in components that implement design patterns to better define the responsibility of each one of the parts and exports a simple interaction module for contract modeling in JSON and automatic code writing using the TypeScript language. As far as we know, this framework is one of the first to generate contracts dynamically at run time. Thus, the work contributes to the state of the art by addressing a new paradigm, where systems can act as smart contract developers.},

abstract = {Since the emergence of Ethereum, blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps) have become increasingly popular and important. To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework, \DH{}Archer, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have evaluated \DH{}Archer on 11 popular real-world DApps. \DH{}Archer achieves high precision (99.3\%), recall (87.6\%), and accuracy (89.4\%) in bug detection and significantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs in the 11 DApps. So far, six of the 15 bugs have been confirmed by the developers, and three have been fixed. These promising results demonstrate the usefulness of \DH{}Archer.},

abstract = {We introduce the forecasting technology behind Composable Finance's (Composable's)1 cross-layer cross-chain bridge Mosaic2 . Mosaic contains a network of vaults, one on each layer and chain, and we present our research into improving the operation and robustness of said bridge via liquidity forecasting of its associated vaults. Users utilize the bridge to transfer assets from a source network and source layer (a source vault) to a destination network and layer (a destination vault). However, if a vault is near depletion when a transfer is initiated the transfer can fail due to inefficient liquidity. Thus, critical to maximizing the user experience of Mosaic is being able to forecast accurately when the liquidity will be depleted from vaults supported by Mosaic. After introducing Mosaic, and without loss of generality, we forecast liquidity movements between three vaults: one on the layer 1 (L1) Ethereum mainnet, one on the L2 Polygon (POL) network, and one on the L2 Arbitrum (ARB) network. We demonstrate state of the art results from our statistical and AI methods that can consistently achieve low average errors (e.g., &lt;2\% liquidity) and high coverage (e.g., &gt;80\%) of the true liquidity levels in their 1-week-ahead forecast confidence intervals. As a baseline, we first develop autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for forecasting. The ARIMA models are optimized at each time step and provide conservative confidence intervals that allow us to safely assess the times when vaults will reach critical liquidity values and therefore, prevent depletion. To further enhance our forecasting framework, we also develop a machine learning approach with Gaussian Processes that can further capture time series trends, past replenishment events, where large discontinuities are present. Liquidity data for our forecasting methodologies will be provided in two levels of fidelity. We first introduce our in-house Liquidity Simulation Environment (LSE) - a state machine capable of running hypothetical vault liquidity scenarios under certain assumed cross-layer trades/swaps. Next, we forecast real-world data obtained from a recent PoC three-vault bridge setup run by Composable, and we apply the LSE to that. Finally, we provide our thoughts on forecasting beyond the PoC - our work will be of interest to layer 1, layer 2, cross-layer cross-chain, and AI researchers working on DeFi and blockchain technologies.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution for training using data collected from heterogeneous sources (e.g., mobile devices) while avoiding the transmission of large amounts of raw data and preserving privacy. Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that integrating blockchain and smart contract technologies into FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present Block-RACS (Blockchain-based Reputation Aware Client Selection), a mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. Block-RACS employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract. This allows Block-RACS to measure the relative contribution of each client by calculating a Shapley value and allocating rewards accordingly. Moreover, a blockchain-based reputation mechanism enables audibility and non-repudiation. The security analysis of the system is also presented to check the security vulnerabilities. We have implemented Block-RACS using Solidity and tested on the Ethereum blockchain with various popular datasets. Our results show that Block-RACS outperforms existing baseline schemes by improving accuracy and reducing the number of FL rounds.},

abstract = {Manipulation of user transactions by miners in permissionless blockchain systems is a growing concern. This problem is a pervasive and systemic issue that incurs high costs for users of decentralised applications and is known as Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Furthermore, transaction manipulations create other issues such as congestion, higher fees, and system instability. Detecting transaction manipulations is difficult, even though it is known that they originate from the pre-consensus phase of transaction selection for building blocks, at the base layer of blockchain protocols. In this paper, we summarize known transaction manipulation attacks. We present LO, an accountable base layer protocol designed to detect and mitigate transaction manipulations. LO is built around the accurate detection of transaction manipulations and assignment of blame at the granularity of a single mining node. LO forces miners to log all the transactions they receive into a secure mempool data structure and to process them in a verifiable manner. Overall, LO quickly and efficiently detects censorship, injection or re-ordering attempts. Our performance evaluation shows that LO is also practical and only introduces a marginal performance overhead.},

Blockchain allows different communities to create Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), which are self-organised democratic organisations controlled by smart contracts. This paper presents a new DAO model for the procurement of services by public organisations, such as government agencies. To demonstrate the advantages of this solution, this work looks specifically at current public procurement systems that resort to third-party contractors that manage these negotiations. Third parties lack the transparency, security, and democratic representation that a DAO can provide. We present the implementation of a DAO as a set of smart contracts executed on Ethereum-compatible permissionless blockchains, supported by a consensus algorithm, replacing third-party contractors.},

We propose the SafeMetaNet approach, which combines proximity-based authentication, encryption, and blockchain technology to establish secure data exchange in the IoT-Metaverse convergence. SafeMetaNet ensures data confidentiality and integrity through encryption and establishes a tamper-proof record of data exchange using blockchain technology. We evaluated the approach’s performance using various metrics, including latency, throughput, and two security metrics: data confidentiality and data integrity, and compared it with existing approaches. Our findings show that SafeMetaNet outperforms existing approaches, providing improved security. SafeMetaNet is a promising solution for secure data exchange in the IoT-Metaverse convergence.},

The ultimate aim is to alert people when a Covid-19-positive has been found and it occurs that they have been in close contact with the positive. In the context of contact tracing, transparency of data gathered is of utmost importance to show beyond doubt that the people privacy is preserved as much as possible. The proposed approach aims at making gathered data publicly available in such a way that anonymity is preserved and stored data are immutable and not owned by a single organization. For this, we equip users in a university environment with an app that reveals their presence as a proximity to a WiFi access point. While the server-side provides location ids to apps, the location history is kept within the app and checks for a possible contact are performed by the app. The server aggregates presence data related to each WiFi access point according to time-slots, and stores these periodically in a blockchain for maximum transparency and immutability. The tests on the developed prototype have shown the accuracy in determining presence data, the feasibility for apps to interact with smart contracts and to have daily presence data stored in a blockchain. The ability to exhibit official and immutable statistics on people gathering at university should be useful to give evidence of the effort to have controlled accesses and gathering avoidance.},

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving fields of encryption and blockchain technologies, the efficiency and security of cryptographic schemes significantly impact performance. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for continuous benchmarking in one of the most popular cryptography Rust libraries, textttfastcrypto. What makes our analysis unique is the realization that automated benchmarking is not just a performance monitor and optimization tool, but it can be used for cryptanalysis and innovation discovery as well. Surprisingly, benchmarks can uncover spectacular security flaws and inconsistencies in various cryptographic implementations and standards, while at the same time they can identify unique opportunities for innovation not previously known to science, such as providing a) hints for novel algorithms, b) indications for mix-and-match library functions that result in world record speeds, and c) evidences of biased or untested real world algorithm comparisons in the literature.Our approach transcends traditional benchmarking methods by identifying inconsistencies in multi-threaded code, which previously resulted in unfair comparisons. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in identifying the fastest algorithms for specific cryptographic operations like signing, while revealing hidden performance characteristics and security flaws. The process of continuous benchmarking allowed textttfastcrypto to break many crypto-operations speed records in the Rust language ecosystem. A notable discovery in our research is the identification of vulnerabilities and unfair speed claims due to missing padding checks in high-performance Base64 encoding libraries. We also uncover insights into algorithmic implementations such as multi-scalar elliptic curve multiplications, which exhibit different performance gains when applied in different schemes and libraries. This was not evident in conventional benchmarking practices. Further, our analysis highlights bottlenecks in cryptographic algorithms where pre-computed tables can be strategically applied, accounting for L1 and L2 CPU cache limitations.Our benchmarking framework also reveals that certain algorithmic implementations incur additional overheads due to serialization processes, necessitating a refined 'apples to apples' comparison approach. We identified unique performance patterns in some schemes, where efficiency scales with input size, aiding blockchain technologies in optimal parameter selection and data compression.Crucially, continuous benchmarking serves as a tool for ongoing audit and security assurance. Variations in performance can signal potential security issues during upgrades, such as cleptography, hardware manipulation or supply chain attacks. This was evidenced by critical private key leakage vulnerabilities we found in one of the most popular EdDSA Rust libraries. By providing a dynamic and thorough benchmarking approach, our framework empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions, enhance security measures, and optimize cryptographic operations in an ever-changing digital landscape.},

However, contemporary online sharing platforms face several challenges related to the establishment of trust among peers, as well difficulties to deal with the growing number of intermediaries (e.g., payment, insurance) needed to ensure an adequate service delivery. We designed and developed "Just Share It" (JSI), an interactive system that enables the sharing of personal physical possessions (e.g., power tools, toys, sports gear) by directly connecting lenders and borrowers, as peers, through mobile technology. The JSI system utilizes a blockchain ledger and smart contracting technologies to improve peer trust and limit the number of required intermediaries, respectively. In this submission, we briefly review emergent challenges in this space, describe the JSI prototype system and its trust model, and reflect on future architectural opportunities for an eventual "in the wild" deployment.},

In this direction, the HELIOS project has been proposed in order to provide a decentralized platform for social applications. Among these several social applications, the Journalism field is considered an important use case. The main problem which needs to be addressed is preventing the spread of fake news and ensuring the authenticity of the literature for end readers. Furthermore, with the rise of Citizen Journalism, the way of how people can participate to share information is changed. In this paper, we present the HELIOS Citizen Journalism App (CJ) developed in the context of the HELIOS project. The CJ App allows users to contribute content anonymously, based on blockchain technology. After publishing the content via the app, the content is available to publishers for further distribution, on a decentralized P2P and IPFS-based network storage. Furthermore, by making a donation for particular content, the CJ also receives remuneration. In this paper, we show the architecture of the App by describing its components and how it works.},

abstract = {In today's digital world, enterprises and individuals are generating massive data that is potentially useful for many data consumers with data driven applications. The emergence of data marketplaces is a step toward helping the data owners to monetize their digital assets and get connected to the potential buyers. The current data marketplaces cannot handle the challenges related to data ownership claims, illegal redistribution, and data ownership traceability. To overcome these problems in a general-purpose market, we propose a marketplace based on watermarking and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) technologies. In the proposed NFT-based marketplace, the owner's data is stored as an NFT where the underlying content of the NFT holds the watermarked data. The watermarked data is obtained by embedding some information about the owners and the buyers into the original data. The embedded information can later be extracted to identify the owner and the buyer of the traded data. Furthermore, the transactions corresponding to the NFT provide verifiable ownership proof and traceable ownership history. A Proof-Of-Concept (POC) implementation of the proposed marketplace that will be integrated within AI-Gallery Data Marketplace service in Huawei Cloud is presented for trading image data. An extensive set of experiments to measure the gas consumption on the blockchain and evaluate the robustness of the watermarked assets against 51 attacks are performed. Finally, a method based on error correction codes is proposed for improving the watermarking robustness in the implemented marketplace. The link for the codes and the POC demo is provided in the appendix.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are software programs implemented on a blockchain platform that monitor and automate the execution of contracts to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of a contract. As such, smart contracts represent a new kind of software that poses its own engineering challenges and requires novel software engineering techniques. In particular, smart contracts require thorough testing before they are deployed because they can't be changed after deployment. This paper proposes a novel approach for executing unit tests for smart contracts intended to reduce test execution time. This reduction is achieved through the reuse of the deployment execution of the smart contract in each test and also the reuse of the setup execution of each test. We implemented the framework SolUnit that uses this approach to execute tests written in Java for Ethereum Solidity smart contracts. We also evaluated the framework SolUnit in five projects. The results show that our approach achieves a meaningful reduction of the time to execute the tests, without breaking the principle of independent tests. The experiments were performed in two environments: an in-memory simulated blockchain and a private Ethereum-based blockchain. Overall, our approach was able to reduce the test execution time by up to 70\%.},

abstract = {Decentralized cryptocurrencies feature the use of blockchain to transfer values among peers on networks without central agency. Smart contracts are programs running on top of the blockchain consensus protocol to enable people make agreements while minimizing trusts. Millions of smart contracts have been deployed in various decentralized applications. The security vulnerabilities within those smart contracts pose significant threats to their applications. Indeed, many critical security vulnerabilities within smart contracts on Ethereum platform have caused huge financial losses to their users. In this work, we present ContractFuzzer, a novel fuzzer to test Ethereum smart contracts for security vulnerabilities. ContractFuzzer generates fuzzing inputs based on the ABI specifications of smart contracts, defines test oracles to detect security vulnerabilities, instruments the EVM to log smart contracts runtime behaviors, and analyzes these logs to report security vulnerabilities. Our fuzzing of 6991 smart contracts has flagged more than 459 vulnerabilities with high precision. In particular, our fuzzing tool successfully detects the vulnerability of the DAO contract that leads to USD 60 million loss and the vulnerabilities of Parity Wallet that have led to the loss of USD 30 million and the freezing of USD 150 million worth of Ether.},

abstract = {Can or should a robot ever engage in a financial transaction with a human? If so, how? How about an enforceable agreement? Blockchain technology has enabled the development of cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, and unlocked a plethora of other disruptive technologies. But, beyond its use case in cryptocurrencies, and in network coordination, blockchain technology may have serious sociotechnical implications in the future co-existence of robots and humans. Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, and our extensive work on open-source blockchain technology and its integration into robotics - this paper addresses these questions and provides insights into how blockchains and other decentralized technologies can impact our interactions with robots and enable the social integration of robots into human society.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Web3 has created a new frontier for digital art and collectibles and an emerging space for fraudulent activities. This study provides an in-depth analysis of NFT rug pulls, the fraudulent schemes that steal investors’ funds. From a curated dataset of 760 rug pulls across 10 NFT marketplaces, we examine these schemes’ structural and behavioral properties, identify the characteristics and motivations of rug pullers, and classify NFT projects into 20 groups based on creators’ association with their accounts. Our findings reveal that repeated rug pulls account for a significant proportion of the rise in NFT-related cryptocurrency crimes, with one NFT creator attempting 37 rug pulls within 3 months. Additionally, we identify the largest group of creators influencing the majority of rug pulls and demonstrate the connection between rug pullers of different NFT projects using the same wallets to store and move money. Our study contributes to understanding NFT market risks and provides insights for designing preventative strategies to mitigate future losses.},
