abstract = {Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) is an emerging research topic in Web3 and blockchain. By combining blockchain, IoT and tokenomics, DePINs are expected to disrupt existing IoT business models and enable Web3 communities to build innovative, machine-driven and decentralized IoT networks and applications. Due to the characteristics of DePINs such as the large number of smart devices and network scale as well as the interactions with blockchain, scalability remains to be one of the key challenges. In this position paper, we outline the core ideas and components for building a rollup-centric scalable architecture for DePINs. The proposed architecture takes a modular design approach and leverages off-chain computing and zero-knowledge proofs to address the scalability challenge. This work is expected to highlight the importance of this new research direction and shed some light on potential solutions.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

abstract = {The music industry faces numerous challenges regarding tracking and distributing royalties. This article explores how a decentralized and transparent system for managing music royalties can be created with a smart contract implementation on the Polygon network, utilizing Chainlink oracles. By enhancing the efficiency and transparency of royalty distribution, this groundbreaking smart contract has the potential to revolutionize the music industry and stand as a blueprint for diverse sectors grappling with analogous challenges in intellectual property rights and revenue allocation. At its core, this smart contract, functioning on the bedrock of blockchain, ensures meticulous oversight of financial transactions between consumers and content creators. It streamlines the process and facilitates the collection of user view statistics crucial for strategic fund allocation. With the potential impact of transaction fees on the user experience of blockchain payments, a new solution has been developed that includes a payment channel that reserves significant amounts of funds and enables off-chain payments through specialized messages. By combining these technological advancements, we are taking a transformative step towards a more seamless and fair future in the complex world of royalty management. The application is structured into conventional backend and frontend segments, with the code available on Github.},

abstract = {We study the competition between blockchains in a multi-chain environment, where a dominant EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) co-exists with an alternative EVM-compatible (e.g., Avalanche) and an EVM-incompatible (e.g., Algorand) blockchain. While EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum users and developers to migrate more easily over to the alternative layer-1, EVM incompatibility might allow the firms to build more loyal and "sticky'' user base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such, the choice to be EVM-compatible is not merely a technological decision, but also an important strategic decision. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and find that at equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain. To avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice can take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network effects. We find that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract users through direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract users through offering better features/products.},
