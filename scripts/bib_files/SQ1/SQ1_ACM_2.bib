abstract = {Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.},

Detecting counterfeit products is a challenge, given what these products could represent as a danger to health and the economy. Several studies have been made in the literature and tried to propose solutions. However, several limitations remain. In this context, this paper presents our framework, ChainDrugTrac, for the traceability and detection of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. After studying existing work and identifying the limits, our contributions could be resumed around 1) proposing architecture for drug traceability based on the blockchain and 2) developing a blockchain-based prototype supporting the proposed architecture. The prototype has been implemented to evaluate our proposal and show its effectiveness.},

Due to the complexity introduced by application-blockchain interaction, existing testing methods become non-applicable. In this paper, we present a guided and automated framework called Sungari to test DApps. The insights behind Sungari are two-fold. First, we employ random events to infer an abstract relation between frontend and blockchain. Second, we use the relation to generate event sequnces in a guided manner that can cover blockchain smart contracts as quick as possible. In a real-world DApp case study, Sungari outperformed random approach by covering 33\% more application use cases.},

abstract = {Evidence is a tangible demonstrative artifact that proves a fact and shapes the investigation of various misconduct cases involving for instance corruption, misbehavior, or violation. It is imperative to maintain proper evidence management to guarantee the admissibility of an evidence in a court of law. Chain of custody forms the forensic link of evidence sequence of control, transfer, and analysis to preserve evidence's integrity and to prevent its contamination. Blockchain, a distributed tamper-resistant ledger can be leveraged to offer a decentralized secure digital evidence system. In this paper, we propose a secure chain of custody framework by utilizing the blockchain technology to store evidence metadata while the evidence is stored in a reliable storage medium. The framework is built on top of a private Ethereum blockchain to document every transmission from the moment the evidence is seized, thus ensuring that evidence can only be accessed or possessed by authorized parties. The framework is integrated with the digital evidence system where evidence is physically stored and locked using smart locks. To secure the sequence of evidence submission and retrieval, only an authorized party can possess the key to unlock the evidence. Our proposed framework offers a secure solution that maintains evidence integrity and admissibility among multiple stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies, lawyers, and forensic professionals. The research findings shed light on hidden opportunities for the efficient usage of blockchain in other realms beyond finance and cryptocurrencies.},

abstract = {With the explosion of COVID-19 cases and the government’s needs to control virus spreading, the development of effective and robust systems for managing vaccination certificates to restrict citizens’ activities has been in the centre of many governments. This paper proposes a system that allows for the update of the status of certificates and bases its function on a specific form of logs stored on Blockchains and a set of rules for the interpretation of these logs. Also an outline of a proof of concept implementation of the system in Ethereum together with a cost and security analysis are provided in the paper. The proposed architecture provides several benefits with the most prominent one being the suspension of certificates in case an already vaccinated individual is found positive. In existing certificate management systems a vaccinated individual that is tested positive still holds a valid vaccination certificate during the self-isolation period. This vulnerability allows infected individuals to commute freely and thus facilitates the spread of the pandemic. The proposed solution is not limited to COVID-19 related certificates, but rather it could be deployed in any kind of digital certificate.},

However, data owners are reluctant to share their sensitive data to third parties for modelling in many cases. Therefore, Federated Learning (FL) has arisen as an alternative to enable collaborative training of models without sharing raw data, by distributing modelling tasks to multiple data owners. Based on FL, we premodel sent a novel and decentralized approach to training encrypted models with privacy-preserved data on Blockchain. In our approach, Blockchain is adopted as the machine learning environment where different actors (i.e., the model provider, the data provider) collaborate on the training task. During the training process, an encryption algorithm is used to protect the privacy of data and the trained model. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is practical in real-world applications.},

There are several ways to make donations or payments, such as bank transfers and credit cards. However, it is not known exactly whether the investment was in fact for the proper purpose. In this scenario, blockchain stands out with cryptocurrency applications and smart contracts, adding credibility to the transactions carried out even if in a decentralized manner, and providing traceability. The objective of this work is to propose a solution to the problem of traceability of money invested by financiers, in addition to an analysis of financial costs and transaction times, helping investors to understand where the funds raised go. To meet the objective, an architecture was designed and the Ethereum blockchain was used in the experiments, concluding that it is necessary to evaluate the cost benefit of the solution and the size of the data to be stored in the blockchain, as well as the variations in the ether values at the time of conversion to the local currency.},

The waste management process is very poor, especially when it comes to confirming the correct destination for the delivery of waste. In this work, we are proposing a chain-based approach to waste tracking to enable waste data reporting in a single system. The blockchain is a technology that has already proven itself in the financial sector. It securely records transactions in a large, time-stamped ledger using the proof of work algorithm (PoW), and allows us to write smart contracts on the ethereum network. The application of this technology to the waste sector will enable reliable, transparent and secure recording of all waste movements, thus enabling waste to be traced from source to treatment and disposal. Users will be able to import and export data through a user interface offering different levels of functionality and access. It will also identify and act on illegal wasteful crimes.},

abstract = {The study and preservation of ancient texts presents unique challenges due to the degradation and damage these manuscripts often exhibit. Papyrology, specifically, relies on meticulous study and reconstruction of fragmented texts by experts. Current digital platforms for editing and publishing papyrological texts lack the ability to manage the complex components of critical editions while facilitating peer review. In our work we propose a novel framework utilizing blockchain and smart contracts to automate the storage and retrieval of multiple related editions of a text while ensuring contributions by multiple authors are recorded. The system architecture consists of a user interface for submitting editions, a smart contract that manages storage, the blockchain ledger which stores data locations, and the use of the decentralized storage platform, the Interplanetary Files System (IPFS). Experiments demonstrated the feasibility of the framework by storing 501 synthetic editions on IPFS and recording metrics for encoding, transmission time, blockchain transaction time, and transaction costs. We believe this novel framework could enable the advancement of digital papyrology through distributed peer review and allow for the integration of AI agents into papyrology. Future development of the proposed platform could significantly modernize digital edition management for papyrology and the humanities in general.},

abstract = {Throughout this paper, we try to describe with blockchain technology the decentralization of the internet. A decentralized network that encourages the internet to operate from the smartphone or tablet of anybody instead of centralized servers. A decentralized implementation would be based on a peer-to-peer network that is dependent on a user community. Their machines connected to the internet will host the network, not a community of more powerful servers. Each site would be distributed across thousands of nodes on various devices. The data is therefore not contained, owned by private storage facilities. There is therefore no central point to hack, and no way for an oligarchy of entities to take control of it. A proposed alternative was formed based on a systematic literature review that demonstrates that Internet decentralization is what this modern technology needs in order to address not only the weaknesses of current servers including server down issue, hacking and data manipulation or single point of failure, but also to prevent companies from monetizing the data of citizens through their server and to market them to the advertisers.},

abstract = {A blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) refers to an application typically using web pages or mobile applications as the front-end and smart contracts as the back-end. The front-end of the DApp helps users generate transactions and send them to the user's blockchain wallet. After the user signs and confirms the transaction using the blockchain wallet, the transaction will invoke the smart contract of the DApp. However, users bear the following risks when using DApps because of the potential inconsistent behaviors in DApps. First, the DApp front-end may generate incorrect transactions inconsistent with users' intentions. Second, the smart contract may have misbehaviors when executing the transactions. Inconsistent behaviors of DApps not only lead to user confusion but also cause significant financial losses. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to identify inconsistent behaviors of DApps on EVM-compatible blockchains by contrasting the behaviors of DApps that derived from the front-end, blockchain wallet, and smart contracts, respectively. We implemented our approach into a prototype named DAppHunter. We have applied DAppHunter on 92 real-world DApps of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain and successfully identified 37 DApps with inconsistent behaviors. We confirmed that 35 of them are scam DApps and over 5 million blockchain addresses are at risk of becoming victims of these inconsistent DApps.},

abstract = {Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability issue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of the chain of blocks (and of the transactions within each block). However, total order is often not fully necessary, since important advanced applications of smart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much higher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order (instead of a total order) can be exploited. In this article, we propose a novel distributed concurrent data type, Setchain, which significantly improves scalability. A Setchain implements a grow-only set whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional blockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest elements added, agreed by consensus. Therefore, two operations in the same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are ordered by their respective epoch number. We present different Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness, and report on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results show that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers, since it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total order. Since the Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying blockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many decentralized solutions with much faster operations than direct implementations on top of blockchains. Finally, we also present an algorithm that encompasses into a single process the combined behavior of the Byzantine servers, which simplifies correctness proofs by encoding the general attacker in a concrete implementation.},

However, the current performance of blockchain is poor, which becomes a major constraint of its applications. Additionally, different blockchain systems lack standard performance monitoring approach which can automatically adapt to different systems and provide detailed and real-time performance information. To solve this problem, we propose overall performance metrics and detailed performance metrics for the users to know the exact performance in different stages of the blockchain. Then we propose a performance monitoring framework with a log-based method. It has advantages of lower overhead, more details, and better scalability than the previous performance monitoring approaches. Finally we implement the framework to monitor four well-known blockchain systems, using a set of 1,000 open-source smart contracts. The experimental results show that our framework can make detailed and real-time performance monitoring of blockchain systems. We also provide some suggestions for the future development of blockchain systems.},

abstract = {Since the emergence of bitcoin, 14 years ago, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins these virtual currencies have experienced a rapid growth, with a plethora of applications emerging. While most popular applications of blockchain technology are in the business field, its main features – such as decentralization or enhanced security – make it suitable to redesign social, cultural and political realities such as the social contract that regulates the relationship between states and citizens. Blockchain-based applications have the potential to change social values and the social contract itself. This paper aims to discover if smart contracts and blockchain technology can bind the social contract between the state and its citizens in such a way as to reduce corruption and increase efficiency of service delivery. Further, the emergence of a new type of social contract will be investigated: the smart social contract. This new concept aspires to enhance Jean Jacques Rousseau's social contract with the benefits inherent in blockchain technology. It involves an automatic execution of the obligations that a government assumes through a certain program, determined by consensus by all the members of society. In case of non-fulfillment of the obligations, the persons /institutions responsible are sanctioned appropriate penalties. We implement and evaluate a prototype of a smart social contract in Solidity, finding that the contract is capable of automatic execution upon the achievement of predetermined conditions, such as the fulfillment of an obligation by a local government official.},

By serving as consolidation platforms, ERP systems offer significant benefits in data visibility and back-office functions and enhance decision-making processes in modern business. Blockchain technology is driving Industry 4.0, and its integration with current ERP systems seems almost mandatory for the years to come. Based on a systematic survey of the current literature, we classify the benefits of blockchain and ERP systems integration, particularly in terms of improved operational efficiency, workflow automation, security and regulatory compliance. In addition, we discuss various challenges for integrating blockchain with ERP systems, such as possible infrastructure upgrades, organizational and cultural aspects, standardization, regulatory issues and high adoption and maintenance costs. We believe that the main results of this study could be of significant value to both researchers and practitioners and could serve as a starting point for better portraying the interrelationships between ERP systems and blockchain technology.},

abstract = {Blockchain and smart contracts are one of the key technologies promoting Web 3.0. However, due to security considerations and consistency requirements, smart contracts currently only support simple and deterministic programs, which significantly hinders their deployment in intelligent Web 3.0 applications. To enhance smart contracts intelligence on the blockchain, we propose SMART, a plug-in smart contract framework that supports efficient AI model inference while being compatible with existing blockchains. To handle the high complexity of model inference, we propose an on-chain and off-chain joint execution model, which separates the SMART contract into two parts: the deterministic code still runs inside an on-chain virtual machine, while the complex model inference is offloaded to off-chain compute nodes. To solve the non-determinism brought by model inference, we leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to endorse the integrity and correctness of the off-chain execution. We also design distributed attestation and secret key provisioning schemes to further enhance the system security and model privacy. We implement a SMART prototype and evaluate it on a popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchain. Theoretical analysis and prototype evaluation show that SMART not only achieves the security goals of correctness, liveness, and model privacy, but also has approximately 5 orders of magnitude faster inference efficiency than existing on-chain solutions.},

However, to accomplish this, one big problem that emerged and outscored everything else was catering to the day to day necessary items of the people without human involvement. In this regard, we propose a blockchain-enabled secure communication framework for delivering the goods in COVID-19 like scenarios by leveraging the drones that are available with commercial retail providers. The blockchain scheme is used to create smart contracts to build the trust of buyers and sellers on the framework as the payments are made through the smart contract executions. The blockchain based order processing ensures the integrity and authenticity of the information. Moreover, a communication model is presented along with the order, delivery and payment phases. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by evaluating it based on gas price, transaction time, and mining time.},

However, storing and sharing data in IoT applications face many challenges in ensuring data integrity and security. Because IoT data collection devices in a centralized model are frequently limited in their security capabilities and are vulnerable to attacks, blockchain technology is rapidly developing many key features to improve data security and sharing. This study aims to employ blockchain technology to enhance the security and data integrity of IoT applications. The system used a private blockchain network built on the GoQuorum platform. The Solidity programming language was used to develop the smart contracts in the blockchain network. Users interact with the smart contract via a web interface to create processes for collecting data from gateways in the sensor network. This blockchain-based system enhances the security of stored data queries and ensures the integrity of the shared data.},

abstract = {A key challenge in engineering distributed systems consists in the integration into their development of a decentralised infrastructure allowing the system participants to trust each other. In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.},

abstract = {The growing popularity of online social media (OSM) has led to the creation of a wide amount of social media platforms. In this context, the increasing competition among platforms and the emergence of decentralized alternatives such as Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSM), have led to more frequent user migrations: individuals tend to switch platforms in search of improved features, content, or communities. Therefore there has been increasing interest in user migration studies modeling and predicting user migration. However, user migration, especially in blockchain-based platforms remains an understudied problem. Existing methods rely on user activity to derive interaction graphs and then address the user migration prediction problem as a node classification task, where user decisions are encoded as node labels. While the performance look promising, there are currently two important research gaps: i) there is no work using graph neural networks, the state-of-the-art in machine learning on graphs; and ii) there is a lack of methods designed to improve prediction performance in the case of class imbalance, i.e. the presence of dominant behavior among the ones to predict. In this paper, we propose a machine learning pipeline utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict user migration in BOSM. We model the data as a directed temporal multilayer graph, capturing social and monetary interactions among users. To address the problem of class imbalance in node classification, we introduce a data-level balancing technique following an undersampling approach. The evaluation, conducted on data describing user migration across blockchain online social media platforms, shows that graph neural networks are a suitable machine learning approach to perform user migration prediction. Furthermore, the proposed undersampling approach improves predictive power on severely imbalanced data. These results highlight how graph neural networks are effective in predicting user migration, without the need for manual feature engineering and in the absence of user information. Our methodology holds potential for applications beyond user migration, such as fraud detection and bot detection, and opens up venues for further research in other prediction tasks in online social networks and blockchain-based systems.},

abstract = {Recent blockchain-based systems for managing credentials show advantages over paper-based procedures. However, issuing credentials with blockchain could conflict with current management rules and policies. One of the possible conflicts is the auditability. Most blockchain-based systems for credentials focus on security, efficiency and privacy while ignoring the auditability of the system. In this paper, we propose a new system IU-TransCert for issuing, verifying, and auditing academic credentials. The system uses a new data structure named the Auditable Merkle Tree that enables credential issuance and built-in auditing capabilities. The auditable data fields can be customized to meet regulations. Credentials are published to the blockchain in the root node of the Auditable Merkle Tree, allowing access for auditors while preserving privacy. The system provides automated and transparent auditing processes for educational authorities to independently verify credentials without involving issuers. We also present a prototype to demonstrate feasibility, and a security analysis to examine protections against threats. The analysis and discussion shows that the proposed system could enhance credential privacy, efficiency, integrity, and auditability across the university ecosystem.},

Higher education is a system with many challenges that could be solved by adopting this technology. Protecting data transactions that involve student degrees is one of the challenges considered by educational institutions. Thus, this paper presents a reference architecture proposal based on blockchain technology and a proof of concept to register and consult student certificates issued by higher education institutions. With this architecture, we intend to evaluate a new business model in this technology applied to the educational domain. As a proof of concept, we presented a prototype implementation using smart contracts based on the Ethereum platform and an evaluation made by experts in high education.},

However, there are still difficulties in the efficiency of blockchain infrastructure implementation. On the other hand, existing solutions present proposals for specific contexts and strict business rules.

Furthermore, this solution allows the configuration of parameters in creating customizable document templates and selecting blockchains.

However, the existing blockchain Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) approaches for secondary students are inadequate. In this study, we designed a tailored workshop for secondary students and examined the effectiveness of introducing blockchain concepts in the context of metaverse by implementation. The workshop integrated four educational theories, including Transfer of Learning, Interest Theory, Situated Learning, and Experiential Learning. The synthesis of typical theories gives rise to an innovative education strategy aimed at facilitating a transfer of awareness and interest from the metaverse domain to the blockchain domain, which is also the workshop’s ultimate goal. The workshop was designed considering the developmental status of secondary school students and its alignment with the Hong Kong secondary curriculum framework to accomplish the learning objective of enhancing their knowledge, skill, awareness and interest in blockchain technology. 225 secondary students joined the workshop, and the findings demonstrated that our approach is effective and the adoption of the transfer from the metaverse domain to the blockchain domain is feasible. The results of this paper may serve as a successful example of blockchain education for secondary students.},

abstract = {Blockchain databases are storage systems that combine properties of blockchains and databases like decentralization, tamperproofness, low query latency and support for complex queries. Blockchain databases are an emerging and important class of blockchain technology that is critical to the development of non-trivial smart contracts, distributed applications and decentralized marketplaces.In this work, we consider the problem of designing end-to-end encrypted blockchain databases to support the development of decentralized applications that need to store and query sensitive data. In particular, we show how to design what we call blockchain encrypted multi-maps (EMM) which can be used to instantiate various kinds of NoSQL blockchain databases like key-value stores or document databases. We propose three blockchain EMM constructions, each of which achieves different tradeoffs between query, add and delete efficiency. All of our constructions are legacy-friendly in the sense that they can be implemented on top of any existing blockchain. This is particularly challenging since blockchains do not support data deletion.We implemented our schemes on the Algorand blockchain and evaluated their concrete efficiency empirically. Our experiments show that they are practical.},

abstract = {Traditional medical prescriptions based on physical paper-based documents are prone to manipulation, errors, and unauthorized reproduction due to their format. Addressing the limitations of the traditional prescription system, e-prescription systems have been introduced in several countries. However, e-prescription systems lead to several concerns like the risk of privacy loss, the problem of double-spending prescriptions, lack of interoperability, and single point of failure, all of which need to be addressed immediately. We propose an AI-assisted blockchain-enabled smart and secure e-prescription management framework to address these issues. Our proposed system overcomes the problems of the centralized e-prescription systems and enables efficient consent management to access prescriptions by incorporating blockchain-based smart contracts. Our work incorporates the Umbral proxy re-encryption scheme in the proposed system, avoiding the need for repeated encryption and decryption of the prescriptions when transferred between different entities in the network. In our work, we employ two different machine learning models(Random Forest classifier and LightGBM classifier) to assist the doctor in prescribing medicines. One is a drug recommendation model, which is aimed at providing drug recommendations considering the medical history of the patients and the general prescription pattern for the particular ailment of the patient. We have fine-tuned the SciBERT model for adverse drug reaction detection. The extensive experimentation and results show that the proposed e-prescription framework is secure, scalable, and interoperable. Further, the proposed machine learning models produce results higher than 95\%.},

abstract = {Ethereum blockchain has shown great potential in providing the next generation of the decentralized platform beyond crypto payments. Recently, it has attracted researchers and industry players to experiment with developing various Web3 applications for the Internet of Things (IoT), Defi, Metaverse, and many more. Although Ethereum provides a secure platform for developing decentralized applications, it is not immune to security risks and has been a victim of numerous cyber attacks. Adversarial attacks are a new cyber threat to systems that have been rising. Adversarial attacks can disrupt and exploit decentralized applications running on the Ethereum platform by creating fake accounts and transactions. Detecting adversarial attacks is challenging because the fake materials (e.g., accounts and transactions) as malicious payloads are similar to benign data. This article proposes a model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for cyber threat hunting in the Ethereum blockchain. Firstly, we employ GAN to generate fake transactions using genuine Ethereum transactions as the first phase of the proposed model. Then in the second phase, we utilize bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to identify adversarial transactions in a hunting exercise. The results of the first phase evaluation show that the GAN can generate transactions identical to the actual Ethereum transactions with an accuracy of 82.51\%. Also, the results of the second phase show 99.98\% accuracy in identifying adversarial transactions.},

abstract = {Medical Records (MR) consisting of Personal Health Record (PHR), Electronic Health Record (EHR), dan Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a medical record that can be accessed and have certain limitations. The challenge in implementing MR is how to be able to collect, store, and analyze patient data in a comprehensive and integrated manner without having to violate patient privacy. The implementation of MR is how to transmit data between hospitals. To solve the problems and issues faced in implementing MR, there is a technology that can overcome this, one of which is using blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that managed by many participants in an availability manner. Ethereum is a blockchain platform that anyone can use to create and deploy decentralized applications that run on the blockchain network. The data stored on the Ethereum blockchain will always be there and can be seen as long as the blockchain network is still online. With ethereum, the process of sharing data will be easy to do using a computer belonging to the hospital as a blockchain node. The result of implementing blockchain into medical record is now the data can be shared securely between hospitals.},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) has made human life simpler through its numerous applications by interconnecting various devices and people together in a heterogeneous network. The number of users associated with IoT in different sectors such as media, intelligent transportation, and healthcare are increasing rapidly, therefore generating a large amount of data each day. Because of this, maintaining quality in the network has become an important aspect for end-to-end data delivery. Software defined networking thus provides flexibility and programmability to the network due to its global approach of network management. To adapt with the dynamic nature of QoS, blockchain technique with its encryption mechanism and distributed consensus algorithm can be deployed on SDN. In this paper, we propose the use of blockchain technology in Software-Defined Internet of Things to deliver high QoS at a low price.},

The immutability of blockchains means that defects in smart contracts cannot be fixed once the code has been deployed. Previous research has focused on identifying defects and developing tools to improve defect detection. However, several existing blockchain defect datasets rely solely on expert knowledge or static code analysis. They do not provide an objective assessment of the real-world impact of defects. We show how blockchain transactions and execution traces can support an objective evaluation of the impact of a smart contract defect. As a foundation for future research, we propose three novel blockchain-specific metrics. Using the defect dataset SmartBugs, we demonstrate the computation of the metrics and the use cases that can benefit from them. This example focuses on five distinct types of the commonly occurring reentrancy vulnerability defect as detected by Slither, Manticore and Osiris.},

abstract = {In recent years, edge-based smart unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) delivery systems have attracted a lot of attention by both academia and industry given its promising business value and also as an ideal testbed for many emerging technologies such as edge computing, blockchain and machine learning. At the moment, one of the critical challenges for smart UAV delivery systems is data privacy since the massive amount of data is being generated by both users and UAVs and the data is used for training machine learning models to support various smart applications such as autonomous navigation, facial recognition, and person re-identification (ReID). To tackle such a challenge, federated learning (FL) has been widely used as a promising solution since it only needs to share and update model parameters with the centralised server without transmitting the raw data. However, conventional FL still faces the issue of the single-point-of-failure. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose BDFL, a Blockchain-enabled decentralised FL framework for edge-based smart UAV delivery systems. In our framework, Blockchain provides a decentralised network for FL to eliminate the need for a centralised server and store private data in the decentralised permissioned Blockchain to avoid the single-point-of-failure. To motivate our study and analyse the privacy concerns, we employ the person ReID application in smart UAV delivery systems as a typical example. In addition, we also provide the customised proof of quality factor (cPoQF) consensus protocol to address the scalability issue of the Blockchain in order to support the increasing number of smart applications in UAV delivery system. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through experiments on energy efficiency, confirmation time and throughput, with further discussion on the impact of the incentive mechanism, and the analysis of its resiliency under various security attacks.},

The operation of Blockchain applications is still based on ad-hoc solutions that are error-prone, difficult to maintain and evolve, and do not manage their interactions with other infrastructures (e.g., a Cloud backend).This paper proposes KATENA, a framework for the deployment and management of Blockchain applications. In particular, it focuses on applications that are compatible with Ethereum, a popular general-purpose Blockchain technology. KATENA provides i) a metamodel for defining Blockchain applications, ii) a set of processes to automate the deployment and management of defined models, and iii) an implementation of the approach based on TOSCA, a standard language for Infrastructure-as-Code, and xOpera, a TOSCA-compatible orchestrator. To evaluate the approach, we applied KATENA to model and deploy three real-world Blockchain applications, and showed that our solution reduces the amount of code required for their operations up to 82.7\%.},

abstract = {At present, using a large number of unsafe IoT devices to form botnets and launching DDoS attacks have become one of the main threats to IoT security. However, most of the existing DDoS attack defense methods are limited to being implemented within a single controller management network domain. In fact, many IoT devices that attackers build botnets are usually located in the jurisdiction of different controllers. Therefore, a mechanism is needed for each domain to cooperate with each other and share information about the attack source, so as to realize the defense against DDoS attacks across multiple domains. Blockchain technology's decentralization and group trusted collaboration mechanism provide a new method for solving cross-domain DDoS attack defense. This article combines SDN and blockchain with IoT, and proposes a cross-domain collaborative DDoS defense scheme based on blockchain and SDN architecture. It allows multiple SDN-based domains to collaborate with each other and share attack source information in a decentralized manner, making collaborative DDoS attack defense across multiple domains more flexible. Experimental results show that the defense mechanism has flexibility, feasibility, and safety.},

It is often challenging to find a suitable donor in case of emergency. The situation is worse if it is a rare blood group. This paper introduces a blockchain-based decentralised application (DApp) to match recipients with blood donors during an emergency. Personal information such as name, location, blood group, and donation history is stored securely in the blockchain distributed ledger through IPFS. The donors' lack of awareness and motivation are the primary reasons for people not coming forward for blood donations. We propose to gamify the blood donation process by issuing NFT badges as a reward for donors. This paper explains the design of smart contracts for storing donor and recipient data on the ledger and issuing NFTs to donors. The article also briefly discusses the process of designing the DApp.},
