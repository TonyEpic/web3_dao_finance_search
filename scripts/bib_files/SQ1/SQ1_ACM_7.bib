abstract = {Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove the correctness of a statement to another party without revealing any information beyond the correctness of the statement itself. It guarantees computation integrity and confidentiality, and is therefore increasingly adopted in industry for a variety of privacy-preserving applications, such as verifiable outsource computing and digital currency. A significant obstacle in using ZKP for online applications is the performance overhead of its proof generation. We develop GZKP, a GPU accelerated zero-knowledge proof system that supports different levels of security requirements and brings significant speedup toward making ZKP truly usable. For polynomial computation over a large finite field, GZKP promotes a cache-friendly memory access pattern while eliminating the costly external shuffle in existing solutions. For multi-scalar multiplication, GZKP adopts a new parallelization strategy, which aggressively combines integer elliptic curve point operations and exploits fine-grained task parallelism with load balancing for sparse integer distribution. GZKP outperforms the state-of-the-art ZKP systems by an order of magnitude, achieving up to 48.1\texttimes{} and 17.6\texttimes{} speedup with standard cryptographic benchmarks and a real-world application workload, respectively.},

abstract = {With the growing enthusiasm for NFT arts, an increasingly large number of users join the community by holding a PFP (profile picture) NFT. In a PFP NFT project, the appearance of the character is a composition of different kinds of properties. Since the rarity of a property is a major contributor to its visual characteristics, characters combining from rare properties are considered as rare NFTs. A PFP NFT is both a digital artwork and an avatar of the user in the virtual environment. Studies on aesthetic and user experience of NFT avatars are yet to be explored. In this paper, we report a study investigating users' aesthetic appreciation of 3D PFP NFTs with different rarities. The research was conducted in the form of an online questionnaire evaluating two PFP NFT projects (CLONE X and HAPE PRIME). We first examine users' perception of visual complexity based on the color and character model of the image. In the second part we evaluated the personality of the avatars using a 10-item short version of the Big Five Inventory. The results of both groups show that rare NFTs tend to have higher model complexity than common ones, while color complexity can be higher or lower. In general, rare avatars are rated higher in openness and lower in agreeableness. Rare properties such as fancy clothing, jewelry, and face masks reflect users' pursuit of power and wealth in real world. Rare NFTs influence the aesthetic experience of users in this emerging context by shaping the aesthetic style of a project while catering to their real-world experiential knowledge and ideal selves.},

abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed for secure and efficient execution within sandboxed environments - predominantly web apps and browsers - to facilitate performance, security, and flexibility of web programming languages. In recent years, Wasm has gained significant attention from the academic research community and industrial development projects to engineer high-performance web applications. Despite the offered benefits, developers encounter a multitude of issues rooted in Wasm (e.g., faults, errors, failures) and are often unaware of their root causes that impact the development of web applications. To this end, we conducted an empirical study that mines and documents practitioners’ knowledge expressed as 385 issues from 12 open-source Wasm projects deployed on GitHub and 354 question-answer posts via Stack Overflow. Overall, we identified 120 types of issues, which were categorized into 19 subcategories and 9 categories to create a taxonomical classification of issues encountered in Wasm-based applications. Furthermore, root cause analysis of the issues helped us identify 278 types of causes, which have been categorized into 29 subcategories and 10 categories as a taxonomy of causes. Our study led to first-of-its-kind taxonomies of the issues faced by developers and their underlying causes in Wasm-based applications. The issue-cause taxonomies - identified from GitHub and SO, offering empirically derived guidelines - can guide researchers and practitioners to design, develop, and refactor Wasm-based applications.},

abstract = {Software supply chain compromises are on the rise. From the effects of XCodeGhost to SolarWinds, hackers have identified that targeting weak points in the supply chain allows them to compromise high-value targets such as U.S. government agencies and corporate targets such as Google and Microsoft. Software signing, a promising mitigation for many of these attacks, has seen limited adoption in open-source and enterprise ecosystems.In this paper, we propose Sigstore, a system to provide widespread software signing capabilities. To do so, we designed the system to provide baseline artifact signing capabilities that minimize the adoption barrier for developers. To this end, Sigstore leverages three distinct mechanisms: First, it uses a protocol similar to ACME to authenticate developers through OIDC, tying signatures to existing and widely-used identities. Second, it enables developers to use ephemeral keys to sign their artifacts, reducing the inconvenience and risk of key management. Finally, Sigstore enables user authentication by means of artifact and identity logs, bringing transparency to software signatures. Sigstore is quickly becoming a critical piece of Internet infrastructure with more than 2.2M signatures over critical software such as Kubernetes and Distroless.},

abstract = {Fair Exchange is a fundamental problem in the exchange of digital items with direct application to electronic commerce. In a fair exchange protocol, two parties want to exchange their corresponding items such that either both receive the other's item, or neither of them receives anything. It has been shown that fair exchange without a trusted third party (TTP) is not possible. Optimistic fair exchange protocols limit the role of TTP to the case that one of the parties misbehaves. OptiSwap (Eckey et al., 2020) is a fair exchange protocol for the exchange of confidential digital items with digital coins. OptiSwap uses a smart contract as the TTP and allows the buyer to use an interactive dispute resolution protocol with the seller (mediated through smart contract) to generate a proof of misbehaviour for a misbehaving seller. We show that OptiSwap's dispute resolution protocol leaks information about the item to the smart contract (public) which can completely reveal the item to the public, and this provides an opportunity for a malicious buyer to pose a credible threat to the fairness guarantee of the system. We propose and design privacy-enhanced OptiSwap that prevents the leakage of information and guarantees security and fairness of the exchange without significantly affecting the efficiency of the protocol. We prove security of the new protocol in an extension of the universal composability for non-monolithic adversaries, and implement and evaluate its efficiency against the original OptiSwap. We discuss our results and suggest directions for future research.},

abstract = {The introduction of the Digital Twin (DT) has sparked a great deal of interest in the virtual replication of physical assets and processes. However, to fully realize the potential of DT, companies require robust and scalable front-end solutions. This study proposes harnessing micro-frontend technologies to surmount the limitations of monolithic front-end frameworks, thereby crafting effective presentation layers tailored for industrial companies. By decomposing complex and distributed systems into modular web-based DT, the proposed framework enables better scalability, synergy, and efficient application development. It also tackles the intricacies introduced by complex multi-vendor elements within DT and the orchestration of services and virtual environments. Research is focused on developing an architecture that facilitates seamless connectivity between multiple blocks of DT as well as interactivity and immersive experiences. Our study offers insights into our journey of implementing this framework for various industrial use cases, such as training, monitoring, and control, highlighting the benefits, drawbacks, and challenges. Ultimately, this research aims to accelerate the creation of DT, improve maintainability, and increase efficiency and productivity in industrial environments.},

abstract = {Sophisticated mass attacks, especially when exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, have the potential to cause destructive damage to organizations and critical infrastructure. To timely detect and contain such attacks, collaboration among the defenders is critical. By correlating real-time detection information (threat indicators) from multiple sources, defenders can detect attacks and take the appropriate measures in time. However, although the technical tools to facilitate collaboration exist, real-world adoption of such collaborative security mechanisms is still underwhelming. This is largely due to a lack of trust and participation incentives for companies and organizations. This paper proposes TRIDEnT, a novel collaborative platform that aims to enable parties to exchange network threat indicators, thus increasing their overall detection capabilities. TRIDEnT allows parties that may be in a competitive relationship, to selectively advertise, sell and acquire threat indicators in the form of (near) real-time peer-to-peer streams. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we instantiate our design in a decentralized manner using Ethereum smart contracts and provide a fully functional prototype.},
