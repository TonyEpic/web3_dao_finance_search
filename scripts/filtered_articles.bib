 abstract = {Blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApp) have been widely adopted in different areas and trusted by more and more users due to the fact that the back end code of a DApp is publicly run on the blockchain and cannot be modified implicitly. However, there are few effective methods and tools for testing DApps and bugs can be easily introduced by inexperienced developers. The existing testing techniques either focus on testing front-end programs or back-end code but ignore the interaction between them, which makes it difficult to apply the techniques directly on DApp. In this paper, we present an automated testing technique for DApps which works in a two-phase manner. First, we employ random events to infer an abstract relation between browser-side events and blockchain-side contracts. Second, our technique generates a set of test cases under the guidance of inferred relations and orders the test cases based on a read-write graph. We also use taint analysis to track data flow of the smart contract and feed it to the generation procedure for following test cases. We have developed a tool called Sungari to implement our approach, and evaluated it on representative real-world DApps. The preliminary evaluation results demonstrated the potential of Sungari in achieving a significant optimization compared to random testing approaches.},

Having a complete view of the past and the ongoing transactions, we can identify and enforce abortion of malicious transactions and prevent losses due to attacks being executed and recorded in the blockchain. Specifically, we modify the Ethereum source code to instrument the entry point of a node to synchronize data received from the Ethereum P2P network and systematically scan suspicious patterns in transactions to identify potential attacks.

However, as a commercial service, the state-of-the-art payment models for cloud gaming are still in their preliminary stages. In this paper, we reveal the shortages of existing cloud gaming pricing models and propose CloudArcade, a token-based cloud gaming system that employs blockchain-empowered cryptocurrency as a payment method for the players using the cloud gaming services. By using cryptocurrency, CloudArcade provides a transparent and resource-aware pricing method, it also enables a time irrelevant silent payment on the floating price to protects users' payment. These features eliminate the quality of experience degradation caused by the spot price in the traditional dynamic pricing model on the QoE-aware service pricing. We also employ the payment channel in CloudArcade to improve the system performance. Discussions on service pricing criteria are put forward, open issues about token issuing and malicious resource speculation are also reviewed. We believe the design of CloudArcade can show a good generality on other QoE-aware and human-centered applications.},

 abstract = {Numerous supply-chain combines with internet of things (IoT) applications have been proposed, and many methods and algorithms enhance the convenience of supply chains. However, new businesses still find it challenging to enter a supply chain, because unauthorised IoT devices of different companies illegally access resources. As security is paramount in a supply chain, IoT management has become very difficult. Public resources allocation and waste management also pose a problem. To solve the above problems, we proposed a new IoT management framework that embraces blockchain technology to help companies to form a supply chain effectively. This framework consists of an access control system, a backup peer mechanism and an internal data isolation and transmission approach. The access control system has a registrar module and an inspection module. The registrar module is mainly responsible for information registration with a registration policy, which has to be followed by all the companies in the supply chain. Besides, it provides a revocation and updating function. The inspection module focuses on judging misbehaviour and monitors the actions of the subjects; when any misoperation occurs, the system will correspondingly penalise violators. So that all related actions and information are verified and stored into blockchain, the IoT access control and safety of IoT admission are enhanced. Furthermore, in a blockchain system, if one single peer in the network breaks down, then the whole system may stop, because consensus cannot be reached. The data of the broken peer may be lost if it does not commit yet. The backup peer mechanism allows the primary peer and the backup peer to connect to an inspecting server for acquiring real-time data. The internal data isolation and transmission modules transmit and stores private data without creating a new subchannel. The proposed method is taken full account of the stability of the network and the fault tolerance to guarantee the robust of the system. To obtain unbiases results, experiments are conducted in two different blockchain environment. The results show our proposed method are promising IoT blockchain system for the supply chain.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals’ quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner’s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.},

An example of such is the commonly used Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, the security concerns with this protocol have presented vital security challenges in most IoT applications. For example, the MQTT protocol does not have secure authentication mechanisms implemented and leaves that task to the developer as all the included native security services are fragile. This paper will present a well-thought approach involving a lightweight authentication and authorization scheme together with a decentralized identity system to manage the users' identities. This mechanism helps in facilitating the authentication for both subscribers and publishers by utilizing a smart contract in Ethereum blockchain to guarantee trust, accountability and preserve user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to prove our work, which involves a decentralized MQTT platform and dashboard using our approach. The usability of this approach was further analyzed, particularly concerning CPU and memory utilization. Our analysis proved that our approach satisfies IoT applications' requirements since it reduces the consumption of resources and that smart contracts help in the automation of data management processes.},

These settings cover almost all voting scenarios that occur in practice. A proof-of-concept implementation for decentralized voting over Ethereum’s blockchain is presented. This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a “preventive” measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a “detective” measure like the use of mirror websites.

Blockchain overcomes this issue with smart contracts. By now, the way to tokenize financial assets into a commodity is known. In this paper, we provide technical details for tokenization. Namely, an artificial dataset from Forex data is constructed for demonstration purposes; two tokenization algorithms are implemented and applied to the dataset; ERC1155-based smart contract is implemented and applied to the algorithms’ output to perform sold-out and secondary market steps.

@article{10.1145/3542949,
 abstract = {Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.},

 abstract = {There has been growing interest in the so-called “Web3” movement. This loosely refers to a mix of decentralized technologies, often underpinned by blockchain technologies. Among these, Web3 social media platforms have begun to emerge. These store all social interaction data (e.g., posts) on a public ledger, removing the need for centralized data ownership and management. But this comes at a cost, which some argue is prohibitively expensive. As an exemplar within this growing ecosytem, we explore memo.cash, a microblogging service built on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. We gather data for 24K users, 317K posts, 2.57M user actions, which have facilitated $6.75M worth of transactions. A particularly unique feature is that users must pay BCH tokens for each interaction (e.g., posting, following). We study how this may impact the social makeup of the platform. We therefore study memo.cash as both a social network and a transaction platform.},

 abstract = {Web3, based on blockchain technology, is the evolving next generation Internet of value. Massive active applications on Web3, e.g. DeFi and NFT, usually rely on blockchain transactions to achieve value transfer as well as complex and diverse custom logic and intentions. Various risky or illegal behaviors such as financial fraud, hacking, money laundering are currently rampant in the blockchain ecosystem, and it is thus important to understand the intent behind the pseudonymous transactions. To reveal the intent of transactions, much effort has been devoted to extracting some particular transaction semantics through specific expert experiences. However, the limitations of existing methods in terms of effectiveness and generalization make it difficult to extract diverse transaction semantics in the rapidly growing and evolving Web3 ecosystem. In this paper, we propose the Motif-based Transaction Semantics representation method (MoTS), which can capture the transaction semantic information in the real-time transaction data workflow. To the best of our knowledge, MoTS is the first general semantic extraction method in Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Experimental results show that MoTS can effectively distinguish different transaction semantics in real-time, and can be used for various downstream tasks, giving new insights to understand the Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Our codes are available at https://github.com/wuzhy1ng/MoTS.},

Until now, scientific efforts have been primarily focused on theoretical discussions about the implications of the technology and on technical proposals to improve and consolidate the underlying infrastructure, neglecting the experience of people using blockchain-based systems. However, for this technology to permeate the mainstream, blockchain technology should be easily accessible to the general public. This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps. Also, we saw how blockchain metaphors and transaction-mediated interactions challenge established mental models for modern applications, imposing heavy workloads on users. We conclude the paper by discussing design implications resulting from blockchain’s paradigm change.},

However, HCI research has so far failed to address them, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is problematic as these new blockchains come with an increasingly diverse set of properties that influence the usability of dApps for end-users. For blockchain interface design guidelines to be valuable for practitioners, they need to acknowledge the heterogeneity of blockchains. However, evaluating novel interface concepts across different blockchains is resource-intensive as each blockchain has to be integrated manually, slowing down research. To address this challenge, we propose a system to support interface experimentation for blockchain applications. The system allows researchers and developers to connect interfaces to a unified API simulating different blockchains and facilitates the configuration, distribution, and evaluation of online experiments.

And we combined with the protection of data by secure network platform in trusted computing and differential-traceability algorithm (DTA).

Finally, through multiple experiments and comparison of the results obtained from security testing, it is verified that the blockchain-trusted computing data privacy protection and data fingerprint traceability SkipList table indexing method can achieve traceability for data privacy protection, transaction security management and peer-to-peer verification of encryption and decryption algorithms.

There can be different kinds of patients staying in hospitals with various diseases. All these medical data records need to be secured appropriately for future use and verification. In the hospital, there will be essential documents such as criminal cases and postmortem reports, although it is unclear if they are being handled properly or not. Even the hospital staff can alter these data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based secured medical data management system to manage access to each medical record in a network of hospitals. The proposed system has three main access management categories: one for securing general (fever or cold) medical report, category 2 for postmortem or crime reports security and category 3 for securing cancer /brain death /genetic disorder reports. Sensitive clinical data should not be visible to patients with cancer or genetic disorders as these patients have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Hence, the data is accessible only to doctors, family members, and researchers. The data related to the crime or postmortem reports have only limited access for those with legal permission to access and verify these types of reports. So through blockchain distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, we could store the data in a tamper-proof manner and manage the user access to these data.},

Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

 abstract = {The development of the Internet has revolutionized the news industry. While bringing various advantages, it has also caused an overflow of fake and malicious news, which has damaged social and economic benefits. In recent years, new news detection schemes are constantly proposed. In the scheme based on artificial detection, blockchain has become an important infrastructure and tool. Because blockchain is open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and traceable, it has important use value in the scenario of artificial detection, which requires the consensus of multiple entities. However, most of the current blockchain-based solutions focus on ex-ante detection, and they do not implement fine-grained detection division. Obviously, one validator cannot detect the authenticity of all types of news, which leads to a reduction in the credibility of the detection results. In this paper, we propose a framework for news full lifecycle management. First, the news is matched with the professional validators through a fine-grained detection control strategy. Then, based on sealed bid auction and secret sharing technology, a Six-stage Submission Protocol is proposed, which places the validator's consensus process off-chain, saving transaction costs and ensuring the credibility of the detection results. We analyzed the cost and performance of the proposed framework, and the results proved its correctness and feasibility.},

 abstract = {Recently, the concept of metaverse has been rapidly emerging, which highly expands the human living space. Specifically, 3D models are at the heart of building a vast metaverse space, so a massive number of 3D models are needed. Existing 3D model libraries and platforms have achieved great results. However, most of them are unscalable, insufficiently open, inefficient to collect, and at risk of service disruption and data corruption. Therefore, we propose and implement Web3DP, a crowdsourcing platform for 3D models based on Web3 (a.k.a. Web 3.0) infrastructure. By using the decentralized blockchain technology, Web3DP has the advantages of transparency, auditability, traceability, data tamper-proof, high file transfer efficiency, and service stability. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed platform. It illustrates that Web3DP shows better file transmission capabilities with an acceptable transaction fee to facilitate 3D model collecting and managing for metaverse, games, cultural heritage, etc.},

 abstract = {Vehicle based logistics are hinged on their ability to timely deliver goods, services, and people. The classical expression of “time is money” comes alive in the logistics industry yielding potentially huge financial and health consequences in case of missing deadlines. This is especially the case for time sensitive pharmaceuticals, delivery of perishable goods, delivery of people travelling, delivery of services in fault fixing/recovery sector. All these use cases motivate the need for an immutable, secure, and immortalized process of tracking time. To solve this challenge, this paper presents prototype-based research that integrates the 4th industrial revolution technologies of vision Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and blockchain. The developed prototype features a Raspberry-PI board embedding a camera, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to recognize plate letters from the image and a crypto wallet to sign the logging of plate number and time events on the NEAR blockchain, an emerging sharded, proof-of-stake, layer-one blockchain that is simple to use, secure and scalable. The effective operation of the developed prototype has been validated inside a campus parking and shows an accuracy of 80\%. The benefits of transparency, security, and immutability of the blockchain combined with the intelligence, data capture, and processing of IoT will enable to develop accountability solutions trusted by all different logistic stakeholders.},

 abstract = {Security and privacy are primary concerns in IoT management. Security breaches in IoT resources, such as smart sensors, can leak sensitive data and compromise the privacy of individuals. Effective IoT management requires a comprehensive approach to prioritize access security and data privacy protection. Digital twins create virtual representations of IoT resources. Blockchain adds decentralization, transparency, and reliability to IoT systems. This research integrates digital twins and blockchain to manage access to IoT data streaming. Digital twins are used to encapsulate data access and view configurations. Access is enabled on digital twins, not on IoT resources directly. Trust structures programmed as smart contracts are the ones that manage access to digital twins. Consequently, IoT resources are not exposed to third parties, and access security breaches can be prevented. Blockchain has been used to validate digital twins and store their configuration. The research presented in this paper enables multitenant access and customization of data streaming views and abstracts the complexity of data access management. This approach provides access and configuration security and data privacy protection.},

 abstract = {Web3 social media strives to eliminate the need for centralized management by building upon on technologies such public ledgers and smart contracts. This has generated significant hype, but creates many notable challenges, many of which remain unaddressed. One such challenge is content moderation. Specifically, the immutable nature of blockchain means that it becomes impossible to retrospectively delete posts. This means that illegal content posts cannot be moderated or removed. In an attempt to overcome this, Web3 platforms, such as memo.cash, allow users to filter out posts from their personal timelines. Taking memo.cash as a use case, the goal of this work is to study the efficacy of the approach, and identify associated challenges. A particularly unique feature of memo.cash is that users must pay money (satoshi) for each social action (e.g., posting and blocking other users). We conjecture that this may impact the nature of moderation, particularly among poorer users. To explore this, we gather data from memo.cash covering 24K&nbsp;users, 317K&nbsp;posts, and 2.57M user actions. We investigate how the need to pay may impact the moderation system and propose potential solutions to address the challenges that arise.},

Nevertheless, it becomes critical for charging station (CS) to handle huge number of EVs further leading to the uncoordinated and inefficient charging. Moreover, none of the authors have considered the possible EV charging scenarios for allocation at the CS. Thus, we have designed an Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized application for EV charging at the CS along with the energy trading between prosumer and consumer EVs. Further, we have formulated charging scenarios based on the energy demand and type of EV (emergency and high authority). We have deployed the smart contract in Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and further built a decentralized application using Web3 to made charging allocation accessible to the EVs. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed smart contract for the application is evaluated in terms of gas consumption and cost analysis with the help of deployed smart contract in the Remix IDE.},

However, since many users list their account identities (IDs) on social networking service (SNS) profile pages and reuse their account IDs for self-branding and curation purposes, which increases the risk of de-anonymization on Web3 services by linking these accounts. If such high-risk SNS accounts hold large amounts of crypto-assets, they are subject to account hijacking and spoofing attacks for financial gain. In this study, we proposed a method to discover highly relevant SNS accounts from a seed account on Web2 and Web3 SNSs and estimate their account ownership. We applied our method to 480 seed accounts of 9 different SNSs and discovered 1,233 new accounts. We found that SNSs with multiple URL input forms on their profile setting pages linked more accounts and revealed that 207 out of 253 (81.8\%) users reused their IDs across different SNSs. We identified 26 accounts linked to personal and crypto-asset information that are at risk of de-anonymization. Our user study using crowdsourcing services showed that as many as 232 (40.8\%) out of 568 respondents do not understand the traceability of blockchain transaction histories. We examined the security and privacy risks caused by account listing and ID reuse, and made recommendations for service providers and users based on our findings.},

Belief is a key component for everyone involved in generating funds, including the donor, the company that provides the fundraising platform's services, and even the fundraiser. However, traditional crowdfunding platforms have some limitations, such as high transaction fees, payment processing delays, and lack of transparency. So, this paper has emerged blockchain technology to address these limitations, offering a new model of crowdfunding that is decentralized, secure, and transparent. The proposed solution is a blockchain-based crowdfunding service platform in the form of a Decentralized Application (DApp), which further utilizes smart contracts and crowdfunding campaigns to execute the crowdfunding process.

Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).

Our proposed distributed VRF scheme employs multi-party computation (MPC) where each participant is identified by their own decentralized identifiers (DID) on a blockchain network, making the collective randomness by preventing any single participant from determining the output of the VRF. We further aim to enhance the randomness of our VRF scheme by utilizing a successor rule-based de Bruijn sequence to generate pseudo-random numbers with a strong balanced property, ensuring both numbers of 1s and 0s are equal. For generic VRF construction, we adapt the approach of selective-secure VRF scheme using verifiable functional encryption (VFE), which is a more generalized version of homomorphic encryption plus verifiability. Moreover, we estimate the security aspects of our VRF scheme and the entropy approximation based on the information-theoretic perfect secrecy model. Also, using the NIST SP800-22 test suite for randomness, we demonstrate the randomness performance with a 98.29\% overall pass rate on the total 176 tests of 11 standard tests and 0.6765 of the average p -value for statistical randomness. We provide technical details on implementing our VRF MPC model in the Solidity smart contract.},

 abstract = {Individual medical records have a high priority of integrity and security, yet they are vulnerable to data breaches and manipulation. It’s vital to communicate these data in a secure and safe manner. To overcome this problem, the proposed solution named, CoreMedi, uses blockchain technology to store and share medical data. Data stored on blockchain is immutable, verifiable and transparent (based on accessibility). As data cannot be altered on blockchain, the rate of fraud may be drastically decreased. With the help of smart contracts which are small pieces of code that run on blockchain, a Decentralized Application (DApps) is designed and implemented that enables patients/individuals to store and share medical records securely. Users may share their medical history, medications, and personal data with a specific medical personnel on the same blockchain network using CoreMedi, a Decentralized Web application. The application is implemented with React as frontend and the backend infrastructure uses Ethereum solidity smart contracts. The process of running a blockchain application is not simple because the users must be willing to spend crytpocurrencies as gas fees, as this is the way to maintain the network with no single organization having control.},

With the use of blockchain technology, which offers us security, availability, and integrity, this study seeks to address these problems. Using this, the records can be safeguarded and accessible from anywhere, at any time. This blockchain-based solution can protect a patient's life in an emergency since all of the records can be viewed in one location without the inconvenience of running various tests.

It is challenging to study and understand such data without compromising user privacy. We propose AFFIRM, a secure privacy-preserving blockchain framework for efficient, scalable and lightweight mobility data generation, validation, storage and retrieval in future Web3 applications. AFFIRM enables nearby devices to self-organize as a fog network and collaboratively train machine learning algorithms locally to securely generate, validate, store and retrieve mobility data via consensus leveraging Information Centric Networking as the underlying architecture. The proposed collaborative learning enables nodes to learn and adapt with respect to parameters related to scalability, timeliness, security, privacy, and resource consumption. We evaluate AFFIRM using mobility data from New York city and results shows it to scalably store mobility data from up to 700 devices with lower delays and overhead.},

 abstract = {The pharmaceutical industry's crucial task is to look after the medicines while they are being transported, by ensuring ideal storage conditions and keeping track of the complete medications sent to prevent risky scenarios. These three classifications are used by WHO: falsified, substandard, and unregistered/unlicensed. The need for sophisticated tools to identify fabricated pharmaceuticals will rise as criminals grow craftier. To identify phoney and substandard drugs, new technologies are continually being developed. A substantial lack of transparency in the current system makes it difficult for patients to understand the cost of acquired medications, making counterfeit drugs a prime issue. Moreover, if there are accusations of illegal or unethical behaviours, it could be difficult to look into supply chain tampering. The blockchain technology was employed. Two parties' transactions can be efficiently and permanently recorded using an open, distributed ledger like blockchain. Blockchains are transparent, decentralized, distributed, and unchangeable, which makes them an ideal solution for the problem of fake medications. This study proposes a mechanism for the safe distribution of medications throughout the whole supply chain. Each product in the chain can be moved between chain associates who have been confirmed using an event request-response approach. A product may be traced back to its source thanks to smart contracts, which are used to record all transactions between entities onto the blockchain. A DApp is made using the React Framework. On a local blockchain that Ganache provided, the smart contracts were put into action. The blockchain connection between the DApp and Web3.js is made possible by the Truffle framework. The outcomes of the studies show that our method is practical and marginally more secure than existing solutions.},

A single server, which performs all significant processing, serves as the hub of a centralized system. Thus, a centralized server becomes an easy target for hackers. Decentralized social networks can provide a more secure environment where users may exercise more privacy control through distribution of information processing across many machines. This study proposes a system where the Web3 Library is used to implement the decentralized network. This provides a social graph with all devices in the network. The Ethers library provides functionalities to engage the Ethereum framework. This way an OSN (Online Social Network) service based on blockchain is created and its decentralized operations are performed. Due to a decentralized autonomous organization that is designed for user autonomy, users can democratically self-manage the OSN.},

Web 1.0 focused on serving static pages is considered as the read-only web, whereas web 2.0 made way for dynamic pages making it as read-write web, which is predominantly experienced. The main problem face here is, as the users of E-commerce applications, is single-point-of-failure (SPOF), which means, the data stored in centralized servers is highly susceptible and vulnerable to attacks. Now, the internet's next evolution enables to develop decentralized applications and adds few other features like trustlessness, distributed, transparent, robust, etc. This also makes web 3.0 as read-write-own web. Now, this evolution wave of decentralization has hit the applications. To overcome this problem, this study has proposed a solution to completely decentralize the E-Commerce platform by using Blockchain in conjunction with smart contracts and utilizes the decentralized storage like IPFS (Inter Planetary File System).

Modern centralised digital marketplaces and enterprises provide consumers with an alternative method of selling and purchasing items conveniently. However, disadvantages among the marketplaces include the platform’s potential to arbitrarily block merchants, the fees associated with listing and selling products on the site, and the lack of user data privacy. In this, we propose and demonstrate a decentralised application that takes advantage of the Ethereum blockchain to address all these issues. The Truffle development framework was employed in the creation of the application. An Ethereum smart contract later migrated to the Ethereum network comprised the application’s features. The web3.js API (Application Program Interface) was used to send the user’s input to the Ethereum network after being received through a web interface. The users involved will be able to do transactions with the help of an interactive user interface. The interfacing is done using the Truffle framework, and the transactions are made through MetaMask, where ETH tokens are used. The dApp is created using JavaScript and React JS library. Thus, the integration of the blockchain and with front-end application by interfacing it with web 3.0 helps create a secured, immutable, trusted, and easy-to-use e-commerce website.},

In particular, we first transform the rNFT backward and onward reference relationship to a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) and model appropriate node and edge features from rNFT metadata and associated token transactions. Next, a multi-layer GraphSage model is designed to include the collected features for the learning process. In this way, the model takes into account graph topology together with features to classify both the existing and incoming NFT nodes in a supervised way. We also give comprehensive elaboration on the architecture of the new GNN-based recommender system with discussions in regard to its characteristics and challenges.

While this is not an issue for most existing enterprise applications, such character is not compatible with the decentralization principle of dApp/Web3 applications, more of which are being deployed in the cloud environment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build a decentralized FaaS, which is managed by multiple cloud service providers and allows a decentralized application to take advantages of FaaS. In this research paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system for managing decentralized FaaS using blockchain technology and decentralized API management, where functions are executed on a distributed network of nodes by multi-cloud data centers, rather than on a centralized server.

 abstract = {Decentralization promises to remedy the drawbacks of the web by executing decentralized applications (DApps) on blockchains. Unfortunately, modern blockchains cannot support realistic web application workloads mainly due to congestion.We introduce the Smart Redbelly Blockchain (SRBB), a provably correct permissionless blockchain that reduces congestion by (1) avoiding redundant propagation and validations of transactions with Transaction Validation and Propagation Reduction (TVPR) and (2) mitigating the propagation of invalid transactions within blocks by Byzantine nodes with a dedicated Reward-Penalty Mechanism (RPM). Our comparison of SRBB against Algorand, Avalanche, Diem, Ethereum, Quorum, and Solana, using the DIABLO benchmark suite, indicates that SRBB outperforms all these blockchains under real application workloads. Moreover, SRBB is the only blockchain to successfully execute real workloads of NASDAQ and Uber on a DApp without losing transactions. To demonstrate that TVPR and RPM are the causes of the improved performance, we compare SRBB with its naive baseline, which does not contain TVPR and RPM. Our results show that TVPR increases the throughput by 55× and divides the latency by 3.5, while RPM increases the throughput by 7% under flooding attacks. Finally, TVPR helps reduce transaction losses in the normal scenario while RPM goes further and mitigates transaction losses under flooding attacks.},

 abstract = {Blockchain is a specific Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that is an emerging technology currently disrupting various fields. The aim of this paper is to explore ways to harness the advantages of blockchain while being implemented to existing systems. A permissioned blockchain can be established through Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) that utilizes ledgers that are interacted upon by a chaincode. An HLF network was established to investigate the custom chaincode. The scenario of the project was grounded on the functions performed in a web-based property inventory management system that uses a centralized database. The chaincode in the project was written using JavaScript and Node.js was used to create the whole chaincode source. A channel was built between the nodes of the blockchain where the chaincode was deployed. Subsequently, to open a gateway to the network, multiple Representational State Transfer (RST) Application Programming Interface (API) were created. Several gateway endpoints were tested through Insomnia, a cross-platform API client for RST. The tests performed employed various request methods (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) which resulted in evidence that the custom chaincode is fully functional and adheres to the OpenAPI specification. The paper concludes that it is highly feasible and advantageous to integrate a blockchain into an existing Web 2.0 system. Most functions and business logic in existing traditional systems can be reflected in a chaincode with proper planning and execution. In the future, other aspects of the blockchain network will be explored further.},

To support the development of Web3, privacy-preserving decentralized data computing schemes need to be studied. In earlier works, blockchain was used for trusted data sharing. However, due to the lack of computing attribute, blockchain is not capable enough to ensure the trustworthiness of the distributed computing process. Besides, the distributed computing method requires a large amount of data transmission and the current privacy protection researches seldom consider the problem of user privacy. In this article, we design a blockchain-assisted privacy-preserving distributed data computing architecture to break-through the limitations of existing researches. The proposed architecture ensures the secure and trustworthy computing with state channel and computing sandbox. We also design a sandbox location obfuscation method based on onion routing technology, making it difficult for attackers to identify the sandbox location or infer user privacy. Our solution fully considers the characteristics of Web3 and can well support the diverse Web3 applications.},

 abstract = {Online merchandising plays an important role in internet users’ behavior. With the advent of Web3.0 and blockchain technologies, online markets can be adapted to these new changes. In traditional online markets, buying and selling are performed in a centralized manner, which, in addition to the problems of centralized systems, also brings the challenge of users’ trust. One of the challenges in online markets is maintaining the privacy and not revealing the exchanged file to unauthorized entities. Another challenge is to have a mechanism to detect fraud in the market. If the wrong file or key is sent by the seller, the fraud detection mechanism guaranties that the smart contract will be informed and the buyer will be refunded. On the other hand, the seller will be paid if a correct file and its corresponding key have been sent.Blockchain network is not suitable for file storing. Therefore, there are centralized or decentralized methods to store files in building a blockchain based file sharing market. In this work, we selected a distributed file system storage called IPFS (InterPlanetary File system). We integrated IPFS network with a suitable smart contract which is deployed on Ethereum blockchain. We provided a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism to resolve any dispute that happens between market users.},

 abstract = {The use of IoT technology in collecting personal health records (PHR) within the eHealth environment is a growing trend. However, data integrity is a concern as cloud service providers (CSPs) often cannot guarantee it. Blockchain technology offers a solution to guarantee data integrity and traceability. However, the immutability of traditional blockchain conflicts with GDPR's requirements. To address scalability and privacy concerns, we have designed a comprehensive scheme that integrates the redactable blockchain with the existing revocable IPFS mechanism. Our scheme overcomes the disadvantage of residual downloading information in the traditional blockchain. Additionally, we have developed an enhanced proxy re-encryption scheme that simplifies access control for physicians without the need for complex group key management. Unlike traditional blockchains and P2P file sharing systems, our PHR platform allows for selective removal of records and files while maintaining auditable logs. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively enhances the exclusive revocation feature with acceptable overheads. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide the merit of fully complete record and file revocation on a blockchain-based system.},

The PoC demonstrates that NFTs can be used to authenticate items, build trust between parties and establish verifiable product own-ership. By paralleling NFT transfers with the sale of items, the practicality of selling counterfeit goods is reduced. Furthermore, the blockchain-based storage of product information enables verification of origin, history, and authenticity by any involved party, fostering transparency and equal access to information for buyers and sellers. We demonstrate that Web3 technology can effectively address critical issues in traditional reseller markets, offering substantial benefits to all parties involved.},

One of the key Web3 technologies that is intersecting with the metaverse is blockchain technology, that has now imbued metaverse worlds and platform as what are now identified as Layer-1 and Layer-2 metaverse, and in tandem the intersecting of decentralized Web3 technologies including but not limited to metaverse currencies and cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens and tokenization, marketplaces, digital wallets, and blockchain main and side-chain networks. In combination with interoperable and interconnected avatars, the metaverse is evolving beyond phygital experiences and asset architecting into financial experiences and asset trading. This research paper investigates the intersections between the metaverse and Web3 emerging technologies by firstly conducting a systematic literature review of the metaverse and its intersection with emerging technologies which currently has a dearth in academic and research literature despite the developments of the Web3 metaverse and its Layer-1 Layer-2 protocol. The review is followed by pilot-testing the metaverse platforms intersecting with Web3 technologies in real-world, particularly on the use of buy-and-sell, trading and item ownership under decentralized finance and financial technology. Finally, the research assesses the resulting metaverse based on user reviews and experiences on the feasibility of Web3 metaverse. The intersection of Web3 and the metaverse is still an early adoption of IR4.0 emerging technologies, yet the convergence of the metaverse, blockchain technologies and advancements in artificial intelligence is ultimately the precursor to the future Web4.},

Traditional monitoring has been centralized, with healthcare professionals providing face-to-face care to all patients. This is where blockchain is utilized, where users themselves have data and monitor each other. Mutual monitoring of medical information on the blockchain creates a mutually supportive relationship where users themselves monitor each other. In this demonstration experiment, the system was introduced to six elderly people. This decentralized system in which users themselves monitor each other is called the Web3 type. The Web type is a technology that is expected to break through the current concentration of data in overseas digital industries and leave digital data resources in Japan. This research is unique in that it combines blockchain technology, which is at the core of this technology, with medical information. A mutual assistance system was constructed to visualize and mutually monitor their exercise habits using wearable terminals. As a result, the exercise habits of all participants improved, and unique information was obtained from the questionnaire survey.},

 abstract = {The frequency of software supply chain attacks has reached unprecedented levels, primarily due to the increasing reliance on huge numbers of software and hardware dependencies, and the inherent vulnerabilities they harbor. Currently, vendors providing these software and hardware components share security advisories to centralized databases or post them on proprietary websites, which security engineers have to search manually to find vulnerabilities relevant for their systems. Furthermore, the security advisories often do not follow a standard machine-readable format, which results in the engineers having to manually analyze the documents. In this paper, SENTINEL, a novel solution for automating dissemination and discovery of security advisories leveraging Web3 technologies, is presented. In particular, the Ethereum blockchain is used by vendors to notify asset owners of novel vulnerabilities in their systems in a reliable and accountable manner. Evaluation tests conducted on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet confirm that our proposal is a functional and functioning solution for securely disseminating and discovering security advisories utilizing a fully decentralized infrastructure.

 abstract = {In the evolution of technology, the Web 3.0 has become the future of the technological world. The web 3.0, which is still evolving, aims in creating an immersive environment which contains smart applications supported by AI and aims in decentralization of data. In the upcoming era, the successor of today’s transactions is most likely to be the transactions through cryptocurrency, which is built on top of the blockchain technology. It is important to make the upcoming technology more reliable, secure, and fast to bring it to real-time use. To overcome the low throughput and high latency of broadcasting in blockchain technology this paper comes up with the pandemic protocol for broadcasting. Communication can be the most important part of any network to work efficiently. It is a communication protocol used for broadcasting which works on the principle of how the pandemic Covid-19 spread. The implementation of this protocol in the blockchain technology to broadcast the transactions can make the technology more efficient and faster. This implementation will be tested for its efficiency and its throughput, analyze its performance, and resolve issues. Overall, this work will help in remove the inadequacies of existing communication protocols thus helping in demonstrating the benefits of this pandemic protocol for communication. The Pandemic Protocol minimizes data redundancy, reducing latency and network congestion, a significant improvement over traditional protocol. In the Web 3.0 era, the Pandemic Protocol’s efficient communication capabilities make it ideal for real-time applications and network scalability. By minimizing redundant data, it bolsters security, reducing the risk of data tampering and strengthening data integrity. Unlike energy-intensive protocols like Proof of Work (PoW), the Pandemic Protocol minimizes resource consumption, making it eco-friendly and cost-effective.},

 abstract = {The advent of Web3 technologies and blockchain has opened new avenues for exploring decentralized solutions to pressing environmental issues. A blockchain-based Web3 application for the management of CO2 absorption rights could be a very effective solution to combat climate change. Blockchain technology allows the creation of permanent and transparent records of transactions in a decentralized network, which makes it an ideal tool for monitoring and managing CO2 absorption rights. The rights could be registered in the blockchain and transferred through smart contracts, which would guarantee the validity and traceability of these transactions. In addition, the Web3 application would allow greater accessibility for users, since it could be accessed from anywhere without the need to have proprietary systems installed. Decentralized applications could also be used to verify CO2 emissions and removals by users, which would increase transparency and trust in the system.

 abstract = {The music industry has experienced significant growth, primarily driven by digital streaming services. However, major platforms have centralized control, limiting artists’ autonomy and revenue. To address this, the emergence of Music NFT marketplaces represents a revolutionary shift. These platforms leverage blockchain to tokenize music, turning it into unique, tradable assets through NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This allows artists to have direct interactions with fans, offer exclusive content, and establish new revenue streams. Music NFTs serve as certificates of ownership, providing proof of authenticity and making forgery challenging. Artists can choose platforms, mint and sell NFTs, and promote drops on preferred social media. Buyers acquire the original audio file and the chance to support artists. NFT owners can store collections in crypto wallets and decide to sell, with artists earning a share of subsequent sales. Music NFTs offer an alternative to streaming, providing fans a direct means to support artists, while artists strengthen connections with supporters and earn royalties from secondary sales.},

 abstract = {Web3.0 apps, with their emphasis on decentralization, real-time processing, and low latency, hold the key to MEC's bright future. This calls for an all-encompassing, future-oriented strategy in MEC architecture and design. The suggested technique is a multi-stage strategy for molding the future of MEC via cutting-edge architectures and designs for Web3.0 over 5G/6G networks. In the first stage, you'll examine the needs and goals of Web3.0 in detail. Real-time, lowlatency interactions are essential, as is familiarity with the dynamics of distributed apps and blockchain technology. In the second stage, we examine the current MEC setup, from edge server dispersion to data center density to network topology. The technique takes use of the low latency, high throughput, and huge device connection offered by 5G and impending 6G networks to guarantee preparedness for the future. The suggested technique is based on novel building layouts as its foundation. Latency, throughput, resource usage, scalability, and security compliance are only few of the metrics that may be evaluated to guarantee that the design is effective. The difficulties of actual deployment are also discussed; they include issues like where to put edge servers and how to scale resources according to demand. To ensure that the process remains in step with developing technologies and user preferences, it is recommended that improvements be made in a series of iterations.},

Decentralized identification, semantic data, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs are just few of the concepts that are examined in depth to provide the groundwork for this technique. The main goal is to figure out what kinds of hardware are needed to implement these theoretical principles. Subsequently, the technique continues to extract the hardware requirements, distinguishing the unique demands, problems, and performance criteria important for enabling Web3.0 and edge intelligence. These needs include a wide range of topics, including performance, safety, efficiency, scalability, and even compatibility. Once the theoretical principles and hardware requirements are fully understood, the technique moves on to the design step. Key to realizing these abstract ideas is the development of specialized hardware architectures and components. Based on the outcomes of the performance assessment, iterative refinement is carried out to fix the hardware's flaws and enhance its functionality. As a result of this iterative process, hardware is kept up to date to suit the ever-shifting requirements of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. The suggested technique concludes with an emphasis on flexibility and future-proofing in light of the everchanging nature of Web3.0 and edge intelligence. Keeping up with technology developments and reevaluating the hardware design as needed are both part of this process.},

Thus, data integrity and transparency are key concerns in e-FIR database. In this paper, e-FIR data integrity and false registration appended with police stations in a centralized database are addressed via a consensus-based distributed blockchain solution, as an integral part of a smart city environment. Specifically, a smart contract based intelligent framework has been utilized to explore the potential of Ethereum blockchain in providing integrity to e-FIR data stored in a police station's database. Local database is interfaced with Ethereum blockchain using Web3 Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol. Multiple simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

However, few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0. Our definition is not the only way of understanding ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0 applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable ${\mathsf Web3.0}$Web3.0, in this article, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: ${\mathsf (i)}$(i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and ${\mathsf (ii)}$(ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of ${\mathsf HyperService}$HyperService in approximately 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability and scalability.},

Conventional centralized IMS lack transparency and are vulnerable to single-point failure. This paper presents a blockchain-aware decentralized identity management and access control (BADIMAC) model that mitigates these barriers. BADIMAC allows users to keep their digital identity within their control (i.e., self-sovereign identity). On the other hand, with the help of BADIMAC, service providers across enterprise boundaries can verify their identity without depending on any central authority. BADIMAC offers transparency and better security. The decentralized consensus-based design of BADIMAC enables the verifier to validate claims and establish proof of digital identity with process effectiveness.},

However, integrating blockchain with the vast amounts of data in the fishing supply chain poses significant challenges. Challenges include managing extensive data such as photos or videos for product traceability throughout their lifecycle, compounded by the growing complexity of cross-border trade and market expansion. Additionally, blockchain's storage capacity limitations present hurdles in fully accommodating and comprehensively storing detailed supply data from a complex and expanding supply chain. While solutions like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) have been explored for large data storage on the blockchain, this paper proposes a directly integrated blockchain solution tailored for the challenges of fishing with big data. We introduce a novel big data design that preserves blockchain's anonymity and immutability features, addressing storage limitations while maintaining the architecture's purpose. Furthermore, our proposal integrates product supply chain traceability with carbon footprint tracking, enabling comprehensive assessment based on quality, sustainability, and carbon footprint criteria. Despite the proposed solution needing to be tested in real-life situations, we conducted rigorous testing through simulation, white-box evaluation, and complexity analysis. The results demonstrate the potential of our solution to address challenges faced in fisheries supply chains, providing valuable insights for future practical implementation and validation efforts.},

There is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that integrates Ethereum blockchain, IPFS, and advanced cryptographic techniques to address these challenges and enhance the security and transparency of transactions. This research paper presents a robust system that harnesses the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS (Interplanetary File System), and advanced cryptographic algorithms to create a secure, decentralized approach for tracking goods and preventing theft incidents. Unique identifiers and related information will be sent to the mail of the customer and same should entered by the customer for successful transaction. By assigning unique identifiers to purchased products and employing cryptographic techniques to encrypt sensitive data, our system ensures both user privacy and the creation of an immutable transaction ledger. Users can efficiently manage their purchased goods, block stolen items, and communicate with sellers through an intuitive interface. Additionally, the system provides sellers with a comprehensive transaction history, enhancing accountability and transparency within the supply chain. Through this research, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our blockchain based anti-theft measures, underpinned by Ethereum, IPFS, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms, in fostering secure, trustless transactions.

These innovations offer creative solutions to address longstanding challenges. However, the novelty of these concepts has given rise to issues related to information asymmetry among investors, exacerbated by the opinions shared on social media platforms. To comprehensively analyse the trends of these technologies and their societal impact, as well as their influence on the contemporary business landscape, we conducted a study in the social platforms X (formerly known as Twitter) analysing 59,453 tweets using natural language processing (NLP). Through this research, we have identified key topics such as investment security or corporate challenges that provide valuable insights and structured information essential for industry stakeholders. In summary, this study explores the dynamic interplay between blockchain technology, ICOs, STOs and social media in the industry. It sheds light on the sentiment and implications of the use of this technology and these emerging financial models, offering a nuanced understanding of their impact on the market.

As observed in recent times, citizens can now apply to open their own commercial file or obtain a passport without having to visit the country's economic institution or the Immigration and Passports headquarters. Additionally, applying or opening accounts in virtual banks also added a lot of services and facilities for users and transactions between countries that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal effort [2]. All these transactions require the user's authentication and identity verification to avoid any personal fraud and save the user's rights Blockchain technology stands out as one of the most secure technologies available enabling secure transactions without the need for a central authority. Starting in 2009 1, with Bitcoin leveraging blockchain technology, there has been an increasing number of blockchain technology-based solutions. The significance of this work compared to its predecessors is that it uses an existing product and technology to prove the solutions offered by Blockchain and find a solution for authorization and authentication.},

In contrast, Hyperconnected Diasporas (HD) are data-driven networks engaged in extractive activities, often employed for government (para)diplomacy, heavily relying on social media extractivist data-opolies or Big Tech platforms. This article examines the impact of disruptive technologies on e-diasporas in the context of data extractivism, particularly stemming from HD. The article pursues a dual objective: (i) reviewing existing literature and comparing five disruptive technologies—Blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Data Cooperatives, Metaverse, and ChatGPT—in sustaining e-diasporas as networks driven by human agency, and (ii) scrutinizing associated opportunities and risks, including challenges to institutional trust and data privacy arising from HD. The study seeks to elucidate how these technologies may either hinder or exacerbate the impacts of HD on e-diasporas, characterized by their human-driven nature. The article begins with an introduction to HD, followed by a literature review on e-diasporas. Methodologically, it presents a comparative analysis of the five disruptive technologies concerning the research question and discusses their implications for e-diasporic communities, concluding with final remarks.},

 abstract = {The popularity of blockchain technology has bootstrapped many “Web3” applications, e.g., Ethereum and IPFS, that apply distributed ledger technology to store transactions. The amount of transactions generated and stored in such Web3 applications is significant and, in its raw form, usually not searchable by users. Existing Web3 transaction indexing and search engines are predominantly centralized and, therefore, can manipulate search results or censor particular queries. With the proliferation of Web3 transactions and applications, a decentralized and censorship-resistant search primitive is becoming essential. We present DeScan, a decentralized and censorship-resistant indexing and search engine for Web3. Users index their local Web3 transactions using custom rules that output triplets. Generated triplets are bundled in a distributed transaction graph that is searchable by other users. To coordinate search and distribute the storage of the transaction graph over peers in the network, we build upon a Skip Graph (SG) data structure. Since the Skip Graph does not provide any resilience against adversarial peers that censor searches, we propose four modifications to improve its robustness. We implement DeScan and conduct experiments with up to 12 800 peers and 10 million Ethereum transactions. Our experiments show that DeScan with our modifications enabled can tolerate 20% adversarial peers and 35% unresponsive peers without disruption. Moreover, we find that searches in DeScan are usually completed well within a second, even when the network grows. Finally, we show that storage and network costs are evenly distributed amongst peers as the network grows.},

 abstract = {In the context of extreme societal polarization, activists have mobilized to protest injustices and claim their rights, yet such efforts often fall short of goals because demands normally are directed to government or firms that offer superficial responses. Communitarianism, which broadly strives for autonomy from established institutions, promises the development of self-provisioning communities based on cooperative networks and participatory, democratic governance that prioritizes use over exchange value and redistribution over profitable activity for individuals. The emergence of Web3 and blockchain technology has ushered in new affordances such as scaling a communitarian enterprise and exchange of value independent of banks or other institutions. Whereas market-based organizations use Web 3 affordances for accounting purposes for profit, communitarian organizations aim to link accounting with designs to inject capital into a commons to support self-governing communities in community-based peer production (CBPP). To exemplify the broad range of approaches to the multifaceted goals of CBPP, I focus on FairCoop and Sensorica. Despite considerable differences, these organizations nonetheless share problems and generally are illustrative of longstanding challenges to communitarian enterprises – digitalized and non-digitalized alike. Perennial problems such as the fraught capitalist/postcapitalist relation, self-interest, uneven power relations, lack of diversity, and the challenge of responding adequately to societal needs combine with effects of automated governance and associated effects of technocracy that can dissolve founding values to threaten the integrity of a communitarian collective. CBPP as well as its non-digitalized counterparts are important contributions to humanity, but goals and actual practices can diverge. CBPP requires vigilant designs that complement rather than replace human decision making with algorithmic governance and pay attention to reflexivity and positionality, continual re-design to engage unanticipated problems, and distancing actually existing projects from discourses that reify patterns such as decentralization with the consequence of missing crucial contextual knowledges.},

Thus, in contrast to earlier iterations of the web, Web3 users are asked to trust the technology itself rather than the human intermediaries. On its face, this shift to a trustless web calls into question the traditional conceptions of and requirements for trust. However, in this article, we caution against claims that advocate distrusting Web3 on the basis that, despite how quickly Web3 technology is advancing, the psychological processes through which people perceive and make sense of the social world remain fundamentally unchanged. Drawing on the psychology of trust and the evolution of web technologies and associated objects of trust, we argue that Web3 is not so trustless after all. We also highlight opportunities for brands to build trust in Web3 technology, including key considerations in leveraging opportunities and directions for further research. Overall, this article provides critical guidance to brand managers, policy advisors, and academics seeking to understand, build, and trust Web3 technology.},

Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms. To effectively leverage decentralized trust as a novel aspect of competitive actions, business leaders must pursue Web3 technologies that are reliable, high-growth market segments that are credible, and ventures that are investable.},

 abstract = {Abstract:
Anticipatory action (AA) refers to a series of interventions executed when a hazard presents imminent danger, as indicated by forecasts, early warnings, or pre-disaster risk analyses. It involves proactive measures undertaken by individuals or organizations before an expected disaster to lessen its impact on people, assets, and infrastructure likely to be affected. An increasing array of inter-governmental bodies, governments, United Nations entities, global non-governmental organizations, and Red Cross and Red Crescent movements, have been delving into and utilizing anticipatory action. It has been heralded globally by governments, donors and organizations alike as being a more protective, practical, and cost-effective method of disaster risk management. However, ongoing pilots by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and partners have exposed a significant level of friction between the capacity and speed of existing systems and stakeholders to execute these processes in a manner that is synchronized and timely enough to have the intended impact. This research investigates the potential of blockchain technology to streamline AA programs. It analyzes existing academic and non-academic sources (scholarly and gray literature) to develop a framework for identifying which blockchain applications can be most beneficial. By viewing smart contracts, data oracles, and decentralized finance (DeFi) as a toolbox, the framework examines how these technologies can be used to digitize and simplify AA processes. For AA practitioners, this approach offers a practical solution to potentially increase efficiency and speed within existing program structures. Additionally, it may have the secondary benefit of simplifying cash transfer delivery. Ultimately, this piece seeks to be more thought-provoking than prescriptive; as both areas of work (AA and blockchain technology) are continuously evolving, hopefully new cross-sectoral collaborations can ensue and provide more granular insights on what AA and blockchain synergies look like in practice.},

Web3 describes a broad range of emerging internet applications for blockchain technology (i.e., a decentralized, public database that allows information to be securely recorded on a network of computers rather than verified and controlled by centralized entities). Central to this evolution of the internet are four distinct blockchain-enabled applications: fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies), nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and metaverses. In this article, we define each of these applications and discuss their capacity to increase peer-to-peer interactions, decrease large companies’ control of information and services, and facilitate access to user networks at a much lower cost than currently possible. These distinctions make Web3 both a natural evolution of Web 2.0 and a broader paradigm shift that may fundamentally alter the online interface, organizational structure, and business practices.

 abstract = {This article introduces the next major generational evolution of the web: Web3. We review the fundamental evolution of the internet and the web over the past 3 decades, including a brief presentation of the publications in Business Horizons that are important in a discussion of the emergence of Web3. We then discuss what these recent developments mean to organizations, consumers, and the public. Though the degree to which Web3 will be widely adopted is uncertain, these technologies are already creating both exhilarating and terrifying implications for e-commerce, digital media, online social networking, online marketplaces, search engines, supply chain management, and finance, among others. We propose the consideration and management of technical, organizational, and regulatory interoperability for Web3 to deliver on its promises of value and that failure to consider these interoperability components may destroy economic value, consumer confidence, or social issues online. We also call on our fellow researchers to focus on these interoperability issues and how they might impact the positive and negative sides of Web3 technologies to help us understand and shape our Web3 future.},

To enhance trading efficiency and pricing fairness, as the major challenges of P2P market designs, this study introduces two new market mechanisms, Hybrid Auction Coalition (HAC), and innovative coalition business model (ICBM), respectively. The performance of these market mechanisms is contrasted with existing mechanisms from the literature with respect to electricity bills, market efficiency, fairness, and blockchain feasibility using a comprehensive list of indicators including costs and profits, fairness, market efficiency, and technical viability. Compared to traditional billing, ICBM and HAC increase sellers’ profit by 88% and 66% respectively, while both impose 13% more costs on buyers. ICBM and HAC also set the fairest prices compared to the existing markets. ICBM is shown to improve blockchain feasibility and market efficiency due to lighter on-chain calculations, and absolute clearing mechanisms. The results also demonstrate that HAC outperforms standalone auctions in every aspect which endorses the hybridization benefits.},

 abstract = {In modern paradigm of smart grid, prosumers can trade energy peer-to-peer in a transactive energy market to reduce energy costs and improve energy efficiency. In addition, cloud energy storage (CES) is a type of shared energy storage systems with high economic efficiency that can provide energy storage services for prosumers and become an active player in energy trading. However, transactive energy implementation in power systems has several challenges such as data privacy and security. In existing researches, energy trading mechanisms rely on central authorities, where security and privacy cannot be maintained. Therefore, this paper presents a decentralized stochastic optimization model of transactive energy management based on blockchain in the presence of CES. In this framework, the smart contract based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers technique is deployed on the Ganache and Ethereum blockchains, and the YALMIP toolbox along with CPLEX solver handle decentralized optimization in the MATLAB software. The numerical results demonstrate that not only the capacity of distributed generations is fully utilized, but also total costs of smart homes are reduced by more than 27%, and the total grid’s delivery power to smart homes is decreased by more than 24% compared to the inflexible scheduling.},

 abstract = {In recent years, on the one hand, we have witnessed the rise of blockchain technology, which has led to better transparency, traceability, and therefore, trustworthy exchange of digital assets among different actors. On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.},

 abstract = {Digital globalization enabled by disruptive technologies has opened a myriad of ways to create value, warranting a cross-disciplinary research agenda on digital connectivity in international business (IB). Given the scarcity of understanding about the role of specific technologies enabling value creation through digital connectivity, we investigate how blockchain-based digital connectivity shapes value creation in international digital platforms and ecosystems (DPEs). Building on a comparative empirical analysis of international DPEs enabled by different types of blockchain technology, we develop a typology of blockchain-based connectivity in IB. The typology demonstrates how different blockchain technology types enable different kinds of connectivity, resulting in diverse approaches to value creation within newly emerging forms of DPEs. These findings contextualize the concept of digital connectivity, enabling more precise explanations of blockchain's adoption in DPEs, and expand the conceptualization of DPEs, with three new types emerging from the utilization of blockchain-based connectivity. Moreover, this interdisciplinary explanation reveals why certain features theoretically attributed to blockchain (e.g., decentralization, trust) do not always realize or support value creation in practice in IB based on the DPE business model.},

However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet. The experimental results show that our scheme can more securely solve the problem of excessive privacy leakage of medical users within a feasible timeframe.},

 abstract = {Web3 is emerging as the new Internet-interaction model that facilitates direct collaboration between strangers without a need for prior trust between network participants and without central authorities. However, one of its shortcomings is the lack of a defense mechanism against the ability of a single user to generate a surplus of identities, known as the Sybil attack. Web3 has a Sybil attack problem because it uses peer sampling to establish connections between users. We evaluate the promising but under-explored direction of Sybil avoidance using network latency measurements, according to which two identities with equal latencies are suspected to be operated from the same node, and thus are likely Sybils. Network latency measurements have two desirable properties: they are only malleable by attackers by adding latency, and they do not require any trust between network participants. Our basic SybilSys mechanism avoids Sybil attackers using only network latency measurements if attackers do not actively exploit their malleability. We present an enhanced version of SybilSys that protects against targeted attacks using a variant of the flow correlation attack, which we name TrafficJamTrigger. We show how the message flows of Round-Trip Time measurements can be used to expose attack patterns and we propose and evaluate six classifiers to recognize these patterns. Our experiments show, through both emulation and real-world deployment, that enhanced SybilSys can serve a fundamental role for Web3, effectively establishing connections to real users even in the face of networks consisting of 99% Sybils.},

We develop a conceptual model and testable propositions that extend the work of McKnight et al. (2001, 2002, 2011) to the blockchain ecosystem based on an integrative literature review. We conceptualize trust as a multidimensional, multi-object construct combining three major objects of trust: algorithmic trust in the blockchain protocol (platform), trust towards peers and services providers, and trust in decentralized applications (product). The model reflects the process of building a trust layer for users and institutions on top of the trustless technology. The paper demystifies the trust building process, from initial trust to knowledge-based trust, and its dimensions within the blockchain ecosystem, and, consequently, helps practitioners to build strategies that increase users' trust. The contribution to the academic literature resides in the unification of multiple perspectives on trust within an integrative conceptual framework to point out the mechanisms of trust building process, as well as to identify future research directions.},

 abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.},

However, DFL faces incentive and security challenges in the decentralized framework. To address these issues, this paper presents a Hierarchical Blockchain-enabled DFL (HBDFL) system, which provides a generic solution framework for the DFL-related applications. The proposed system consists of four major components, including a model contribution-based reward mechanism, a Proof of Elapsed Time and Accuracy (PoETA) consensus algorithm, a Distributed Reputation-based Verification Mechanism (DRTM) and an Accuracy-Dependent Throughput Management (ADTM) mechanism. The model contribution-based rewarding mechanism incentivizes network nodes to train models with their local datasets, while the PoETA consensus algorithm optimizes the tradeoff between the shared model accuracy and system throughput. The DRTM improves the system efficiency in consensus, and the ADTM mechanism guarantees that the throughput performance remains within a predefined range while improving the shared model accuracy. The performance of the proposed HBDFL system is evaluated by numerical simulations, which show that the system improves the accuracy of the shared model while maintaining high throughput and ensuring security.},

The proposed system combines IoT and blockchain technology. IoT sensors placed on nuclear waste drums allow to generate information regarding their status in real time. Blockchain provides an immutable repository for the drum monitoring information decentralized across a set of stakeholders, like nuclear waste originators, waste packaging and transportation companies, storage sites, and regulatory bodies. Following the principles of design science research, we describe a prototype implementation of the proposed system based on a private instance of Ethereum and its application in a pseudo-real use case in Korea. The proposed system is the first of its kind evaluated by practitioners and aims to set a reference for future implementations in this field.},

 abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an emerging data-driven paradigm that leverages the collective intelligence of the crowd, their mobility, and the crowd-companioned smart mobile devices embedded with powerful sensors to acquire information from the physical environment for crowd intelligence extraction and human-centric service delivery. However, existing MCS systems operate in a centralized manner, giving rise to several challenges, including privacy, security, incentives, and dependence on a central service provider. Blockchain is a novel application paradigm that incorporates point-to-point transmission, consensus mechanisms, cryptography, intelligent contracts, distributed data storage, and other computing technologies, creating a shift from the current centralized paradigm to a decentralized paradigm. Nonetheless, the convergence of MCS and blockchains necessitates addressing numerous fundamental challenges arising from their merger. This paper examines the major issues facing MCS systems and blockchain’s potential role in addressing them. We present the MCS-blockchain integrated deployment strategies, architectural designs, and core blockchain technology principles that contribute significantly to the performance of blockchain-based MCS applications. Additionally, the advancement of blockchain technology and its impact on MCS system security and performance requirements are investigated. Finally, we highlight current research gaps and future research opportunities that may inspire the deployment of novel blockchain-based MCS systems.},

 abstract = {The emergence of Web3 technologies in the recent decade offers innovative tools and protocols that can revolutionize market research, which faces the ongoing challenges of comprehending consumer needs. One possibility is to securely store and represent personalized consumer preferences. This manuscript illustrates the application of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as a means to present consumer preference data and deliver personalized product recommendations directly to consumers. To do this, we initiated a study involving a small group of 31 respondents who participated in the “What’s Your Whisky” survey. Their responses were transformed into unique pieces of artwork generated by an algorithm. Furthermore, whisky recommendations were derived from these survey responses and integrated into the corresponding artwork. These personalized artworks, which represent each respondent’s whisky taste preference and top whisky selection, can be minted onto a blockchain as NFTs. This process enables respondents to securely own and retain them in their digital wallets, thus creating an immutable record of their whisky taste preferences and personalized recommendations. Finally, a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the value of personalized artwork NFTs. Respondents were asked for preferences between artwork derived from their taste preferences to those with the same whisky recommendations but with randomly sourced background art. Binomial test results revealed a clear preference for artwork based on their personal affirmed that respondents favored artwork based on their personal survey responses.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has demonstrated promising potential for covert communication. Although a series of studies have investigated blockchain-based covert communication, systematic research on the information-hiding patterns and covert communication patterns built on the blockchain is absent. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the related patterns. Based on intensive investigation, we abstract and propose a reference model for blockchain-based covert communication. We accordingly identify five types of covert communication patterns, each with different roles for covert senders and covert receivers, which enable one-to-one and one-to-many communication. Using Bitcoin as an example, we analyze the data distribution of covert channels within the block and transaction structure. Furthermore, we compare the hiding patterns and covert communication patterns and discuss the challenges and promising directions to achieve secure, robust, and cost-effective covert communication using blockchain. This work can provide valuable insights into the potential of blockchain technology for covert communication and lay the foundation for future research in this area.},
