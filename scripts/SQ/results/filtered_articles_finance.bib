 abstract = {Blockchain is being widely adopted far beyond finance into numerous domains of society and promises unprecedented potential to disrupt organizations, businesses, industries, and economies. However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

 abstract = {Blockchain has been a latest trend and many of its applications show promising results in terms of transactions, validations, finances etc. and recently it has become an apple of eye for the tech industry and investors. The concept of decentralized application (commonly known as dApp) and the blockchain platform itself can help to reform many unresolved solutions for the betterment of services and generate new opportunities for the developers to focus on creating applications in a decentralized environment with ease. The adaptation of blockchain technology through dApps is increasing drastically; thus opportunity for the developers and entrepreneurs are growing rapidly. Considering the impactful revolution of dApps, the developer communities are getting more interest to the dApps development tools, frameworks and platforms. This paper is presenting a comprehensive study on some popular blockchain powered decentralized or distributed dApp platforms. In this paper we made analysis of these platforms based on different factors and parameters. This analysis provides an impactful direction to the developer and enterprise community in adopting of the development platform.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a new paradigm to build decentralized systems which do not require a central authority. It is most popular for enabling Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. However, blockchain applications span beyond Finance, and recently it has been applied to decentralized governance. Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer. We will illustrate its potential with the case of the DAO Genesis Alpha, which is the main DAO of the DAOstack project.},

 abstract = {We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks — and, thereby, DeFi protocols — would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.},

The Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA) is widely used in blockchains, e.g., Libra/Diem; however, no suitable threshold solution exists. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a threshold EdDSA that allows n parties to generate keys in a decentralized and distributed manner. Any t + 1-of-n parties can generate standard EdDSA signatures. This scheme supports an arbitrary threshold (t, n) and has been proven to be secure against at most t malicious adversaries. The theoretical analysis (computation complexity and communication footprints) and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs efficiently on cloud servers and embedded devices. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is integrated with Tendermint, a blockchain framework that uses EdDSA, to generate keys and sign transactions in a decentralized manner, which indicates that this scheme is compatible with blockchains for supporting DeFi applications.},

Two years ago the total value locked in DeFi systems was approximately 700m USD, now, as of April 2022, it stands at around 150bn USD. The frenetic evolution of the ecosystem has created challenges in understanding the basic principles of these systems and their security risks. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) we delineate the DeFi ecosystem along the following axes: its primitives, its operational protocol types and its security. We provide a distinction between technical security, which has a healthy literature, and economic security, which is largely unexplored, connecting the latter with new models and thereby synthesizing insights from computer science, economics and finance. Finally, we outline the open research challenges in the ecosystem across these security types.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

Governance tokens are distributed to users of the platform, granting them voting rights in the platform's governance protocol.Many DeFi platforms have already been subject to attacks resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in user funds.  In this paper we show that governance tokens are often not used as intended and may be harmful to the security of DeFi platforms. We show that (1) users often do not use governance tokens to vote, (2) that voting rates are negatively correlated to gas prices, (3) voting is very centralized.  We explore vulnerabilities in the design of DeFi platform's governance protocols and analyze different governance attacks, focusing on the transferable nature of voting rights via governance tokens. Following the movement and holdings of governance tokens, we show they are often used to perform a single action and then sold off. We present evidence of DeFi platforms using other platforms' governance protocols to promote their own agenda at the expense of the host platform.},

 abstract = {Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain's role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain's potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain's role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain.},

 abstract = {Eighteen percent of the world’s population do not have access to electricity, impeding economic, social, and human development. The electricity access challenge can be attributed to the significant investment gap needed to finance new power projects, requiring new and innovative financing options. Independent Power Projects, funded, built, owned, and operated by the private sector and constituted via a special purpose vehicle—a legal entity whose sole purpose is implementing a power project—have become one of the fastest-growing sources of investment in the electricity sector. The limitations of traditional finance sources, including high credit, liquidity, margining, third-party, legal, and process risks, means that funds for these projects are expensive and raised only after a long and arduous process. The present article addresses these challenges by describing a novel decentralized autonomous organization, a blockchain-agnostic special purpose vehicle underpinned by a trio of autonomous mechanisms—mobilization, collateralization, and settlement. These mechanisms enable seamless finance mobilization for the special purpose vehicle from a location-independent crowd, revenue collection from the electricity buyer in a risk-mitigated manner, and disbursal of eventual project revenues to investors.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

The emergence of other technologies derived from blockchain, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and the Metaverse, has fundamentally transformed people’s daily lives and profoundly impacted future versions of digital businesses. This study explored the evolution of digital businesses in the near future, with a specific focus on the two primary technologies mentioned above. First, we reviewed DeFi-based technologies, including GameFi, SciFi, SocialFi, and others which serve as foundational building blocks for future jobs and businesses. Second, we examined Metaverse-based jobs, such as Metaverse-based academies and markets which are expected to be launched as commonly used businesses. Ultimately, this study provides several guidelines, such as how to use DeFi 2.0 and apply centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi)-based platforms. Additionally, it offers future directions for launching these businesses, including controlling the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in practical applications, utilizing cloud-assisted models for the Metaverse, and providing conditional privacy for future Metaverse-based businesses.},

 abstract = {This systematic literature review summarizes the extant research in the Behavioral Finance (BeFi) and digital asset spaces to understand better the interactions of behavioral effects on the pricing of assets constructed, enabled, and exchanged in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) markets. We find that asset pricing in these rapidly evolving markets is better explained through BeFi than through traditional finance (TradFi) theory. Investor attention, sentiment, heuristics and biases, and network effects interact to form a highly volatile and dynamic market. We offer a deterministic research framework with propositions for future research. We further provide investors with a theoretically and empirically supported structure to better inform their decisions through an understanding of BeFi applications to DeFi.},

 abstract = {Decentralized finance (DeFi), which executes financial transactions using blockchain without an intermediary, has attracted over US$250 billion in total value locked (TVL) at its peak. However, little is known about how DeFi protocols assure users of the safety of their investments. This paper provides the first empirical evidence on DeFi audit services that check and verify the smart contracts underlying these protocols. Using data on 316 of the largest protocols, we find that those vetted by more smart contract auditors and by higher quality auditors have higher TVL and that these protocols have higher market capitalization (native token values). Using an event study approach, we document that TVL and token values significantly increase after a protocol's first audit, especially those involving a high-quality auditor. We also find that protocols with more auditors and higher audit quality exhibit a smaller drop in TVL and token values after the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which reduced aggregate DeFi TVL by almost 65%. Overall, our findings suggest that DeFi users and investors perceive audits as providing assurance regarding the safety of their deposits and investments.},

@article{CHUNG2023122258,
 abstract = {The capital required to maintain infrastructure in good repair falls short globally. This is commonly referred to as the “infrastructure finance gap”. To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-to-end example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented.},

 abstract = {The influence of blockchain on technology, especially in the field of finance, has brought about the age of cryptocurrencies and decentralized control, spreading its impact across various industries to ensure precision. As the trend moves towards decentralized social networks, diverse approaches are explored, becoming crucial tools for defining trust and privacy in individuals’ personal lives during uncertain environments. Blockchain’s transformative role reaches beyond finance, revolutionizing how we establish trust and privacy in our interconnected digital societies. Concurrently, researchers recognize the efficacy of trust models in enhancing the security and reliability of social networks applications. However, a comprehensive review of recent advancements in trust models based on blockchain for social networks is lacking. To address this gap, our survey takes a comprehensive perspective on the theme of trust within decentralized networks. We examine various concepts such as the trust concept itself, trust models, trust prediction methodologies, decentralization in trust-based social networks, and the role of blockchain in fortifying trust and security in social networks. We investigate the intersection of trust and blockchain technology, encompassing concepts, types of blockchain, and their applications in social networks. These models are categorized based on different parameters, and we examine both their advantages and limitations. Finally, we propose prospective paths for researchers interested in exploring this area.},

In so doing, we have identified some evidence that returns are impacted by tweets, but not by social indicators that appear to be more relevant for volatility. We have further confirmed that the S&P500 Index negatively influences cryptocurrency returns, which means that these two asset classes are substitutes. Uncertainty and attention indices are relevant in determining returns and the alternative measurement of volatility. However, they remain insignificant for illiquidity and our initial volatility choice.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (‘DeFi’) has gained tremendous momentum over the past three years by using novel approaches to disintermediating financial institutions in the provision of financial services. However, empirical research in this field is still rare, and a more comprehensive understanding of the domain is a missing component in academic research. This paper develops a taxonomy based on a comprehensive literature analysis to systematically structure this emerging field. The taxonomy includes three perspectives (strategy, organization, technology) and seven dimensions (blockchain, value proposition, token type, business process, price mechanism, protocol type, integration type) as well as thirty-six characteristics. The application of the taxonomy to 278 DeFi start-ups reveals that most of the DeFi start-ups focus on Ethereum (36.3%) and have a focus on analytics and automation (52%), while, surprisingly only a few incorporate decentralized governance approaches (3.3%), provide decentralized exchanges (14%) or integrate off-chain data.},

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.},
