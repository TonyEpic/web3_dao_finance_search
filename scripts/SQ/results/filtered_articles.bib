 abstract = {Media production and consumption behaviors are changing in response to new technologies and demands, giving birth to a new generation of social applications. Among them, crowd journalism represents a novel way of constructing democratic and trustworthy news relying on ordinary citizens arriving at breaking news locations and capturing relevant videos using their smartphones. The ARTICONF project [1] proposes a trustworthy, resilient, and globally sustainable toolset for developing decentralized applications (DApps). Leveraging the ARTICONF tools, we introduce a new DApp for crowd journalism called MOGPlay. MOGPlay collects and manages audio-visual content generated by citizens and provides a secure blockchain platform that rewards all stakeholders involved in professional news production. Besides live streaming, MOGPlay offers a marketplace for audio-visual content trading among citizens and free journalists with an internal token ecosystem. We discuss the functionality and implementation of the MOGPlay DApp and illustrate three pilot crowd journalism live scenarios that validate the prototype.},

 abstract = {Workload surges are a serious hindrance to performance of even high-throughput key-value data stores, such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and more recently Aerospike. In this paper, we present a decentralized admission controller for high-throughput key-value data stores. The proposed controller dynamically regulates the release time of incoming requests explicitly taking into account different Quality of Service (QoS) classes. In particular, an instance of such controller is assigned to each client for its autonomous admission control specific to the client's QoS requirements. These controllers operate in a decentralized manner with only local performance metrics, response time and queue waiting time. Despite the use of such "minimal" run-time state information, our decentralized admission controller is capable of coping with workload surges respecting QoS requirements. The performance evaluation is carried out by comparing the proposed admission controller with the default scheduling policy of Aerospike, in a testbed cluster under various workload intensity rates. Experimental results confirm that the proposed controller improves QoS satisfaction in terms of end-to-end response time by nearly 12 times, on average, compared with that of Aerospike's, in high-rate workload. Results also show decreases of the average and standard deviation of latency up to 31\% and 50\%, respectively, during workload surges (peak load) in high-rate workload.},

 abstract = {Gossip algorithms can provide online information about the availability and the state of the resources in supercomputers. These algorithms require minimal computing and storage capabilities at each node and when properly tuned, they are not expected to overload the nodes or the network that connects these nodes. These properties make gossip interesting for future exascale systems. This paper examines the overhead of a decentralized gossip algorithm on the performance of parallel MPI applications running on up to 8192 nodes of an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer. The applications that were used in the experiments include PTRANS and MPI-FFT from the HPCC benchmark suite as well as the coupled weather and cloud simulation model COSMO-SPECS+FD4. In most cases, no gossip overhead was observed when the gossip messages were sent at intervals of 256ms or more. As expected, the overhead that is observed at higher rates is sensitive to the communication pattern of the application and the amount of gossip information being circulated.},

 abstract = {Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) offer a formal model for planning in cooperative multiagent systems where agents operate with noisy sensors and actuators, as well as local information. Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and model based—limitations that we address by distributed reinforcement learning (RL). We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL. However, alternate learning requires an initial policy. We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach. We empirically demonstrate that the refined approach produces near-optimal solutions in many challenging benchmark settings, staking a claim to being an efficient (and realistic) approximate solver in its own right. Furthermore, alternate best response learning seeded with such policies quickly learns high-quality policies as well.},

 abstract = {In a decentralized storage system, agents replicate each other’s data to increase availability. Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners’ availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents’ availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents’ matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running.We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an “adoption” mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents.},

This scenario poses new challenges to software engineers that have to design and implement such complex systems. We want to address this problem, designing and developing an infrastructure, GRU, that uses self-adaptive decentralized techniques to manage large-scale distributed systems. GRU will help developers to focus on the functional part of their application instead of the needed self-adaptive infrastructure. We aim to evaluate our project with concrete case studies, providing evidence on the validity of our approach, and with the feedback provided by developers that will test our system. We believe this approach can contribute to fill the gap between the theoretical study of self-adaptive systems and their application in a production context.},

 abstract = {Recent blockchain-technology related innovations enable the governance of collaborating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to engage in agile business-network collaborations that are based on the novel concept of smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely coupled collaboration lifecycle with the main steps of setup, enactment, possible rollbacks and finally, an orderly termination. This lifecycle supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs, smart contract negotiations, and behavior monitoring during enactment with the potential for breach management. Based on a sound understanding of the collaboration lifecycle in a Governance- as-a-Service (GaaS)-platform, a new type of conflict management must safeguard business-semantics induced consistency rules. This conflict management involves breach detection with recovery aspects. To fill the detected gap, we employ a formal design-notation that comprises the definition of structural and behavioral properties for exploring conflict-related exception- and compensation management during a decentralized collaboration. With the formal approach, we generate a highly dependable DAO-GaaS conflict model that does not collapse under left-behind clutter such as orphaned processes and exponentially growing database entries that require an unacceptable periodic GaaS reset.},

 abstract = {Recent advancements in technologies and protocols mean that it is easier than ever to integrate social features into diverse web applications, and increased awareness of privacy concerns means that it is pertinent to consider empowerment of application users when doing so. Many developers are already familiar with the notion of personal data stores; this tutorial will demonstrate how to access or provide such stores for users, and build simple web applications which read and write to the storage whilst remaining completely decoupled from it. This advantages developers in two ways: by removing the burden of storing and maintaining a canonical copy of user data; and by enabling access to and ease of integration with data created through other applications, creating richer, seamless experiences. From the application users' perspective, they need no longer commit and become bound to particular services, but can mix, match and move between those that best meet their needs.We will introduce Solid, a set of protocols based on existing W3C recommendations, for reading, writing and access control of the contents of a personal data store, which can be layered up in order to integrate various social features into new or existing web applications. Attendees will leave with an understanding of Solid and how different parts of the protocols can work together, and having written some code to implement the parts that interest them most. They will also have hands on experience with existing libraries and tooling to facilitate working with the Solid protocols. Those who stay for the full day will have an opportunity to build a small but complete web application with decentralized social features, and to collaborate with others to see the advantages of sharing data between multiple applications.},

A smart tv acts as a display for a smart phone on demand without installing specific software. However, the variety of collaborations among smart devices is limited. Given a smart home environment, a smart door bell equipped with a camera should easily integrate and utilize its newly provided functionality in collaboration with existing devices like using a smart tv as display. Further it should be able to adapt to environmental changes, e.g., when the user changes the room another device should take over the displaying part. Composing distributed adaptive software systems at run time is a challenging topic in decentralized infrastructures like Smart Cities or Internets of Things. Such infrastructures consist of a large set of independent autonomous subsystems from different providers, but only a few subsystems might be involved in a composition. Centralized self-adaptive approaches maintain a global view on the system which is infeasible for large infrastructures. Decentralized approaches are limited in terms of heterogeneity and lack incorporation of new functionality.},

This approach offers a number of advantages including avoiding a single (centralized) point of failure, and associated (centralized) performance bottlenecks. However, such services are often assumed to be openly available with little or no security. This is increasingly not the case. Instead organizations and the services they offer require autonomous ways of defining and enforcing their own access control policies supporting fine-grained authorization. Tackling such scenarios raises many issues regarding workflow definition, enactment and potential re-enactment. This research explores the issues related to security-oriented decentralized workflow definition and enactment. The solution is respectful of the need for autonomy of service providers and allows each participating service to define their own access control policies. We also show how different security delivery models can be supported leveraging the pulling and pushing of security credentials.},

The predominant model for digital communication is that which relies on trusted third-parties, either as local servers or as cloud services. Meanwhile, emerging technologies such as internet-of-things are set to broadcast growing amounts of potentially sensitive information thereby making centralized architectures problematic for privacy and performance reasons and making decentralized networks ever more relevant. However, these third-parties play an important role in securing brokered communications and are essential in providing Authentication and Non-Repudiation according to current models. Clearly, such an approach cannot be used in peer-to-peer networks and there is need for a simple model applicable in fully decentralized networks to provide Non-Repudiation. This document proposes such a model, presents an implementation and discusses its application, particularly pertaining to implementing irrefutable trustless transaction mechanisms -- similar to blockchain -- in the realm of limited resources.},

 abstract = {The increasing number of smart systems provides more and more independently developed services. Though the services are intended to work autonomously, their participation within a collaboration will result in a synergy more than only the sum of the individual parts. The challenge to demarcate the individual services and their collaboration and to avoid mutual dependencies has been recently approached by utilizing the Concept of Roles, providing roles, which interact with other roles within a collaboration, and are performed by players. Roles can intermesh with their player and thereby change their behavior solely for the collaboration they are participating in. The collaborative nature of roles, i.e., inherently describing complex interactions, is highly beneficial to dynamic, autonomous composition of collaborative systems. This paper contributes a protocol for coordinated composition of role-based continuous service collaborations in decentralized smart computing environments. An experimental evaluation underlines the feasibility of a decentralized approach since discovery and composition of services can be performed in reasonably short time even in setups up to 150 services involved in a single collaboration.},

 abstract = {In a shift from the current research trend which is mostly geared towards centralizing access control of autonomous vehicles at intersection of the near future, the authors extend their previously presented intersection management model, which is fully decentralized. Even though it is the most efficient, central control requires fully automated connected vehicles, active vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, which introduces inherent security, privacy and feasibility issues. We simulate autonomous intelligent vehicles making local access decisions at isolated intersections, with only sensing and/or beacon information. The simulation proves to be collision-free. The extended management model is now able to account for various vehicle classes, all possible turns at the intersection and safe turning speeds. Compared to a standard signal controller, the proposed and improved model is again proven to be operationally more efficient.},

Besides requiring fast response time, increased security and privacy, they lack computational resources at the edge of the network. Such computational resources distributed closer to the edge represent the fundamental infrastructure of edge and fog paradigms. However, without advanced resource management techniques, the advantages of the paradigms are lost. In this paper, we present a novel distributed resource allocation algorithm with the purpose of enabling seamless integration and deployment of different applications in an IoT infrastructure. The algorithm decides: the (i) mapping of IoT application at the edge of the network, (ii) dynamic migration of parts of the application, such that Service Level Agreement (SLA) is satisfied. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss our approach and the potential to minimize the latency of different IoT applications.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things equips citizens with a phenomenal new means for online participation in sharing economies. When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning. This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections, accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.},

However, blockchain is still in its infancy and its future is highly controversial, arousing phenomenal enthusiasm, high expectations, and even intense criticism. The possible impacts of blockchain and its applications on the society could be fundamental and revolutionary, inevitably bringing unpredicted ethical challenges in the foreseeable future. Identifying the ethical challenges of blockchain is urgent and critically needed to ensure that blockchain is adopted ethically. However, discussions on the ethics of blockchain are largely insufficient, which leaves a void of theoretical understanding so far. In this paper, we provide a systematic discussion on the ethics of blockchain applications and map the main social challenges raised by its technology and applications. The paper starts with a review of the technological concepts and applications of blockchain. Then, it overviews the current research on the ethics of technologies and general research on blockchain to briefly introduce the authors' approach. Afterwards, a conceptual model of blockchain ethics research is developed. This research hopes to serve as an initial roadmap for the study of blockchain ethics, and to raise timely awareness and stimulate further debate on the ethics of blockchain in the IS community.},

 abstract = {We introduce two complementary approaches to monitor decentralized systems. The first approach relies on systems with a centralized specification, i.e., when the specification is written for the behavior of the entire system. To do so, our approach introduces a data structure that (i) keeps track of the execution of an automaton (ii) has predictable parameters and size, and (iii) guarantees strong eventual consistency. The second approach defines decentralized specifications wherein multiple specifications are provided for separate parts of the system. We study two properties of decentralized specifications pertaining to monitorability and compatibility between specification and architecture. We also present a general algorithm for monitoring decentralized specifications. We map three existing algorithms to our approaches and provide a framework for analyzing their behavior. Furthermore, we present THEMIS, a framework for designing such decentralized algorithms and simulating their behavior. We demonstrate the usage of THEMIS to compare multiple algorithms and validate the trends predicted by the analysis in two scenarios: a synthetic benchmark and the Chiron user interface.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework for decentralized monitoring of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, under the situation where processes are synchronous and the formula is represented as a tableau. The tableau technique allows one to construct a semantic tree for the input LTL formula, which can be used to optimize the decentralized monitoring of LTL in various ways. Given a system P and an LTL formula φ, we construct a tableau Tφ. The tableau Tφ is used for two purposes: (a) to synthesize an efficient round-robin communication policy for processes, and (b) to find the minimal ways to decompose the formula and communicate observations of processes in an efficient way. In our framework, processes can propagate truth values of both atomic and compound formulas (non-atomic formulas) depending on the syntactic structure of the input LTL formula and the observation power of processes. We demonstrate that this approach of decentralized monitoring based on tableau construction is more straightforward, more flexible, and more likely to yield efficient solutions than alternative approaches.},

A decentralized network that encourages the internet to operate from the smartphone or tablet of anybody instead of centralized servers. A decentralized implementation would be based on a peer-to-peer network that is dependent on a user community. Their machines connected to the internet will host the network, not a community of more powerful servers. Each site would be distributed across thousands of nodes on various devices. The data is therefore not contained, owned by private storage facilities. There is therefore no central point to hack, and no way for an oligarchy of entities to take control of it. A proposed alternative was formed based on a systematic literature review that demonstrates that Internet decentralization is what this modern technology needs in order to address not only the weaknesses of current servers including server down issue, hacking and data manipulation or single point of failure, but also to prevent companies from monetizing the data of citizens through their server and to market them to the advertisers.},

Many of these devices are often idle and constitute an untapped resource which could be used for outsourcing computation. Existing solutions for harnessing this power, such as volunteer computing (e.g., BOINC), are centralized platforms in which a single organization or company can control participation and pricing. By contrast, an open market of computational resources, where resource owners and resource users trade directly with each other, could lead to greater participation and more competitive pricing. To provide an open market, we introduce MODiCuM, a decentralized system for outsourcing computation. MODiCuM deters participants from misbehaving---which is a key problem in decentralized systems---by resolving disputes via dedicated mediators and by imposing enforceable fines. However, unlike other decentralized outsourcing solutions, MODiCuM minimizes computational overhead since it does not require global trust in mediation results. We provide analytical results proving that MODiCuM can deter misbehavior, and we evaluate the overhead of MODiCuM using experimental results based on an implementation of our platform.},

We identify the requirements of a decentralised Robinson list and the characteristics of a blockchain technology needed to support an implementation. Then, we present a general solution and a proof-of-concept implementation based on the Algorand technology. A preliminary performance evaluation suggest that also in terms of performance we can achieve satisfactory results.

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has enabled a thriving emergent ecosystem of tools and communities actively using decentralized systems. However, most blockchain infrastructure (e.g. Ethereum) requires users to pay some fees to execute their desired actions in these novel online services. To which extent an increase in the price of such fees negatively affects user activity? Would significant price surges deter users from using blockchain-enabled online services? In this work, we study the 2020 surge of transaction fee price in the Ethereum network, and analyze how that affected user activities. Our use cases are the blockchain-enabled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) from the platforms DAOstack and DAOhaus. Thus, we analyzed 5,580 transactions from 7,825 users grouped in 191 DAO communities, using a VAR model with a daily time series of the average fee value and the DAO operations. Our results show just a minor influence of the fee (gas) price and the activity of DAO users. The insensitivity of the activity to the fee price is an anomaly in a supposedly self-regulated market, and we consider this should be tackled in future implementations.},

It is most popular for enabling Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies. However, blockchain applications span beyond Finance, and recently it has been applied to decentralized governance. Blockchain-enabled "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations" (DAOs) have emerged as a new form of collective governance, in which communities may organize themselves relying on decentralized infrastructure. In this article, we introduce the concept of DAO and review the main software platforms that offer DAO creation as a service, which simplifies the use of DAOs to non-blockchain experts; namely: Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus and Colony. These platforms will be compared by showing their key features. Finally, we will review the available visualisation tools for DAOs, and we will introduce our open-source tool to plot DAOs activity, DAO-Analyzer. We will illustrate its potential with the case of the DAO Genesis Alpha, which is the main DAO of the DAOstack project.},

For example, when users ask for a fast and simple self-service, the industry may need a long and cumbersome process, and sometimes users are not sure whether they have a fair deal according to their contract. With the aim of enhancing the current bicycle insurance system in Denmark, we investigate the local market and develop BlockCycle, which is a blockchain-based bicycle insurance system. The basic idea is that insurance companies transform their insurance products into a smart contract, including the criteria of applying the product and the eligibility of compensating into program logic. When a smart contract is deployed, the immutability can ensure the deal integrity and protect both users and insurance companies from the threat of unauthorized manipulation. In addition, blockchain can provide a secure and simple way to decentralize data and services, which enables high availability and reliability. Our experimental results indicate the viability of our system.},

In this paper, we develop a blockchain-based platform for managing drone IoT operations while maintaining trust and security. The test-bed consists of IoT devices, a drone and blockchain-enabled gateways through which drones are controlled to replace malfunctioning devices. The latter are detected using Z-score observation algorithm which launches a smart contract and sends the drone with clear operation order. The results obtained in realistic agriculture use case highlight the utility of our proposition in decreasing signaling and operation time, improving the percentage of successful maintenance operations and providing trust and security when managing drones in an autonomous manner.},

The government sector is one of them. The potentials of DLTs are among the motivating reasons why most government agencies are looking to this technology to help make them become more efficient, accountable, cost-effective, and transparent. Some, on the other hand, are looking for ways in which the DLTs can help increase the trust in government agencies as well as various governmental institutions. Despite the endless potentials of the DLTs, they are still in infant stage and at the same time having a number of risks that may deter its future integration and use. This paper proposes a framework towards the integration of DLTs into government organizations of various levels like municipalities and public services that will help in introduction of them in governmental tasks such as digital ID management, secure document handling and voting while keeping them simple for administrators to use and apply in every organization and domain.},

In addition, we also rely on transfer learning for extra compression. This means that we train a relatively small model on top of a high quality pre-trained feature set that is fixed.

Most self-optimizing systems rely on an abstract model, with the majority relying on an abstract model representing the running software architecture to guide self-optimization decisions. However, existing approaches to self-optimization are centralized resulting in a single point of failure. This paper outlines a decentralized approach to self-optimization based on DARE, an architecture-based framework for providing component-based software systems with self-configuration, self-healing, and self-protection properties. We show how DARE services are extended to monitor and analyze the incoming message rate of components as well as how these services coordinate at runtime to self-optimize the controlled software system without losing any transactions. Experimental results demonstrate DARE's ability to achieve self-optimization at runtime and in a decentralized way.},

Blockchain, an emerging distributed ledger, has been considered by the research community as a potential solution for enhancing data security, integrity, and transparency in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, despite the emphasis of governments on the transparency of personal data protection practices, CAV stakeholders have not been successful in communicating appropriate information with the end users regarding the procedure of collecting, storing, and processing their personal data, as well as the data ownership. This article provides a vision of the opportunities and challenges of adopting blockchain in ITS from the “data transparency” and “privacy” perspective. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1)&nbsp;Considering the amount of personal data collected by the CAVs, such as location, how would the integration of blockchain technology affect transparency, fairness, and lawfulness of personal data processing concerning the data subjects (as this is one of the main principles in the existing data protection regulations)?

However, these technologies still have some unanswered issues, mostly related to data lookup and discovery. In this paper, first, we propose a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) system that efficiently manages decentralized keyword-based queries executed on data stored in DFS. Through a hypercube logical layout, queries are efficiently routed among the network, where each node is responsible for a specific keywords set and the related contents. Second, we provide a framework for the governance of the above network, based on a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) implementation. We show how the use of smart contracts enables organizational decision making and rewards for nodes that have actively contributed to the DHT. Finally, we provide experimental validation of an implementation of our proposal, where the execution of the same protocol for different logical nodes of the hypercube allows us to evaluate the efficiency of communication within the network.},

Due to the limited processing capacity of a single device node of CPS, the communication relationship between equipment is extremely complicated, and multi-hop device nodes may be passed through in the middle, so designing an efficient routing scheme for CPS is a serious challenge. CPS routing also faces a security crisis. System nodes may send viruses or erroneous results to user equipment, and user equipment may also refuse to pay for routing services to system nodes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a secure routing scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is used to ensure secure transactions between system nodes and user equipment. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is used, and two deep neural networks are used to train intelligent agent to achieve low-latency adaptive traffic scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed autonomous routing technology can reduce the system communication latency by about 31.7\%-45.4\%.},

 abstract = {Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications.In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we evaluated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.},

 abstract = {Centralized online social networks --- e.g., Facebook, Twitter and TikTok --- help drive social connection on the Internet, but have nigh unfettered access to monitor and monetize the personal data of their users. This centralization can especially undermine the use of the social internet by minority populations, who disproportionately bear the costs of institutional surveillance. We introduce a new class of privacy-enhancing technology --- decentralized privacy overlays (DePOs) --- that helps cOSN users regain some control over their personal data by allowing them to selectively share secret content on cOSNs through decentralized content distribution networks. As a first step, we present an implementation and user evaluation of Image DePO, a proof-of-concept design probe that allows users to upload and share secret photos on Facebook through the Interplanetary File System peer-to-peer protocol. We qualitatively evaluated Image DePO in a controlled, test environment with 19 queer and Black, Indigenous, (and) Person of Color (BIPOC) participants. We found that while Image DePO could help address the institutional threats with which our participants expressed concern, interpersonal threats were the more salient concern in their decisions to share content. Accordingly, we argue that in order to see widespread use, DePOs must align protection against abstract institutional threats with protection against the more salient interpersonal threats users consider when making specific sharing decisions.},

@article{10.1145/3529096,
 abstract = {As various smart services are increasingly deployed in modern cities, many unexpected conflicts arise due to various physical world couplings. Existing solutions for conflict resolution often rely on centralized control to enforce predetermined and fixed priorities of different services, which is challenging due to the inconsistent and private objectives of the services. Also, the centralized solutions miss opportunities to more effectively resolve conflicts according to their spatiotemporal locality of the conflicts. To address this issue, we design a decentralized negotiation and conflict resolution framework named DeResolver, which allows services to resolve conflicts by communicating and negotiating with each other to reach a Pareto-optimal agreement autonomously and efficiently. Our design features a two-step self-supervised learning-based algorithm to predict acceptable proposals and their rankings of each opponent through the negotiation. Our design is evaluated with a smart city case study of three services: intelligent traffic light control, pedestrian service, and environmental control. In this case study, a data-driven evaluation is conducted using a large dataset consisting of the GPS locations of 246 surveillance cameras and an automatic traffic monitoring system with more than 3 million records per day to extract real-world vehicle routes. The evaluation results show that our solution achieves much more balanced results, i.e.,&nbsp;only increasing the average waiting time of vehicles, the measurement metric of intelligent traffic light control service, by 6.8\% while reducing the weighted sum of air pollutant emission, measured for environment control service, by 12.1\%, and the pedestrian waiting time, the measurement metric of pedestrian service, by 33.1\%, compared to priority-based solution.},

@article{10.1145/3532857,
 abstract = {We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks — and, thereby, DeFi protocols — would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.},

 abstract = {Mobile devices generate and store voluminous data valuable for training machine learning (ML) models. Decentralized ML model training approaches eliminate the need for sharing such privacy-sensitive data with centralized entities by expecting each data owner that participates in an ML model training process to compute updates locally and share them with other entities. However, the size of state-of-the-art ML models and the computational needs for producing local updates in mobile devices prohibit the participation of mobile devices in decentralized training of such models. Split learning techniques can be combined with decentralized model training protocols to realize the involvement of mobile devices in model training while preserving the privacy of their data. Mobile devices can produce local updates by splitting the model they are training into multiple parts and delegating the processing of the computationally demanding parts to compute nodes. This work examines the impact of the number of available compute nodes and their interaction. We split ResNet101 ML model into 3,4, and 5 parts, keep the first and the last part in the data owner and assign the processing of the middle parts to compute nodes. Additionally, we analyze the training time when the compute nodes assist multiple data owners in parallel or are responsible for different model parts by forming a pipeline.},

This study aims at making this trade fraud free by using the powerful features of the blockchain like that of decentralization and a trustless environment by using different smart contracts that operate between multiple stakeholders in the ecosystem, the first contract creates a distributed ledger register for stakeholders, next quantifies CO2 consumptions and mints carbon tokens, third helps in verification of CO2 consumptions and the final contract is a DAO for voting on governance issues. Thus, this work proposes a blockchain based solution for trading of carbon credits to solve the problem of climate change.},

Any t + 1-of-n parties can generate standard EdDSA signatures. This scheme supports an arbitrary threshold (t, n) and has been proven to be secure against at most t malicious adversaries. The theoretical analysis (computation complexity and communication footprints) and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs efficiently on cloud servers and embedded devices. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is integrated with Tendermint, a blockchain framework that uses EdDSA, to generate keys and sign transactions in a decentralized manner, which indicates that this scheme is compatible with blockchains for supporting DeFi applications.},

 abstract = {Simulation remains the preferred option for testing new approaches in relation to Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) research. This is no different when it comes to road traffic congestion avoidance mechanisms that utilize VANETs. There are several examples of VANET-based approaches to road traffic congestion avoidance that are tested using simulations in the literature. Notwithstanding, the replicability and extensibility of many approaches are limited due to the fact that their implementations are not publicly available. In this work, based on prior work, a decentralized mechanism is designed and implemented to perform road traffic congestion avoidance in VANETs. Evaluation results show that due to vehicles having longer trip times, vehicular density in the road network can be up to 2.5 times higher in scenarios where the road traffic congestion avoidance mechanism is not in use. Unlike prior work, we make the implementation publicly-available to enhance its replicability and extensibility.},

@article{10.1145/3555126,
 abstract = {The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.},

 abstract = {Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) or blockchains have been steadily emerging and providing innovation in the past decade for several use cases, ranging from financial networks, to notarization, or trustworthy execution via smart contracts. DLTs are enticing due to their properties of decentralization, non-repudiation, and auditability (transparency). These properties are of high potential to access control systems that can be implemented on-chain, and are executed without infringement and full transparency.While it remains uncertain which use cases will truly turn out to be viable, many use cases such as financial transactions can benefit from integrating certain restrictions via access control on the blockchain. In addition, smart contracts may in the future present security risks that are currently yet unknown. As a solution, access control policies can provide flexibility in the execution flow when adopted by smart contracts.In this paper, we present our DEDACS architecture which provides decentralized and dynamic access control for smart contracts in a policy-based manner. Our access control is expressive as it features policies, and dynamic as the environment or users can be changed, or alternative policies can be assigned to smart contracts. DEDACS ensures that our access control preserves the desired properties of decentralization and transparency, while aiming to keep the costs involved as minimal as possible. We have evaluated DEDACS in the context of a Uniswap token-exchange platform, in which we evaluated the costs related to (i) the introduced overhead at deployment time and (ii) the operational overhead cost. DEDACS introduces a relative overhead of on average 52\% at deployment time, and an operational overhead between 52\% and 80\% depending on the chosen policy and its complexity.},

Two years ago the total value locked in DeFi systems was approximately 700m USD, now, as of April 2022, it stands at around 150bn USD. The frenetic evolution of the ecosystem has created challenges in understanding the basic principles of these systems and their security risks. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) we delineate the DeFi ecosystem along the following axes: its primitives, its operational protocol types and its security. We provide a distinction between technical security, which has a healthy literature, and economic security, which is largely unexplored, connecting the latter with new models and thereby synthesizing insights from computer science, economics and finance. Finally, we outline the open research challenges in the ecosystem across these security types.},

 abstract = {In the past, the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)” was used to refer to a loosely organized network of autonomous entities, such as a corporation, a cooperative, or a non-profit party. Since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs. The EVM can also run other applications such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a new type of blcokchain-based organization that uses smart contracts to perform tasks on a distributed scale. The smart contracts have organizational rules and operational logic embedded and automatically execute organizational decisions and proposals making it highly decentralized and more democratic. The DAOs are organizations that are not subject to legal, physical, or economic constraints, as well as the ability to operate outside the control of a single central authority or a single governing body. Because DAO is formed by many smart contract that operate together, which makes it highly decentralized and has a strong democratic system. This paper discusses the pros and cons of DAO, and the potential of DAO in community development, especially in non-profit organizations. It is hope to provide an overall picture of DAO, and the roadmap for future development of DAO on the right track.},

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions.

 abstract = {Data minimization is a legal principle that mandates the limitation of personal data to a necessary minimum in order to protect the privacy of individuals. In this light, we address ourselves to decentralized collaborative filtering systems in which individual users interact with each other instead of institutional recommendation providers to obtain recommendations. Decentralized collaborative filtering systems, in which data is distributed over all users, bear a privacy benefit over traditional centralized systems in which data is kept at a single authoritative node. We propose the first formal definition of data minimization for use in distributed systems in order to combine the privacy benefits of data minimization and data distribution. On the basis of this definition, we propose a distributed data minimization scheme based on Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) that solves the data minimization problem for decentralized collaborative filtering systems. Here, data minimization represents a collection minimization problem in which users aim to collect necessary minimum amounts of rating data from other users in the system. We find by means of simulation that the overall amount of data collected by all users can be reduced significantly (&gt; 14.65\%) without jeopardizing recommendation performance, when users coordinate data collection. We thus prove that users collect unnecessarily much data, when they do not coordinate data collection.},

Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models that support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. However, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

However, the training data often contains sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. Federated Learning has been proposed as a solution to mitigate privacy risks. Despite its advantages, Federated Learning still faces challenges such as the aggregator being a single point of failure, the existence of malicious participants, and the lack of incentives. Combining Federated Learning with blockchain technology could potentially address these challenges. In this study, we propose a new method for asynchronous Federated Learning using blockchain smart contracts. Our proposed method operates autonomously and in a decentralized manner without the need to trust any central organization, making it trustless. We propose an algorithm that motivates workers to submit high-quality models as quickly as possible. Workers’ behaviors are driven by incentive mechanisms. We deployed a smart contract on a local Ethereum blockchain and executed multiple workers. Our evaluation results demonstrate that learning converges and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional Federated Learning, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Smart contracts enable the enforcement of token economy policies, which facilitate the experimentation of radically new economic models. Recent studies investigated blockchain-based CCSs. Still, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing a CCS providing a token-based Universal Basic Income (UBI). We evaluate the Circles UBI decentralised application utility in delivering an unconditional income to its users, focusing on its main pilot project running in Berlin. We analyse the structural changes in the network, especially in relation to a subsidy program, involving local businesses. We also identify prominent users based on centrality measures, and investigate how the UBI was effectively spent. We adopt a method agnostic to the economic context to identify optimal aggregation windows for the temporal network of CCS transactions based on the Causal Fidelity (CF) index. This aims to provide static representations as accurate as possible in terms of sequential order of edges, which aspect was not considered in previous research on CCSs. Our findings suggest that the pilot project sustained the expansion of the economic network and the system facilitated trade in urban communities in Berlin.

We consider the problem of improving the throughput of a scaled model of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge: a two-stage bottleneck where four lanes reduce to two and then reduce to one. Although there is extensive work examining variants of bottleneck control in a centralized setting, there is less study of the challenging multi-agent setting where the large number of interacting AVs leads to significant optimization difficulties for reinforcement learning methods. We apply multi-agent reinforcement algorithms to this problem and demonstrate that significant improvements in bottleneck throughput, from 20\% at a 5\% penetration rate to 33\% at a 40\% penetration rate, can be achieved. We compare our results to a hand-designed feedback controller and demonstrate that our results sharply outperform the feedback controller despite extensive tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RL-based controllers adopt a robust strategy that works across penetration rates whereas the feedback controllers degrade immediately upon penetration rate variation. We investigate the feasibility of both action and observation decentralization and demonstrate that effective strategies are possible using purely local sensing.

The approach proposed in this project goes beyond previous works on stream reasoning, enabling the self-organization and coordination among distributed stream reasoners, based on techniques and principles inspired by Multi-Agent systems. On the one hand, it adds the ability to explicate processing goals, capabilities and knowledge, while on the other it exploits potential ways of interconnecting them in ways that expand their combined capacity/efficacy for managing highly dynamic flows of streaming knowledge.

 abstract = {Data collaboration enables multiple parties to pool data for deriving meaningful data insights. However, data misuse and unlawful data collection have led to precautionary measures being imposed by individual organizations to guide against data leakage and abuse. As a response, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has emerged as an attractive paradigm to facilitate data collaboration while being amenable to privacy-preserving data and knowledge sharing, cost reduction, and prediction accuracy improvement. Unfortunately, the participating parties in DFL tend to be heterogeneous with skew datasets and uneven capabilities. Inevitably, training and transmission costs, and the presence of free-riders pose challenges to the adoption and participation of DFL. The absence of centralized parameter servers further exacerbates the problem of evaluating the contribution of each individual party. Therefore, an effective incentive mechanism is essential to promote data collaboration.In this paper, we propose a novel Incentive-aware Decentralized fEderated leArning (IDEA) framework for facilitating data collaboration. Specifically, we first design a customizable reward scheme for heterogeneous parties to optimize their respective objectives such as higher model accuracy, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. To reward fairly to deserving parties while offering flexibility, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) incentive mechanism, which enables heterogeneous parties to learn their own optimal collaboration policy. We then design an efficient decentralized data collaboration algorithm that supports the customizable reward scheme based on individual objective-specific collaboration policy. We theoretically prove that the algorithm achieves a Nash equilibrium, which ensures the fairness of the corresponding rewards for parties. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework against four baselines on five real-world datasets. The results show that IDEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and accumulated reward.},

 abstract = {Federated learning enables collaborative AI training across organizations without compromising data privacy. Decentralized federated learning (DFL) improves this by offering enhanced reliability and security through peer-to-peer (P2P) model sharing. However, DFL faces challenges in terms of slow convergence rate due to complex P2P graphs. To address this issue, we propose an efficient algorithm to accelerate DFL by introducing a limited number of k of edges into the P2P graphs. Specifically, we establish a connection between the convergence rate and the second smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix of the P2P graph. We prove that finding the optimal set of edges to maximize this eigenvalue is an NP-complete problem. Our quantitative analysis shows the positive effect of strategic edge additions on improving this eigenvalue. Based on the analysis, we then propose an efficient algorithm to compute the best set of candidate edges to maximize the second smallest eigenvalue, and consequently the convergence rate is maximized. Our algorithm has a low time complexity of O(krn^2). Experimental results on diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in accelerating DFL convergence.},

We propose the first privacy-preserving consensus-based algorithm for the distributed learners to achieve decentralized global model aggregation in an environment of high mobility, where participating learners and the communication graph between them may vary during the learning process. In particular, whenever the communication graph changes, the Metropolis-Hastings method [69] is applied to update the weighted adjacency matrix based on the current communication topology. In addition, the Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) scheme [61] is integrated to facilitate privacy in reaching consensus of the global model. The article establishes the correctness and privacy properties of the proposed algorithm. The computational efficiency is evaluated by a simulation built on a federated learning framework with a real-world dataset.},

 abstract = {Since the beginning of this decade, several incidents report that false data injection attacks targeting intelligent connected vehicles cause huge industrial damage and loss of lives. Data Theft, Flooding, Fuzzing, Hijacking, Malware Spoofing and Advanced Persistent Threats have been immensely growing attack that leads to end-user conflict by abolishing trust on autonomous vehicle. Looking after those sensitive data that contributes to measure the localisation factors of the vehicle, conventional centralised techniques can be misused to update the legitimate vehicular status maliciously. As investigated, the existing centralized false data detection approach based on state and likelihood estimation has a reprehensible trade-off in terms of accuracy, trust, cost, and efficiency. Blockchain with Fuzzy-logic Intelligence has shown its potential to solve localisation issues, trust and false data detection challenges encountered by today’s autonomous vehicular system. The proposed Blockchain-based fuzzy solution demonstrates a novel false data detection and reputation preservation technique. The illustrated proposed model filters false and anomalous data based on the vehicles’ rules and behaviours. Besides improving the detection accuracy and eliminating the single point of failure, the contributions include appropriating fuzzy AI functions within the Road-side Unit node before authorizing status data by a Blockchain network. Finally, thorough experimental evaluation validates the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

 abstract = {Employee data can be used to facilitate work, but their misusage may pose risks for individuals. Inverse transparency therefore aims to track all usages of personal data, allowing individuals to monitor them to ensure accountability for potential misusage. This necessitates a trusted log to establish an agreed-upon and non-repudiable timeline of events. The unique properties of blockchain facilitate this by providing immutability and availability. For power asymmetric environments such as the workplace, permissionless blockchain is especially beneficial as no trusted third party is required. Yet, two issues remain: (1) In a decentralized environment, no arbiter can facilitate and attest to data exchanges. Simple peer-to-peer sharing of data, conversely, lacks the required non-repudiation. (2) With data governed by privacy legislation such as the GDPR, the core advantage of immutability becomes a liability. After a rightful request, an individual’s personal data need to be rectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain.To solve these issues, we present Kovacs, a decentralized data exchange and usage logging system for inverse transparency built on blockchain. Its new-usage protocol ensures non-repudiation, and therefore accountability, for inverse transparency. Its one-time pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees unlinkability and enables proof of ownership, which allows data subjects to exercise their legal rights regarding their personal data. With our implementation, we show the viability of our solution. The decentralized communication impacts performance and scalability, but exchange duration and storage size are still reasonable. More importantly, the provided information security meets high requirements. We conclude that Kovacs realizes decentralized inverse transparency through secure and GDPR-compliant use of permissionless blockchain.},

 abstract = {In recent years, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have become increasingly more robust through the use of advanced technologies and accurate AI/ML models. However, incidents of crash and other untoward events involving AVs still get reported from time to time. In such situations, it is imperative that the cause be established - whether there was a problem with the sensors, actuators, model parameters or any other factor impacting the driving decision of the AV that resulted in the crash. This requires multiple parties like the automaker, sensor manufacturers, model developers and actuator suppliers to access the data logged by the AV during driving till the time of the incident. Although collaborating entities, they do not necessarily trust each other, especially in sensitive situations like investigating a crash. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel blockchain based method called AVChain for verifiable logging of data for each AV that can be selectively shared with the relevant parties under appropriate access control mechanisms. Scalability is achieved through the use of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for storing the actual data while its hash is maintained in an enterprise blockchain like HyperLedger Fabric (HLF). We show the effectiveness and versatility of AVChain by generating data from CARLA - a widely used simulator for AVs, and invoking appropriate HLF chaincodes developed for this purpose. A browser based interface has also been designed to demonstrate the working of the complete infrastructure.},

 abstract = {Remote voting has become more critical in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak. Blockchain technology and its benefits such as decentralization, security, and transparency have given rise to proposals for blockchain-based voting systems. However, the traceability of blockchain transactions violates voter anonymity in existing proposals. Besides, transaction costs also need to be considered. Solutions that may cause repeated elections should be avoided for a low-cost scalable voting system. In this work, we propose ElectAnon, a blockchain-based, self-tallying, and ranked-choice voting protocol focusing on anonymity, robustness, and scalability. ElectAnon achieves anonymity by enabling voters to register with identity commitments and cast their votes via zero-knowledge proofs. Robustness is realized by removing the direct control of the authorities in the voting process by using timed-state machines. Each voter encodes the ballot into a single integer and blinds the vote off-chain while making the verification on-chain. This makes the protocol infinitely scalable in the number of voters. ElectAnon is also a solution for governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO): It includes a candidate proposal module and an algorithm-agnostic mechanism to plug-in different tallying methods easily. The Merkle forest extension is proposed for conducting even more trustless elections. ElectAnon is implemented with smart contracts based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a zero-knowledge gadget, Semaphore. The implementation also includes two different sophisticated tallying methods, Borda Count and Tideman. Experimental results show that a 40-voter and 10-candidate election can be implemented with the gas consumption reduced up to 89\% compared to previous works. While other studies could not exceed a 25,000-voter setup, ElectAnon has been observed to run safely for 1,000,000 voters. The implementation can be found at .},

 abstract = {Decentralized applications (dApps) consist of smart contracts that run on blockchains and clients that model collaborating parties. dApps are used to model financial and legal business functionality. Today, contracts and clients are written as separate programs—in different programming languages—communicating via send and receive operations. This makes distributed program flow awkward to express and reason about, increasing the potential for mismatches in the client-contract interface, which can be exploited by malicious clients, potentially leading to huge financial losses.In this article, we present Prisma , a language for tierless decentralized applications, where the contract and its clients are defined in one unit and pairs of send and receive actions that “belong together” are encapsulated into a single direct-style operation, which is executed differently by sending and receiving parties. This enables expressing distributed program flow via standard control flow and renders mismatching communication impossible. We prove formally that our compiler preserves program behavior in presence of an attacker controlling the client code. We systematically compare Prisma with mainstream and advanced programming models for dApps and provide empirical evidence for its expressiveness and performance.},

 abstract = {Modern industrial landscapes, like Industry 4.0, pose a formidable challenge: how to maintain high-performance levels in dynamic manufacturing environments while minimizing downtime for adaption? Control systems have to be capable of making real-time decisions between adaptation and task fulfillment yet to external, changing production goals. Centralized control systems promise ideal decisions based on global data, but need clean and extensive data. Decentralized multi-agent systems (MAS) instead may decide on local data, yet, the efficiency of decentralized MAS to adapt in dynamic manufacturing settings remains largely unexplored. Thus, we study the potential of a MAS of decentralized agents characterized by adapting exclusively with local information, in addressing the challenges posed by dynamic manufacturing environments. We illustrate the problem using a driverless transportation system for a manufacturing scenario where a control system guides Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in response to unforeseen disturbances and unknown product transportation tasks. We compare the decentralized MAS approach to an omniscient centralized control system, measure the performance of both systems and consider the communication efficiency among the MAS population. We show that decentralized agents with local information can adapt efficiently and shed light on their effectiveness in dynamic environments.},

Most existing FaaS systems are centralized, i.e., the infrastructure is owned and managed by a single cloud service provider. This character brings a few limitations. For instance, an end user will be bound with a specific cloud service provider and there is a risk of single point of failure. In order to mitigate these limitations, a natural idea is to build a decentralized FaaS system. In this paper, we propose DeFaaS, a novel system that uses blockchain technology and decentralized API management to build a decentralized FaaS system, which enables greater scalability, flexibility, improved security, and reliability. Specifically, DeFaaS uses a blockchain to create a decentralized registry of available functions (services) and manage their execution. An application interacts with the blockchain to discover and invoke functions securely and transparently. In addition to providing a reliable and scalable platform for decentralized FaaS, DeFaaS can support other distributed computing scenarios, such as dApps, volunteer computing, and multi-cloud service mesh. Overall, our proposed system represents a significant advance in the field of decentralized computing and has the potential to enable a wide range of exciting new applications and use cases.},

Indeed, DAOs are decentralized organizations, where the members implement their decisions using smart contracts. In the article, we introduce a simple framework for a DAO, and then we discuss some governance issues. In particular, we focus on how DAO members could be induced to dedicate sufficient time to voting sessions, for a proper functioning of the organization. Indeed, recent empirical research suggests how the members’ participation rate, to voting activities, has a meaningful positive correlation with to a DAO's performance. More specifically, we formalize the notion of attention time and propose a simple model for the so-called Holographic Consensus, a protocol introduced by the DAOStack platform to solve the issue of limited time dedicated to governance, discussing under what conditions DAO members may choose the so-called boosting voting procedure.},

 abstract = {Decentralized identity (DID), the idea of giving users complete control over their identity-related data, is being used to solve the privacy tension in the identity management of decentralized applications (Dapps). While existing approaches do an excellent job of solving the privacy tension, they have not adequately addressed the accountability and Sybil-resistance issues. Moreover, these approaches have a considerable gas overhead, making them impractical for Dapps. We presented Hades, a novel practical DID system supporting full accountability and fine-grained Sybil-resistance while providing strong privacy properties. Hades supports three aspects of accountability, i.e., auditability, traceability, and revocation. Hades is the first DID system that supports accountability in all these three aspects. Hades is also the first DID system that supports fine-grained Sybil-resistance, enabling Dapps to customize personalized Sybil resistance strategies based on users’ identity attributes. Hades can run efficiently on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We implemented and evaluated Hades. The benchmarks showed that Hades has the lowest gas cost incurred on EVM as far as we know. Also, we presented a case study on attribute-associated fair NFT distribution (“airdrops”) where all previous works failed, whereas we gave a solution leveraging Hades.},

 abstract = {The metaverse, as a rapidly evolving socio-technical phenomenon, exhibits significant potential across diverse domains by leveraging Web3 (a.k.a. Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

 abstract = {Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are decentralized digital tokens to represent the unique ownership of items. Recently, NFTs have been gaining popularity and at the same time bringing up issues, such as scams, racism, and sexism. Decentralization, a key attribute of NFT, contributes to some of the issues that are easier to regulate under centralized schemes, which are intentionally left out of the NFT marketplace. In this work, we delved into this centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT space through mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. Centralization-decentralization dilemma is the dilemma caused by the conflict between the slogan of decentralization and the interests of stakeholders. We first analyzed over 30,000 NFT-related tweets to obtain a high-level understanding of stakeholders' concerns in the NFT space. We then interviewed 15 NFT stakeholders (both creators and collectors) to obtain their in-depth insights into these concerns and potential solutions. Our findings identify concerning issues among users: financial scams, counterfeit NFTs, hacking, and unethical NFTs. We further reflected on the centralization-decentralization dilemma drawing upon the perspectives of the stakeholders in the interviews. Finally, we gave some inferences to solve the centralization-decentralization dilemma in the NFT market and thought about the future of NFT and decentralization.},

Its indivisible, unique, and verifiable characteristics can truly reflect personal assets and virtual assets to a certain extent. It is widely applied by users in art, games, collectibles and other areas. NFT is stored on the blockchain. The user's digital signature is embedded into the NFT record, which is distributed through a smart contract and verified by the blockchain consensus mechanism, thus solving the problem of identity confirmation in digital asset transactions. This paper makes a review of the main processes and key technologies in NFT applications. First, it introduces the life of NFT: minting, distribution, storage and circulation. Then, the key technologies of NFT are explained, including the blockchain smart contracts and consensus mechanisms in NFT distribution and transaction, the token standards that the minting and transaction process of NFT needs to use, and the important role of NFT in the field of web3. Finally, through the evaluation system of NFT, the problems existing in the current NFT applications and the future research direction are drawn out.},

 abstract = {Connected autonomous vehicles technology is expected to be an important component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). With the help of artificial intelligence, cognitive methods, software-hardware and sensor platforms, several relevant industry standards are being developed to enable connected vehicles. One significant challenge raised by connected vehicles is how the underlying communication infrastructure will be able to efficiently support them. In this article, we propose the Dynamic, Decentralized, Distributed, Delegation-based (D4) network control plane architecture, which aims at providing adequate communication support for connected vehicles. To our knowledge, D4 is the first framework to support on-demand network control decentralization. At its core, D4’s flexible network control delegation framework allows network control to be dynamically distributed on demand to address quality-of-service requirements of different connected vehicle services and applications. We demonstrate the benefits of D4 through a proof-of-concept prototype running on a fully reproducible emulation platform. Experimental results using a variety of real-world scenarios demonstrate that D4 delivers lower latency with minimal additional overhead. We also showcase the benefits of D4 when compared to traditional vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) approaches.},

To achieve this, blockchain technology is crucial as it enables the operation of decentralized applications with smart contracts serving as the foundation for system-user interaction. In this paper, we propose the minimum viable implementation of a similar social network called Brain Logger, which stores all necessary data in the NEAR blockchain network. Introducing a small fee for modifying data on the network ensures a solution to the aforementioned problems. The implementation includes a smart contract for blockchain networks and a web application frontend. The smart contract was developed using the NEAR software development kit in Rust, while the frontend was created in JavaScript using the React framework and Redux for local data storage.

In such systems, we see multiple loci of ownership or control, representing different parties or administrative domains. That is, the members of a decentralized system are, belong to, or represent different people or organizations. We use the term decentralized system to mean any system formed of autonomous entities, with a special interest in cases where the entities are heterogeneous. Autonomy here refers to the decision-making capacity of an entity, meaning that it decides for itself. In other words, autonomy reflects the freedom to act. Heterogeneity here refers to the design, construction, and configuration of an entity, meaning that it is potentially built on distinct grounds from any other entity. In other words, heterogeneity reflects the freedom of a designer to apply any reasoning method on any available information.},

Challenges in constructing such a system include path-planning for multiple multi-rotors. Accurate position estimation methods such as GNSS already exist for outdoor self-positioning; however, no optimal method has been established for the path-planning problem involving multi-rotors in dynamic and complex environments. Herein, in addition to the conventional artificial potential field method, we propose an extended function that introduces a rotational force field, which enables autonomous navigation from a starting point to the target while avoiding obstacles and local minima. Additionally, we realized autonomous decentralized formation control and navigation with multiple multi-rotors. This was achieved by applying a virtual spring-damper model between the multi-rotors based on the relative distance information calculated from global positions obtained by inter multi-rotor communication. To confirm the practicality of our proposed method, we generated a two-dimensional map from the three-dimensional model data of a real urban area and conducted simulations for various multiple multi-rotor applications, successfully demonstrating formation control and navigation in complex environments.},

 abstract = {The governance technology of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) provides an effective solution for solving existing organizational management issues. Governance mechanisms of DAOs are usually encoded in smart contracts in the form of rule sets and executed automatically. However, the mechanism’s logical flaws and code errors expose DAOs to unpredictable risks. Complex adaptive dynamics computer-aided design (CadCAD) can test the effectiveness of the mechanisms through simulation. Nonetheless, as DAOs are typical complex systems with social and engineering complexity, managing, controlling, and supervising their operation through traditional methods are difficult. The parallel intelligence theory based on artificial societies, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method provides an effective research framework and practical method for solving DAOs’ governance issues. Therefore, in this article, we propose a parallel mechanism verification method and execution system, namely, complex adaptive systems for computer-aided dynamic design (casCAD2) as an extension of cadCAD. Leveraging parallel intelligence and cyber–physical–social systems (CPSS), casCAD2 is capable of probing into the laws that govern system evolution within a simulated environment. It serves as a robust tool for verifying the efficacy of DAOs’ mechanisms and predicting their potential risks. We also build a parallel market-based anchoring mechanism (MAM) system to demonstrate how it can be used for DAOs’ mechanism verification. This study can provide a new research method and application system for DAOs’ effective governance.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), which connects billions of electrical gadgets over the internet, has completely transformed the digital world. In the present day, as traditional equipment become more autonomous and intelligent, IoT devices are crucial. Increased data transfer is one major problem where 5 g networks world is crucial. However, these Internet of Things (IoT) devices utilizecentralized architecture-based protocols, which may result in a number of security risks for the data. Virtual reality, autonomous robotics, self-driving cars, and security difficulties may all be resolved by integrating artificial intelligence with 5G wireless infrastructure. The main goal of the system is to increase user confidence without relying on external authority. Blockchain has become a crucial technology that keeps track of the network’s event records via a distributed ledger. For IoT devices, blockchain offers a safe, decentralized, and trustworthy ecosystem. IoT and blockchain integration, however, is not without its difficulties. For instance, poor throughput is a key problem. IoT devices need a substantially greater throughput than the 12 to 15 transactions per second that the Ethereum blockchain network can currently handle. On light of this, blockchains are unable to function in an IoT-based 5G network. The blockchain’s network is the factor that restricts throughput. The P2P network’s delayed transaction and block propagation prevents miners and verifiers from quickly mining and, respectively, verifying new blocks. Therefore, the main problem with IoT-based blockchains is network scalability. That is in our past work, we utilized a dispersed blockchain organization to defeat the issue of organization versatility, and in this article, we utilize the Pontoon agreement technique to help the throughput of the blockchain. Security is one more essential worry with IoT organizations. Unfortunately, the blockchain’s dispersed records are available to general society and delicate information is open to anyone on the organization; in any case, in these conditions, outsider altering isn't possible without uncovering the first items. We utilized zkLedger, a zero-information based cryptography-based arrangement, to address security challenges.},

Battery energy storage systems have begun to alleviate these issues. However, such systems face many financial challenges in their deployment and operation. This paper demonstrates the use of advanced distributed ledger technology with smart contracts to design a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) to manage the investments in these systems and optimise their operations. In this paper, a series of smart contracts have been designed, deployed, and tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of such a DAO framework for battery management. The interconnected smart contracts can manage the financing, governing, and revenue-sharing mechanisms, allowing investors to coordinate investment and vote on the battery energy storage system's operation (charge/float/discharge) for a given period. This interconnected smart contract design implementation demonstrates a novel and effective strategy for managing battery energy storage systems, decreasing barriers to entry for investors, thus, allowing a greater adoption of such technology.},

 abstract = {The advent of blockchain technology has paved the way for numerous innovations in online governance, with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) emerging as a prominent development, often referred to as “digital jurisdictions.” Despite experiencing remarkable growth, currently boasting nearly 7M users and   ${\$}$  18 billion in assets, DAOs remain relatively underexplored in the existing literature, particularly from an empirical perspective. This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness. Furthermore, our analysis can be replicated on other platforms or at different time periods to validate and contrast our conclusions.},

It operates as a decentralized and open ledger, offering additional benefits such as traceability and immutability, which greatly contribute to its desirability. Two important blockchain applications include Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) Marketplaces and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). NFTs are unique digital assets like artwork or music that can be bought and sold using cryptocurrency, ensuring both security and efficiency. On the other hand, DAOs are transparent organizations that make decentralized decisions. In our work, we have developed an integrated NFT marketplace and DAO that leverages NFT ownership to determine the weights of choices. The implementation is based on Ethereum ERC-721 tokens. However, the Proof of Stake (POS) consensus algorithm used in Ethereum 2.0 lacks fairness. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Delegated Reputation-based Proof of Elapsed Time consensus algorithm (DRPoET).

However, it still faces significant challenges, including concerns over data breaches and privacy, inefficiencies and limited fault tolerance in centralized management, and the challenge of ensuring data accuracy. This letter marks the inaugural report from a series of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) Trustworthy IoV Workshops, which aim to address these issues. In these workshops, we explore the concept of a decentralized IoV (DeIoV), underpinned by decentralized autonomous organizations and operations (DAOs), to facilitate trustworthy interactions between vehicles and other entities. The proposed DeIoV is structured in two layers: the local DAO layer and the global DAO layer. This dual-layer architecture distinguishes between real-time and non-real-time decision-making tasks, aiding in their efficient completion. To ensure data security, integrity, and accuracy, we employ blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow for mutual verification among adjacent members and utilize encryption algorithms. A reputation value-based voting mechanism for decision-making is also introduced, which helps prevent the monopolization of power through token-based systems, a common issue in traditional DAOs. Ultimately, we believe that DeIoV has the potential to create a trustworthy IoV ecosystem, contributing significantly to safe, secure, and collaborative autonomous driving.},

The proliferation of connected devices and machines brings forth a range of security concerns, including data tampering and unauthorized access.

Numerous established security measures, such as antivirus software, access control systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), have been identified in the literature as facing issues like centralized vulnerabilities, latency challenges, reliability issues, and single points of failure. As technology advances rapidly, the convergence of emerging technologies holds immense potential to revolutionize industrial automation. Among these promising technologies, blockchain and 6G stand out for their immense potential. With its decentralized and tamper-proof nature, blockchain has disrupted various sectors, while 6G offers unprecedented connectivity and lightning-fast data transfer speeds.

 abstract = {Without a doubt the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has been gaining attention over the last years. With the deployment of low cost sensors, a plethora of information is made available, giving rise to intelligent systems that combine data from multiple sources. Multiple IoT platforms have been developed to support different application domains such as smart cities, health, industry 4.0, etc. However, the vertical focus and usually isolated development of such platforms pose difficulties in offering cross-domain smart applications to meet society's needs. To this end, interoperability frameworks have emerged to allow the interplay of different platforms as well as the formation of federations among the entities contributing IoT devices through such platforms. The decentralized nature of IoT data federations presents challenges when it comes to their management and governance, particularly in ensuring fairness, security, trustworthiness and transparency among its members. However, permissioned blockchain-based solutions hold significant potential in addressing these issues due to their inherent characteristics. In this work, we propose a blockchain solution based on the Hyperledger Fabric for the decentralized management of IoT federations and their gover-nance by utilizing voting-based configurable rules that abide to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The solution includes smart contracts for the secure creation and management of federations exposed through APIs, as well as a voting application for enabling the DAO dynamic. Our solution demonstrates a secure, trustworthy and transparent way for the formation and membership control of IoT federations, that holds potential for extension with smart contracts related to data marketplace, as well as reputation and tokenization mechanisms.},

This paper proposes an IoV Information Management System (IIMS) based on parallel intelligence and blockchain to address these challenges. By leveraging the decentralized, immutable, and traceable nature of blockchain, combined with the incentive mechanisms and collaborative models of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), a secure and trustworthy data sharing platform is established for collaborative analysis, business cooperation, and innovative applications of IoV data. The proposed approach utilizes the decentralized nature and data backup capabilities of blockchain to mitigate the single point of failure issues associated with centralized servers. Additionally, the anonymity, immutability, and traceability features of blockchain ensure the privacy, security, and integrity of data sharing. Moreover, the incentive mechanisms and DAO solutions within the blockchain promote data sharing among vehicles while ensuring data quality.},

Typically, IoV involves extensive data sharing and centralizes data storage, posing significant security challenges for sensors. Although blockchain offers a decentralized platform for data exchange, it can’t guarantee the reliability and trustworthiness of each sensor in IoV. Besides, blockchain primarily focuses on technical aspects and falls short of establishing a comprehensive organizational and operational framework for sensors. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization and Operation) into sensors and propose a new framework for reliable sensor operations in IoV, namely SensorDAO. It utilizes the collaboration of on-chain and off-chain layers to support various scenarios at the application layer. We also provide key technical elements to construct SensorDAO, including distributed storage, intelligent algorithms, governance, and incentive mechanisms.},

The parallel architecture on M2OS is proposed, including the parallel interactive actual M2OS and artificial M2OS. Among them, the artificial M2OSs provide digital infrastructures for organizations to operate, collaborate, and make decisions in the virtual space, and conduct computational experiments to evaluate management decisions and predict future states of the actual M2OS. Through parallel execution and closed-loop feedback between the artificial and actual M2OSs, the management and control, experimentation and evaluation, as well as learning and training of the actual M2OS can be realized. Moreover, the functional layers of M2OS, including the infrastructure layer, data layer, scenario layer, modeling layer, decision layer, and application layer, are discussed. These layers work together to support the intelligent, autonomous, collaborative, and adaptive nature of the M2OS, and facilitate data-driven decision-making, optimize business operations, and empower managers with real-time actionable insights. The proposed M2OS paradigm has great potential to transform the management paradigm and opens up new possibilities for intelligent and collaborative decision-making.},

However, most DAOs rely heavily on token-centric value systems as well as allocate decision-making authority and yield-sharing rights according to the held tokens, which often lead to monopolization of power and rights. To address this issue, this paper contributes to propose a truly democratic organization model, named True Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), that does not count upon tokens and is guided by principles of contribution-based and on-demand allocation. We first discuss the design of TAOs, including their infrastructures, power structures, and value systems, and then provide a technical roadmap for implementing TAOs in the DeSci context.

 abstract = {Given n participants, leader election (LE) is the process of designating one of them as the leader or coordinator. LE is ubiquitous in distributed computing and blockchain and has a wide variety of applications ranging from lotteries to proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In a blockchain setting, we normally require our LE protocol to be decentralized, lead to a consensus about the elected leader, and be fair, i.e. elect each participant with the same probability $1 /n.$ Traditional blockchain LE solutions reduce the problem to decentralized uniform sampling from the set $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}.$ This reduction leads to approaches which are either vulnerable to manipulation, or fail to guarantee fairness, or require inefficient procedures such as verifiable delay functions (VDFs) and publicly-verifiable secret sharing (PVSS), thus making them gas-inefficient and costly when implemented as smart contracts.In this work, we observe that fair leader election can be achieved without explicit decentralized random number generation (RNG). In other words, the intuition behind our work is that RNG is a strictly harder problem than LE. This is because every LE participant is assumed to prefer to be chosen as the leader, e.g. the participant prefers to win the lottery or be the miner for the next PoS block. Thus, they will refrain from actions that would reduce their chance of being selected. This game-theoretic incentive can be exploited to design much simpler protocols for LE in comparison to RNG, by ensuring that dishonest behavior can only reduce the winning chances of the participant.Specifically, we propose PureLottery, a protocol inspired by single-elimination knockout tournaments in sports such as football. We show that PureLottery selects the winner uniformly at random and provides strong game-theoretic guarantees to incentivize honest behavior. PureLottery is also strongly bias-resistant in the sense that every honest participant is guaranteed to win the lottery with probability at least $1 /n$, even if an adversary controls all of the other $n -1$ players. In other words, dishonest behavior will never increase an adversary’s chances of being elected, even if the adversary controls all but one of the participants. Finally, PureLottery is a simple protocol that can be efficiently implemented as a smart contract and uses a small amount of gas in practice. We provide an open-source implementation of the protocol, dedicated to the public domain with no copyright.},

However, it cannot reflect the user's perception, which is considered a crucial consideration by these services nowadays. Therefore, the emergence of Quality of Experience (QoE) is a potential solution. QoE can be measured via many parameters provided by Internet Service Providers (ISP), Application Service Providers (ASP), or end-users. However, privacy concerns hinder data sharing between the parties involved. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a QoE estimation mechanism that leverages Federated Learning. This mechanism aims to guarantee data privacy when no party needs to disclose their data to others. Moreover, the proposed mechanism incorporates the concept of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to mitigate the risk of a single point of failure in the centralized architecture of Federated Learning. It enables all participants to evaluate and select the model efficiently. The experimental results illustrate that the proposal surpasses the centralized solutions and guarantees data privacy.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology is used often as a merger with other technologies to achieve a high level of security, privacy, and robustness and to handle issues, such as maliciousness of nodes, privacy leakage, the selfishness of nodes, communication delays, and high execution and transaction costs. There is currently a lack of a comprehensive system for automating and cost-effectively managing vehicle repairs, maintenance, and other associated services. To solve such issues, we proposed a novel futuristic comprehensive model that integrates a blockchain-based framework to safely record vehicle maintenance, validate repair services, and oversee parts inventory. It employs smart contracts and consensus protocols to secure communications and data storage, thus reducing data breaches and vulnerabilities from single-point failures. A reward system is embedded within the network to encourage positive behavior and deter detrimental actions. We also incorporated advanced privacy-ensuring methods, like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty computation, to safeguard sensitive data while preserving its utility. Our model features automatic detection and response mechanisms for node failure, improving network resilience by 25% thus also providing a 20% reduction in execution, operational costs, and scalability with an enhancement of 15%, underscoring the model’s efficiency in vehicular repair and maintenance activities. Results and simulations clearly depict the overall performance and efficiency in terms of security, privacy, node failure, and the management of vehicle repairs with respect to other closely related models.},

The proposed decentralized management algorithm solves the problem of a rapidly growing IP address table due to the increasing number of system users. We propose an approach focused on optimizing the direct links between the hosts of the storage network and dynamically calculating their ratings. Host ratings are calculated based on network latency, uptime, and processor performance. The rating calculation is a two-stage process, the second stage takes CPU performance into account. This model offers a tiered structure of masterhosts, where first-level masterhosts accumulate host IP addresses and provide access to their database, maintaining the current state of the decentralized storage network, second-level masterhosts aggregate the IP addresses of first-level masterhosts into groups, thus creating a hierarchical network structure. The paper evaluates the proposed approach by calculating the consumed service traffic required to maintain each host, and compares the decentralized storage scheme and the centralized scheme. The results show that the decentralized system is superior to the centralized one in terms of data availability and has a higher efficiency of disk space utilization due to savings on data duplication, which proves the possibility of effective existence of such a system, and thus its application to ensure the integrity and availability of stored data.},

 abstract = {The incorporation of edge computing has become essential in the big data and Internet of Things age to tackle issues related to latency, real-time processing, and data scale. This paper delves into the imperative need for edge computing within the context of big data environments. Distributed deep learning methodologies are explored, encompassing a diverse array of deep learning models. Particularly, a novel paradigm named Data Forwarding based Decentralized Deep Neural Network (DF-DDNN) is introduced to achieve low latency IoT-Edge computation. In order to reduce latency in Io T ecosystems, the DF-DDNN model makes use of edge devices’ processing capabilities. By strategically distributing data processing and computation at the edge, this model seeks to overcome inherent limitations of conventional Io T architectures, with a keen focus on network, processing, and overall latencies. The research provides a thorough performance evaluation that compares the DF-DDNN model’s performance versus conventional IoT models in a number of areas. The outcomes demonstrate how much better the suggested DF-DDNN model is than traditional IoT systems. Notably, improvements are evident in terms of reduced network latency, accelerated processing speeds, and overall latency mitigation. This research underscores the critical importance of embracing edge computing in the context of big data and deep learning applications. The DF-DDNN model emerges as a promising avenue for advancing IoT-Edge computation, effectively addressing latency concerns and augmenting the performance of IoT-enabled systems.},

 abstract = {Under the social manufacturing context, geographically distributed and decentralized micro-and-small-scale manufacturing enterprises (MSMEs) self-organize into manufacturing communities (MCs), a type of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In MCs, MSMEs share their manufacturing resources for order-driven cross-enterprise production cooperation, which is supported through blockchain-based order tracking. However, the application of blockchain also brings concerns about data security and privacy protection to MSMEs, which leads to disputes between MSMEs about which data should be stored in the blockchain. For this problem, a granular-computing-based data-sharing decision-making (GrC-DSDM) method is proposed. In the GrC-DSDM method, a fuzzy proximity relationship is used to describe the familiarity between MSMEs in the same MC, and MC familiarity is obtained based on the granular space derived from the fuzzy proximity relation. A fuzzy preference relation is used to representMSMEs’ preferences for all metadata related to the order, and a group decision-making method is applied to calculate the preference values for all metadata. Through constructing the mapping relationship between MC familiarity and preference values of all metadata, we can determine which metadata should be shared with the MC for blockchain-based order tracking. The GrC-DSDMmethod can support group decision-making on data sharing among MSMEs in the same MC. The implementation of the GrC-DSDM method is demonstrated through the example of a sheet metal parts processing MC. It is expected that the GrC-DSDMmethod will provide a basis for enabling blockchain-based order tracking inMCs.},

In a STA system, tenants are autonomous decentralized entities who can create subtenants, and grant their resources (including private services and data) to their subtenants. The isolation and sharing relations between parent-child tenants, sibling tenants or non-related tenants are more complicated than those between tenants in MTA. It is important to keep resource private, and at the same time, allow them to be shared, and support application customizations for tenants. This paper provides a formal definition of a new tenant-based access control model based on Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC) for STA in SaaS. Autonomous Areas (AA) and AA-tree are proposed to describe the autonomy of tenants, including their isolation and sharing relationships. Different resource sharing methods are given out to create and deploy the access control scheme in STA models.},

 abstract = {Emerging healthcare systems are expected to leverage new Internet of Things (IoT) trends to enable preventive and personalized medicine. However, the success of such systems is entirely dependent on the ability to preserve patient privacy. This paper proposes a decentralized ontology based system architecture that caters to a healthcare organization's privacy needs as well as its enterprise security policy concerns considering futuristic IoT and Electronic Health Records (EHR) trends in healthcare. To identify privacy infringements and organizational policy violations across the institution, our proposed HealthCare Security and Privacy (HCSP) ontology is utilized in conjunction with three agent-level filters: the Exception Creation Agent (ECA), the Policy Mapping Agent (PMA), and the Privacy Assurance Filter (PAF). Preliminary evaluation has shown effectiveness of the HCSP ontology in terms of detection of policy compliance to HIPAA standards.},

 abstract = {Tailoring treatment and clinical decision making to a person's unique characteristics is the next milestone for healthcare informatics, but for it to be accomplished, big data analytics for identifying risk factors and other hidden patterns among patients become paramount. In future these analytics will take the form of multicenter observational research, for which data preparation is vital. Specifically, quality data must be obtained in a timely manner while protecting the privacy of patients in the health records shared among researchers. Furthermore, the coordination and cooperation of a fluctuating number of medical data sources containing these records for clinical data distribution is an additional requirement in multicenter studies. Thus, we propose an autonomous decentralized, privacy-enabled data preparation architecture and novel SEDTM algorithm to meet these requirements, censuring sensitive information via filtration, and extracting relevant clinical data with a fully automated approach. Our evaluation demonstrates a 40% - 60% increase in the retrieval of quality patient data, compared to traditional semantic similarity, for our proposed SEDTM algorithm.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has become a promising approach in many domains. It first came up with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, where it is used to maintain a distributed ledger, a public list of all transactions. It is assumed that the use of a blockchain as a cryptocurrency, or in general for financial services, was just the first stage, called Phase 1.0. The second phase began with the integration of smart contracts. In Phase 3.0, the focus lies on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which efficiently implement smart contracts. In the future, it is assumed, that by the use of DAOs many benefits for the public sector emerge. In this paper, blockchain applications of Phase 2.0 and 3.0 are analyzed for measuring instruments under legal control. An example are smart meters, where by smart contracts, a new coin/token within the blockchain can be created whenever the electric meter rotates. Promising areas of application in legal metrology, like a decentralized audit trail to log, e.g., software updates and hinder uncertified manipulations, the complete automation of the legally supervised update mechanism by smart contracts, or an alternative to public key infrastructures are being proposed in this paper.},

Modern blockchains underpin a variety of applications: from designing a global identity to improving satellite connectivity. In our research we look at the ability of blockchains to store metadata in an increasing volume of transactions and with evolving focus of utilization. We further show that basic approaches to improving blockchain privacy also rely on embedding metadata. This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use. Metadata are relevant to any blockchain, and our analysis considers primarily bitcoin as a case study. The paper concludes that simultaneously with both expanding legitimate utilization of embedded metadata and expanding blockchain functionality, the applied research on improving anonymity and security must also attempt to protect against blockchain abuse.},

This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency. In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases - Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

We will touch both types of blockchain and corresponding applications in this tutorial. In particular, we will summarize existing blockchain technologies and applications, elaborate the principles of designing and implementing secure DApps, and analyze the security concerns therein. Through concrete examples, we will discuss common practices and pitfalls, such as on-chain/off-chain interaction, randomness generation, and various corner cases. If time permits, we will also go through the implementation of the cloud-based blockchain backbone that powers this tutorial, possibly covering a layered architecture, and discuss deployment choices and security issues along the way. The tutorial will be interspersed with revisiting the security and implementation rules, so that participants are expected to readily apply the tutorial content into real-world practice.

 abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.},

 abstract = {The software development life cycle (SDLC) starts with business and functional specifications signed with a client. In addition to this, the specifications also capture policy / procedure / contractual / regulatory / legislation / standard compliances with respect to a given client industry. The SDLC must adhere to service level agreements (SLAs) while being compliant to development activities, processes, tools, frameworks, and reuse of open-source software components. In today's world, global software development happens across geographically distributed (autonomous) teams consuming extraordinary amounts of open source components drawn from a variety of disparate sources. Although this is helping organizations deal with technical and economic challenges, it is also increasing unintended risks, e.g., use of a non-complaint license software might lead to copyright issues and litigations, use of a library with vulnerabilities pose security risks etc. Mitigation of such risks and remedial measures is a challenge due to lack of visibility and transparency of activities across these distributed teams as they mostly operate in silos. We believe a unified model that non-invasively monitors and analyzes the activities of distributed teams will help a long way in building software that adhere to various compliances. In this paper, we propose a decentralized CAG - Compliance Adherence and Governance framework using blockchain technologies. Our framework (i) enables the capturing of required data points based on compliance specifications, (ii) analyzes the events for non-conformant behavior through smart contracts, (iii) provides real-time alerts, and (iv) records and maintains an immutable audit trail of various activities.},

The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations’ costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.},

 abstract = {Ever since the invention of Bitcoin by the pseudonymous Satashi Nakamoto, cryptocurrency has provoked debate in banking and finance sectors, and is sometimes considered a potential successor to fiat currency. Blockchain, the new technology underpinning decentralised and immutable databases, has seen much discussion as a potentially game-changing development. Although many industries are exploring its value, the technology has thus far made only minor impacts. A rapidly expanding base of research has emerged on blockchain's role as a potential disruptor in the electrical energy industry. However, it may be difficult to distinguish hype from more imminently plausible impacts. This paper attempts to serve as a guide for engineering managers wishing to make sense of blockchain's potential in electricity. This is accomplished by formulating a novel blockchain industry disruption framework, which exists across three tiers. These tiers extend from ideas with the least effect on an industry to total revolutionary concepts that could completely transform an industry. This taxonomy is constructed by examining existing research into disruption hierarchies and blockchain classification methods. Through the lens of this taxonomy, a literature review is performed on blockchain's role in energy to draw out themes and ideas characterising each tier. The potential likelihood of real-world application of various ideas are discussed, considering how established industries may be affected or disrupted. The authors provide some conjecture here. Finally, courses of action are suggested for those whose sector may be affected by blockchain.},

 abstract = {In this article, a decentralized optimal tracking control problem has been studied for a large-scale autonomous vehicle system with heterogeneous system dynamics. Due to the ultralarge number of agents, the notorious “curse of dimension” problem as well as the unrealistic assumption of the existence of reliable very large-scale communication links in uncertain environments have challenged the traditional multiagent system (MAS) algorithms for decades. The emerging mean-field game (MFG) theory has recently been widely adopted to generate a decentralized control method that deals with those challenges by encoding the large scale MASs’ information into a novel time-varying probability density functions (PDF) which can be obtained locally. However, the traditional MFG methods assume all agents are homogeneous, which is unrealistic in practical industrial applications, e.g., Internet of Things (IoTs), and so on. Therefore, a novel mean-field Stackelberg game (MFSG) is formulated based on the Stackelberg game, where all the agents have been classified as two different categories where one major leader’s decision dominates the other minor agents. Moreover, a hierarchical structure that treats all minor agents as a mean-field group is developed to tackle the assumption of homogeneous agents. Then, the actor-actor–critic–critic-mass ( $A^{2}C^{2}M$ ) algorithm with five neural networks is designed to learn the optimal policies by solving the MFSG. The Lyapunov theory is utilized to prove the convergence of  $A^{2}C^{2}M$  neural networks and the closed-loop system’s stability. Finally, a series of numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.},

 abstract = {There has been a growing interest in adapting blockchain technologies to the specific needs of the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to develop a variety of blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications such as smart cities and Industry 4.0, where smart contracts play an important role. After briefly reviewing recent progress on BIoT, we explore the symbiosis of blockchain with other key technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, while putting our focus on the emerging Tactile Internet for advanced human-to-machine interaction. Our interest is in exploiting the concept of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which executes smart contracts and requires the involvement from humans to perform certain tasks that autonomous AI based software agents and robots themselves cannot do. In our search for synergies between human-agent-robot teamwork (HART) and the complementary strengths of the DAO, AI, and robots, we decentralize the Tactile Internet by leveraging mobile end-user equipment via partially or fully decentralized multi-access edge computing, and crowdsourcing of human expertise to decrease the completion time of physical tasks in the event of unreliable feedback forecasting of teleoperated robots. Finally, we aim at enhancing the human capabilities of unskilled crowd members by using our proposed nudge contract.},

 abstract = {A decentralized application involves multiple autonomous principals, e.g., humans and organizations. Autonomy motivates (i) specifying a decentralized application via a protocol that captures the interactions between the principals, and (ii) a programming model that enables each principal to independently (from other principals) construct its own protocol-compliant agent. An agent encodes its principal's decision making and represents it in the application. We contribute Deserv, the first protocol-based programming model for decentralized applications that is suited to the cloud. Specifically, Deserv demonstrates how to leverage function-as-a-service (FaaS), a popular serverless programming model, to implement agents. A notable feature of Deserv is the use declarative protocols to specify interactions. Declarative protocols support implementing stateful agents in a manner that naturally exploits the concurrency and autoscaling benefits offered by serverless computing.},

 abstract = {Eighteen percent of the world’s population do not have access to electricity, impeding economic, social, and human development. The electricity access challenge can be attributed to the significant investment gap needed to finance new power projects, requiring new and innovative financing options. Independent Power Projects, funded, built, owned, and operated by the private sector and constituted via a special purpose vehicle—a legal entity whose sole purpose is implementing a power project—have become one of the fastest-growing sources of investment in the electricity sector. The limitations of traditional finance sources, including high credit, liquidity, margining, third-party, legal, and process risks, means that funds for these projects are expensive and raised only after a long and arduous process. The present article addresses these challenges by describing a novel decentralized autonomous organization, a blockchain-agnostic special purpose vehicle underpinned by a trio of autonomous mechanisms—mobilization, collateralization, and settlement. These mechanisms enable seamless finance mobilization for the special purpose vehicle from a location-independent crowd, revenue collection from the electricity buyer in a risk-mitigated manner, and disbursal of eventual project revenues to investors.},

 abstract = {A smart contract is known to be useful for automating business processes triggered by specific events caused by IoT sensors, data feeds, or other applications. A blockchain-based smart contract management system is an innovative technology that is foreseen to automate future business-to-business (B2B) processes. Blockchain is well-known to play a central role in business process re-engineering by optimizing business workflow operations, especially in multi-party arrangements. This paper presents a multi-organizational smart contract management system in which a user can create, deploy, and execute smart contracts. This paper consists of two parts; in the first part, we have compared existing smart contract management systems based on different characteristics that can play a vital role in selecting a particular system for a specific business need. In the second part, while utilizing and building upon the state-of-the-art techniques, we have built a framework for a blockchain-based smart contract and transaction management system. It is a unified architecture supporting DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and organizational level blockchain-based smart contract execution. There are two types of separate blockchains utilized in the proposed framework, i.e., SBlockchain and TBlockchain. SBlockchain is used to store smart contracts, whereas all the data generated by the smart contracts is stored inside the TBlockchain. In addition, each smart contract has some terms and clauses necessary for some event execution. Various components of the framework and their implementation have been described in detail with the help of relevant use-cases.},

 abstract = {Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.},

 abstract = {Ride-hailing and ride-sharing applications have recently gained popularity as a convenient alternative to traditional modes of travel. Current research into autonomous vehicles is accelerating rapidly and will soon become a critical component of a ride-hailing platform’s architecture. Implementing an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing platform proves a difficult challenge due to the centralized nature of traditional ride-hailing architectures. In a traditional ride-hailing environment the drivers operate their own personal vehicles so it follows that a fleet of autonomous vehicles would be required for a centralized ride-hailing platform to succeed. Decentralization of the ride-hailing platform would remove a roadblock along the way to an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing platform by allowing owners of autonomous vehicles to add their vehicle to a community-driven fleet when not in use. Blockchain technology is an attractive choice for this decentralized architecture due to its immutability and fault tolerance. This thesis proposes a framework for developing a decentralized ride-hailing architecture that is verifiably secure. This framework is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. The evaluation of the implementation is done by applying known security models, utilizing a static analysis tool, and performing a performance analysis under heavy network load.},

 abstract = {Autonomous connected vehicles are revolutionizing the automotive industry vision and impacting their business model. This trend will likely impact other related industries and their business model such as automotive insurance companies, tier-II automotive manufactures, and automotive maintenance service companies. The growing number of connected vehicles will require new policy formulation by the government about privacy and security issues in the era of massive digitalization and automation. Organizations such as 3GPP and IEEE are evolving standards that address security issues for connected vehicles. However, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will play a significant role in 5G networks and beyond, we address the privacy and security issues with a blockchain-based intelligent digital forensics system for autonomous connected vehicles (ACVs) in a connected smart world incorporating artificial intelligence. The proposed system includes a novel algorithm for the autonomous connected vehicles and the users' security and privacy. We utilize short randomizable signatures to anonymously authenticate witness's identities and to protect the witnesses' privacy. Then, we leverage fine-grained access control based on ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption for evidence access and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system by simulating the proposed model, its computational costs and communication overhead by implementing a prototype on a local Ethereum blockchain network platform. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed system. We envision the application of the proposed system to ensure security and privacy of ACVs and their security applications for use with 5G-V2X and future XG-V2X networks.},

 abstract = {The fast proliferation of digital twin (DT) establishes a direct connection between the physical entity and its deployed digital representation. As markets shift toward mass customization and new service delivery models, the digital representation has become more adaptive and agile by forming digital twin networks (DTNs). The DTN institutes a real-time single source of truth everywhere. However, there are several issues preventing DTNs from further application, including centralized processing, data falsification, privacy leakage, lack of incentive mechanism, and so on. To make DTN better meet the ever changing demands, we propose a novel block-chain-enabled adaptive asynchronous federated learning (FedTwin) paradigm for privacy-preserving and decentralized DTNs. We design Proof-of-Federalism (PoF), which is a tailor-made consensus algorithm for autonomous DTNs. In each DT's local training phase, generative adversarial network enhanced differential privacy is used to protect the privacy of local model parameters, while a modified Isolation Forest is deployed to filter out the falsified DTs. In the global aggregation phase, an improved Markov decision process is leveraged to select optimal DTs to achieve adaptive asynchronous aggregation while providing a rollback mechanism to redact the falsified global models. With this article, we aim to provide insights to forthcoming researchers and readers in this under-explored domain.},

They employ distributed consensus mechanisms that were subject to a lot of research in recent years. While most of such research focused on security and performance of consensus protocols, less attention was given to their incentive mechanisms which relate to a critical feature of blockchains. Unfortunately, while blockchains are advocating decentralized operations, they are not egalitarian due to existing incentive mechanisms. Many current consensus protocols inadvertently incentivize centralization of mining power and inequitable participation. This paper explores and evaluates alternative incentive mechanisms for a more decentralized and equitable participation. We first evaluate inequality in existing Proof of Stake (PoS) based incentive mechanisms, then we examine three alternatives in which rewards scheme is more partial to low-stakeholders. Through simulation, we show that two of our alternative mechanisms can reduce inequality and offer an attractive solution for sustainability of blockchain-based applications and DAOs.},

The technology could potentially lead to a new generation of decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous organizations. Unfortunately, there is simply too much misinformation regarding blockchain. Most notably, blockchain has been used as a buzzword synonymous with data immutability and trust. In fact, this is far from the truth. In this article, we provide a concise description of exactly what blockchain technology is, including its design principle, building blocks, core innovations, and benefits. This is followed by an analysis of data immutability. We show that to create an insurmountable barrier against attacks on data immutability, decentralization and system scale are both necessary. Based on this analysis, we further dissect what benefits private and consortium blockchain could actually offer when decentralization is removed. We show that private and consortium blockchain cannot offer data immutability and trust as many works in the literature have claimed or implied. Instead, the centralized version of blockchain technology provides an elegant solution to achieving fault tolerance and atomic contract execution, which could make private and consortium blockchain useful for enterprises that would like to provide high availability to their customers and for their internal operations.},

 abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has presented itself as the next building block in a market-based crypto economy. While the jury is still out on its (potential) benefits for society at large, it has become apparent that DeFi is qualitatively different from earlier blockchain applications because of its governance model based on Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This decentralized governance model has enabled the evolution from peer-to-peer to peer-to-network applications, allowing more sophisticated financial transactions to take place on permissionless blockchains. This paper analyzes the political economy of decentralized governance, the means by which the law attempts to govern DeFi, and alternative roles that the law could occupy in the governance of DeFi. It is found that as applications grow more complex, the need for politicized decision-making increases, but that enforcing regulatory perimeters becomes even more challenging. It is therefore suggested that the law could occupy a more facilitative, incentive-based role in the governance of DeFi as opposed to an enforcement-oriented role. By way of illustration, a state-organized DAO serving as forum to reach rough consensus on network-to-network matters is proposed. It is concluded that rethinking the rule and role of law in DeFi serves purpose as it provides state actors with additional tools and policy options in a transnational environment hostile to formal state intervention.},

They aim to coordinate access among IoT devices to the shared wireless medium. More specifically, contention-free MAC protocols are known to be more efficient than contention-based ones in the case of high traffic load and dense networks. To face the main communication challenges between IoT devices such as collisions and conflicts as well as mobility, it is crucial to design an efficient MAC protocol. To do so, several solutions have been proposed in the literature. Among recent proposed solutions, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and game theory models were used to revolutionize the communication in IoT networks, especially for devices with high mobility degree. In our survey, we first start by studying the challenges and requirements of communication in wireless networks. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent contention-free MAC protocols existing in the literature. Next, we compare these solutions based on important metrics such as QoS, robustness, fairness etc., and discuss the relationship between MAC protocols, network type and network mobility. Finally, we investigate a future research direction to solve a major problem, which is the network disruption and delay tolerance in IoT wireless mobile networks.},

Most of previous research studies employed the AI and the BT separately with limited efforts providing a conceptual view for possible convergence in real-life applications. Nevertheless, such efforts do not address construction applications. This research introduces a novel tailorable decentralized AI system that utilizes BT as a computing-oriented technology. The proposed system is developed as an inference engine while having a number of interesting features. First, the system validates and audits the decision-making process while sharing and recording the input data and the computed outcomes in a synchronized trusted manner. Second, the system allows the formation of distributed AI repository that can absorb and manage concurrent use-cases while targeting different scopes and covering diverse AI branches. Third, it provides a workable solution for the AI applications' distribution problem, which hinders their wide employment. Fourth, the introduced system guarantees sustainable versioning and evolution over time for AI applications based on their performance or the newly acquired data. A case study of estimating the construction cost for road projects is provided to illustrate the system’s workability and demonstrate its performance.},

Virtual power plants (VPPs) have emerged as an important paradigm for aggregating and managing numerous DERs. This paper proposes a decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) multilayer energy trading framework to facilitate optimized coordination of DERs within a VPP context. A control center, prosumers, and service operators constitute the model’s multi-layered architecture. Profits from feed-in tariffs, ancillary services, and P2P sales are optimized for revenue while expenses are minimized using a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Smart contracts enable prosumers to trade energy units in the Ethereum blockchain with ease via a participatory web platform. The effectiveness of the framework in synchronizing power supply and demand within the VPP by coordinating the charging and discharging of storage systems in accordance with consumption patterns is demonstrated through performance evaluation. In contrast to conventional centralized architectures, the proposed framework utilized decentralized architecture efficiently consolidates and optimizes distributed energy resources (DERs) to improve grid stability and renewable energy utilization.},

We use an exploratory, inductive approach to comprehensively examine how DAOs are currently governed and the ramifications of this. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 DAO members from a variety of sectors to identify how they arrange their voting processes, distribute collaborative decision-making, and maintain their tokens. Three themes emerge from the thematic analysis of the data: (1) voting structure, (2) proposal management, and (3) token management. Participants describe the notion of DAOs as closely aligned with stewardship philosophy, encompassing collaborative and altruistic activity toward a common purpose. However, the operations and methods implemented are more oriented toward agency viewpoints due to their reliance on incentive-based processing and are based on a lack of trust among DAO stakeholders.

We propose a system in which a decentralized network of manufacturing machines and computing nodes can enable automated transparency of an organization’s capability, third party verification of such capability through a trail of past historic events and automated mechanisms to drive paperless contracts between participants using ‘smart contracts’. Our system decentralizes critical information about the manufacturer and makes it available on a peer-to-peer network composed of fiduciary nodes to ensure transparency and data provenance through a verifiable audit trail. We present a testbed platform through a combination of manufacturing machines, system-on-chip platforms and computing nodes to demonstrate mechanisms through which a consortium of disparate organizations can communicate through a decentralized network. Our prototype testbed demonstrates the value of computer code residing on a decentralized network for verification of information on the blockchain and ways in which actions can be autonomously initiated in the physical world.

 abstract = {Presently, majority of car-pooling services depend on a central third party which makes these platforms susceptible to data privacy, security concerns, and a single point of failure. Moreover, drivers and passengers are charged with different services fees by the electric mobility service provider. The emergence of emerging technologies such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) can foster trust, boost electric car-pooling business models. Hence, DLT is utilized to store electric car-pooling trips, drivers, and passengers’ information to ensure user privacy and maintain security. Similarly, social practice theories such as Community of Practice (CoP) is progressively considered as a significant structure within societies as it aids the development and sharing of resources across groups. But very little attention has been devoted to examined how CoP can be employed to support the design of decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling. Leveraging CoP and DLT, this paper proposes a decentralized community of practice-based model that enables drivers to publish electric car-pooling services and passengers to be matched to a driver without depending on a trusted third party. A systematic literature review was adopted to collect data and a case study of a decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling was presented. Findings from this study highlights conceptualization of CoP for improving decentralized on-demand electric car-pooling and provide insights on efficient decentralized mechanisms for electric car-pooling. Theoretically, this article identifies the current problems, state-of-the-art of decentralized electric car-pooling. For policy implications this study provides guidelines to effectively govern and manage the development of on-demand electric car-pooling for sustainable public transportation.},

However, the integration of prosumers in the smart grid to facilitate bidirectional flows of energy and information depends on intelligent operations of energy systems and flexible structures of the existing energy markets. But existing energy trading mechanisms are faced with issues of trust, privacy, security, and energy pricing determination. Also, there are fewer studies based on a citizen-centric prosumer approach. Thus, there is need to provide reliable solutions that addresses the aforementioned challenges faced by prosumers in LEC.

The architectural model supports trust, data privacy, security, and energy pricing determination using AI and smart contracts to provides real-time energy trading monitoring, easy access, control, and immutable logs to unearth underlying energy demand and supply patterns thereby supporting citizen-centric prosumer approach. Finally, a use case scenario of DLT and AIoT for prosumption operations is presented.},

This is clearly constituting one of the major threats to users privacy and to their right to be-left-alone. Decentralization has then been considered as the panacea to privacy issues, especially in the realms of OSNs. However, with a more thoughtful consideration of the issue, it could be argued that decentralization, if not designed and implemented carefully and properly, can have more serious implications on users privacy rather than bringing radical solutions. Moreover, research on Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) has shown that there are more challenges to their realization that need proper attention and more innovative technical solutions. In this paper, we discuss the issues related to privacy preservation between centralization and decentralization, and we provide a review of available research work on decentralized privacy preserving services for social networks.},

However, DAOs are facing challenges that can be divided into two categories, including policy-based and technical challenges. Detecting misbehaving nodes is a crucial challenge that is considered in both categories. Designing mechanisms to report malicious behaviors while maintaining anonymity is essential for the survival and efficiency of DAOs. In this paper, we clarify the problem, and introduce Blockchain-Based Anonymous Reporting (BBAR) as a collective monitoring mechanism in DAOs with its requirements and implementation methods.},

 abstract = {Without a doubt, blockchain, as one of the most valuable technological advancements, has been introduced over the past decade and has played a significant role in the industrial revolution. The emergence of other technologies derived from blockchain, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and the Metaverse, has fundamentally transformed people’s daily lives and profoundly impacted future versions of digital businesses. This study explored the evolution of digital businesses in the near future, with a specific focus on the two primary technologies mentioned above. First, we reviewed DeFi-based technologies, including GameFi, SciFi, SocialFi, and others which serve as foundational building blocks for future jobs and businesses. Second, we examined Metaverse-based jobs, such as Metaverse-based academies and markets which are expected to be launched as commonly used businesses. Ultimately, this study provides several guidelines, such as how to use DeFi 2.0 and apply centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi)-based platforms. Additionally, it offers future directions for launching these businesses, including controlling the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in practical applications, utilizing cloud-assisted models for the Metaverse, and providing conditional privacy for future Metaverse-based businesses.},

 abstract = {Context
Decentralized autonomous organizations are a new form of smart contract-based governance. Decentralized autonomous organization platforms, which support the creation of such organizations, are becoming increasingly popular, such as Aragon and Colony. Selecting the best fitting platform is challenging for organizations, as a significant number of decision criteria, such as popularity, developer availability, governance issues, and consistent documentation of such platforms, should be considered. Additionally, decision-makers at the organizations are not experts in every domain, so they must continuously acquire volatile knowledge regarding such platforms.
Objective
Supporting decision-makers in selecting the right decentralized autonomous organization platforms by designing an effective decision model is the main objective of this study. We aim to provide more insight into their selection process and reduce time and effort significantly by designing a decision model.
Method
This study presents a decision model for the decentralized autonomous organization platform selection problem. The decision model captures knowledge regarding such platforms and concepts systematically. This model is based on an existing theoretical framework that assists software engineers with a set of multi-criteria decision-making problems in software production.
Results
We conducted three industry case studies in the context of three decentralized autonomous organizations to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision model in assisting decision-makers. The case study participants declared that the decision model provides significantly more insight into their selection process and reduces time and effort.
Conclusion
We observe in the empirical evidence from the case studies that decision-makers can make more rational, efficient, and effective decisions with the decision model. Furthermore, the reusable form of the captured knowledge regarding decentralized autonomous organization platforms can be employed by other researchers in their future investigations.},

 abstract = {Research on smart connected vehicles has recently targeted the integration of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks with Machine Learning (ML) tools and distributed decision making. Among these convergent paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) allows the vehicles to train a deep ML model collaboratively, by exchanging model parameters (i.e., neural network weights and biases), rather than raw sensor data, via V2X links. Early FL approaches resorted to a server-client architecture, where a Parameter Server (PS) acts as edge device to orchestrate the learning process. Novel FL tools, on the other hand, target fog architectures where the model parameters are mutually shared by vehicles and synchronized in a distributed manner via consensus algorithms. These tools do not rely on the PS, but take advantage of low-latency V2X links. In line with this recent research direction, in this paper we investigate distributed FL methods for augmenting the capability of road user/object classification based on Lidar data. More specifically, we propose a new modular, decentralized approach to FL, referred to as consensus-driven FL (C-FL), suitable for PointNet compliant deep ML architectures and Lidar point cloud processing for road actor classification. The C-FL process is evaluated by simulating a realistic V2X network, based on the Collective Perception Service (CPS), for mutual sharing of the PointNet model parameters. The performance validation considers the impact of the degree of connectivity of the vehicular network, the benefits of continual learning over heterogeneous training data, convergence time and loss/accuracy tradeoffs. Experimental results indicate that C-FL complies with the extended sensors use cases for high levels of driving automation, it provides a low-latency training service, compared with existing distributed ML approaches, and it outperforms ego learning with minimal bandwidth usage.},

 abstract = {The quantity and capabilities of smart devices and sensors deployed as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) and accessible via remote microservices is set to rise dramatically as the provision of interactive data streaming increases. This introduces opportunities to rapidly construct new applications by interconnecting these microservices in different workflow configurations. The challenge is to discover the required microservices, including those from trusted partners and the wider community, whilst being able to operate robustly under diverse networking conditions. This paper outlines a workflow approach that provides decentralized discovery and orchestration of verifiably trustable services in support of multi-party operations. The approach is based on adoption of patterns from self-sovereign identity research, notably Verifiable Credentials, to share information amongst peers based on attestations of service descriptions and prior service usage in a privacy preserving and secure manner. This provides a dynamic, trust-based framework for ratifying and evaluating the qualities of different services. Collating these new service descriptions and integrating with existing decentralized workflow research based on vector symbolic architecture (VSA) provides an enhanced semantic search space for efficient and trusted service discovery that is necessary to support a diverse range of emerging edge-computing environments. An architecture for a dynamic decentralized service discovery system, is designed, and described through application to a scenario which uses trusted peers’ reported experiences of an anomaly detection service to determine service selection.},

 abstract = {The impacts of climate change are predicted to negatively impair the improvements made towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), especially in developing countries. Uncertainty on specific actions and strategies remains, leading to a research-implementation gap. For Ecuador, one of the key challenges to local adaptation are the institutional capacities of the decentralized autonomous governments (GAD, Spanish acronym). Therefore, the objective of this study is firstly to apply a capacity development strategy developed by GIZ (2013a) in the context of limited knowledge and resources and secondly gain a deeper understanding of climate action in Ecuador on a provincial level. The case study is based on an experimental participatory workshop in the coastal province of Santa Elena, Ecuador. The applied methodology has three components: firstly, semi-structured expert interviews on climate action in Ecuador; secondly, the participatory workshops with technicians and employees of the provincial government, its analysis together with a pre-, post- and two-months-after the workshop follow-up survey; thirdly, the analysis of the workshop is complemented by a peer validation of the co-facilitators. The analysis of the workshop suggests that in a context of limited institutional capacity, an understanding of climate change terminology, vulnerability and adaptive capacity is crucial to interpret predictions and to motivate action. Additionally, results indicate that pairing the content of the seminar with elements of project management might also strengthen local planning and longevity of rural development measures. Overall, the methodology of GIZ might therefore not be suitable in the local context due to its fast pace and difficult terminology. A more promising approach to foster local climate action is the Design-Thinking (DT) methodology due to its easier accessibility. Based on the insights of the case study a capacity development strategy incorporating DT offers lessons learnt for practitioners aiming to promote local climate action in comparable institutional contexts of limited knowledge and resources. As limited knowledge and resources are often main barriers to climate action, developing capacity building strategies will in turn foster climate action.},

To cope with critically deficient water services, a local NGO supported by different donors has promoted decentralized water systems (DWS) that have spread in the city outskirts, based on a model with original features compared to other African experiences. Here, we intend to provide an empirically grounded and analytically sound inquiry into the relevance, efficiency and sustainability of these DWSs in the context of the megacity of Kinshasa. First, we analyze water provision data from the national water utility and compare these to the detailed operational results of the DWSs to estimate the magnitude and efficiency of this alternative mechanism. Second, the principles identified by Elinor Ostrom as being crucial for institutions to successfully manage commons provide us with a fruitful analytic framework to assess DWS performance and sustainability. We show that some of these criteria are broadly met, but the fulfillment of other criteria is still uncertain. We conclude with a balanced assessment of the efficiency and sustainability of this approach and identify the key challenges.},

However, little is known about how DeFi protocols assure users of the safety of their investments. This paper provides the first empirical evidence on DeFi audit services that check and verify the smart contracts underlying these protocols. Using data on 316 of the largest protocols, we find that those vetted by more smart contract auditors and by higher quality auditors have higher TVL and that these protocols have higher market capitalization (native token values). Using an event study approach, we document that TVL and token values significantly increase after a protocol's first audit, especially those involving a high-quality auditor. We also find that protocols with more auditors and higher audit quality exhibit a smaller drop in TVL and token values after the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, which reduced aggregate DeFi TVL by almost 65%. Overall, our findings suggest that DeFi users and investors perceive audits as providing assurance regarding the safety of their deposits and investments.},

Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric’s test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain.},

In the first phase, a secure data aggregation through 6G sensors is performed at the data plane. Then, in the second phase, the aggregated data is sent to the 6G-enabled NFV control plane to leverage resource allocation to connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) through edge nodes via service container operations. In the third phase, management plane operations are designed that includes registration and auction smart contracts (SC) for connected autonomous vehicle owner (CAVO) and CASVs over the BC with public/private pairs fetched from interplanetary file systems (IPFS). The proposed scheme is compared against existing NFV schemes like distant, edge, and SDN-based edge control. At 20 CASVs, 6Blocks achieves an edge-service latency of 0.05ms against 0.76ms, 0.27, and 0.15ms for cloud, edge, and SDN-edge schemes, respectively, with high connection density of 107 nodes, at maximum utilized IPFS bandwidth of 0.2 Mbps. Then, we validate the trust of our model through the automated validation of the internet security protocol and applications (AVISPA) tool and modeled the vehicle and sensor nodes.

 abstract = {Decentralized aquifer recharge programs are an alternative to centralized stormwater aquifer recharge systems and can improve groundwater tables in urban areas. In a decentralized aquifer recharge program, households and property-owners collect and store rainwater from rooftops and replenish aquifers through small gravity-fed recharge wells. This research presents a micro-trading rainwater for aquifer recharge (MRAR) system as a decentralized peer-to-peer water market that can recharge groundwater resources. Through a decentralized water market, households act as prosumers who collect and sell rainwater to consumer households and convey traded water via a shared aquifer. This research develops an agent-based modeling framework as an approach to evaluate the performance of a MRAR system to replenish groundwater resources and reduce energy required to pump water. Agents represent (1) prosumers that collect rainwater, sell rainwater to consumers, and replenish the groundwater system through dry wells, and (2) consumers that exert irrigation demands, buy rainwater from prosumers, and pump water from the groundwater system. The agent-based model is coupled with a groundwater flow model to evaluate the effects of micro-trading on groundwater resources. The agent-based modeling framework is applied for a virtual city to assess the performance of a MRAR system for scenarios that vary in the ratio of consumers to prosumers, location of prosumers and consumers, and aquifer properties. Model outcomes demonstrate the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers based on the volume of traded water, improvements in groundwater head, and improvements in unit energy of water. Findings demonstrate that the optimal ratio of consumers to prosumers is consistent across different values for hydraulic conductivity. The location of prosumer and consumer households affects the unit energy of water and has a negligible effect on the groundwater table and total energy consumed to pump water. This manuscript proposes and demonstrates MRAR as a new decentralized water system and provides a modeling approach to assess the performance of a MRAR system to improve urban groundwater resources.},

However, current energy trading models struggle to effectively track emissions and incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. This study introduces a novel, blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading carbon allowances, designed to empower prosumers and revolutionize energy consumption patterns. Utilizing blockchain technology, the platform enables direct, transparent, and secure transactions between prosumers, creating a decentralized market where they can set their own prices for carbon allowances. This dynamic and competitive environment empowers prosumers to take control of their energy consumption and incentivizes the adoption of sustainable practices. The platform also incorporates a decentralized reward system targeting specific consumption habits, promoting behaviors that reduce carbon emissions. Empirical evidence and theoretical justification within the study highlight the platform’s potential to transform energy consumption patterns. The transparent and verifiable nature of blockchain technology addresses the limitations of existing centralized and aggregator-based trading methods. The proposed platform provides a robust framework for tracking carbon emissions, promoting sustainable consumption, and empowering prosumers to actively participate in the energy transition. This innovative solution addresses the challenges faced by prosumers in the energy market, paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable future.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new approach to the decentralized Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problem. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of decentralized localization using low-density maps built with low-cost sensors. This problem is challenging at different levels. Indeed, each vehicle localization tends to drift over time independently of one another making the global localization of a fleet hard to achieve. To counter this effect, called SLAM inconsistency and which has been stated numerous times in the literature, we introduce a model to represent the natural drift of SLAM algorithms. Its integration inside an Extended Kalman Filter is explained along with simulations validating its use. The second part of this paper presents the fusion architecture designed to solve the different problems arising in a decentralized scheme. It avoids data incest, which is an important source of inconsistency, and integrates the previously mentioned SLAM drift in the estimates produced. This architecture also separates the SLAM classically used for mono-vehicle applications from the high-level decentralized part offering flexibility regarding sensors and algorithms at a low-level. Other aspects, involved by the multi-vehicle settings, are also taken into account (communication losses, latencies, desynchronizations, unknown initial positions of the fleet members and data association). The whole algorithm has been tested in various scenarios with vehicles equipped with a single camera and an odometer. The results, from both simulated and real scenarios, show that our approach can work in real time with very small bandwidth requirements.},

In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.},

 abstract = {The Line-less Mobile Assembly System paradigm (short LMAS) provides necessitated flexibility, especially for large-scale products as customer demands for individualized products persist and product life-cycles remain short. To make LMAS advantages operationally usable in an industrial context, it requires a suitable control system to connect multi-purpose assembly resources and to autonomously configure transient assembly stations. Therefore this paper reviews the relevant literature to identify the necessary components of such architectures. Depending on the control system’s intention and use cases, the properties of the organizational paradigm, an adequate ontology and basic design patterns regarding the distribution and order-relationships of the system entities are to be defined conceptually. For the implementation, a role model, an interaction model, and a data model are required. Due to the utilization of mobile multipurpose resources and the possibility of factory shopfloor reconfiguration by transient stations, existing approaches do not meet LMAS inherent properties. Consequently, we present a suitable decentralized multi-agent control system approach.},

Due to the innovative characteristics of decentralization, transparency, immutability, and anonymity, blockchain applications break new ground for users' decision-making in an operations environment. There is a lack of evidence regarding herding in blockchain technology in general and its potential effect on blockchain application platforms in particular. In response to this new technological phenomenon, we studied whether and how herding behaviors take place in the context of blockchain applications for operations in this research. We propose two new variables related to the operation of the blockchain application (i.e., technical assurance and decentralized management efforts) and a new variable related to user identity (i.e., identifiability). We found evidence of the existence of herding by utilizing the objective data of approximately 0.1 million transactions on a leading blockchain application platform providing self-service and collateral-based lending services. Our empirical findings also reveal that technical assurance and decentralized management efforts reduce users' herding tendencies. Moreover, we found that the higher the identifiability, the lower the users' herding tendency, and the less they are affected by technical assurance and decentralized management efforts.},

Many studies have been published showing the potential of this disruptive technology in many fields and this number is growing exponentially in recent years. This enormous amount of papers calls for a more systematic approach to analyse the overall trend in this research field. A bibliometric approach based on performance analysis and network analysis techniques is used to examine the evolution of blockchain technology research. Firstly, this paper contributes to the body of literature by discussing the most influential countries, authors, subject areas and journals of the current blockchain research. Secondly, this paper identifies six main clusters of blockchain-related research contributions and, based on the analysis on centrality and density measures, it classifies research themes in motor themes, basic themes, emerging or disappearing themes, and specialised themes. Despite the majority of contributions belong to the computer science subject area, many papers belonging to the technology management subject area provide pivotal insights for practitioners and policy makers. Specifically, they may exploit the results of this research to rethink many traditional processes in the light of blockchain technology implementation, exploit the benefits of the four TRs to manage processes, automate common tasks, generate actionable results, and improve daily operations.},

One of the sectors that can benefit from this technology is the online betting industry. According to Statista, the total value of transactions carried out in this industry will be 92.9 billion dollars in 2023. Therefore, the need to make transactions more transparent is undoubtedly one of the main requirements of the betting industry, which promotes continuous technological development in the search for ideal solutions. This “technology” allows the creation of records that cannot be falsified. The applicability of this technology in the betting industry can be very attractive in terms of ensuring greater transparency in transactions. Furthermore, in order to decentralize the organization, it is also intended to implement a DAO governance model. This model aims to solve a centralized governance problem and, therefore, consists of governance based on the code and not on a single person/entity. In the scope of this paper, it was possible to demonstrate through a proof-of-concept solution, the applicability of Blockchain and the DAO governance model in a bookmaker. Thie solution was designed and implemented on the Ethereum Blockchain platform, using smart contracts. The results obtained in the comparison study showed that the solution is viable and presents advantages compared to traditional solutions.},

The decentralized strategy presented in this article allow UAVs to self-organize into linear formation, optimize their coverage paths, and adapt to agent failures, thereby ensuring efficient and adaptive mission execution. The strategy has been tested and validated on two different platforms: the inter-UAV communication performance is evaluated on NS-3 simulator to measure metrices such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, delay, and routing overhead within the UAV swarms, while mission efficiency and fault tolerance is analyzed on robot operating system framework, and visualized on Gazebo simulator with real-time parameters. Through experimental results, we show that, after proper tuning of control parameters, the approach succeeds in flock formation with high level of fault tolerance, offering higher efficiency in terms of mission time, transmission delay, packet delivery rate, and control overhead, when compared to the benchmark approaches.},

 abstract = {The impacts of climate change and decreasing local resources are increasingly threatening the resilience and sustainable management of urban areas and infrastructures worldwide. To cope with such threads and vulnerabilities, urban sustainability and resilience oriented plans have been developed. Accordingly, policy makers need to learn how to properly integrate urban sustainability with urban resilience principles and practices in the re-shaping of urban agendas. In order to highlight the future potential of integrating transformative resilience principles into the general sustainability approach, this paper provides a critical review of a recent and successful urban regeneration and development plan, the “Mexico City Green Plan”. This paper also discusses a feasibility study for urban redevelopment and transition towards resilience in Mexico City, in order to illustrate the necessity and potential of urban resilience for the improvement of the life prospects of disadvantaged inhabitant groups. The Valle del Chalco neighborhood in Mexico City is presented as an example, whereby resilient and sustainable urban transformation was achieved through an integrated and sustainable decentralized water management and infrastructure plan. In practice, the terms ‘Sustainability’ and ‘Resilience’ can be exploited to justify conventional, non-sustainable urban development practices. The results discussed in this paper demonstrate the necessity of the integration of transformative resilience principles within sustainable urban redevelopment and regeneration. The main findings are i) Policy makers underestimate the potential of urban resilience in shaping more sustainable urban futures, since they only understand resilience as the flipside of specific vulnerabilities, ii) The building of urban resilience within sustainable urban transitions and redevelopment can effectively foster people empowerment, particularly in combination with the decentralization of resources management systems, and iii) The main challenge for the implementation and execution of transitions processes towards urban resilience and sustainability is the elimination of political barriers.},

Currently, government-decentralized power is below its optimal level.

Furthermore, local governments present broadly positive sentiment in their reports. This strengthens the negative impact of inadequate government-decentralized power.},

 abstract = {With an increasing demand for authenticated data exchange between jurisdictions, ensuring the privacy and security of data interactions is crucial for national security, public health, and economic vitality, becoming a fundamental national infrastructure. Current solutions can be categorized into two types: fully decentralized autonomous systems based on blockchains or centralized solutions that rely on authoritative centers such as certification authorities (CAs). In reality, a balance needs to be struck between guaranteed authority and privacy independence. A certain authority is needed as an authorization guarantee, and decentralization is required to ensure privacy and the independence of the authority. This paper proposes a novel scheme, CT-MA-ABE (Cross-Trust Multiple Authorization Attribute-Based Encryption), to address these issues by implementing MA-ABE for cross-border institutional authorization interactions, utilize blockchain certification authority (BCA) for credibility and encryption-based authorization to protect attribute data privacy. This solution integrates the role of 'notary' in cross-border interactions, addressing the supervision problem in fully decentralized approaches while also considering the trust issue in centralized systems. This paper also introduces the Universal Certificate Authority Pool (UCAP), an innovative hybrid federated authorization method, creatively utilizing the implied authorization conditions of attributes to create a flexible and transitive authorization mechanism based on attribute relationships and extensions, enhancing privacy protection and improving the speed of authorization matrix calculation. The successful deployment of the system between the legal jurisdictions in South China, Zhuhai and Macau as a critical infrastructure component for securing data interactions further demonstrates its effectiveness as a reliable and secure solution.},

By virtue of the multi-agent system theory, this paper presents an organizational architecture for fractionated spacecraft, which not only enables autonomous cluster operations but also facilitates its non-traditional attributes. Within this organizational architecture, a decentralized framework is proposed to solve cluster reconfiguration problems based on primal and dual decomposition, where subgradient methods are adopted to include reconfiguration cases with non-differentiable objectives. Two typical constraints are considered: final configuration constraints representing coupling variables and collision avoidance constraints representing coupling constraints, both of which are non-convex. General schemes are proposed to convexify those constraints via the linearization and convex restriction technology. Then final configuration constraints are tackled by primal decomposition, while collision avoidance constraints by dual decomposition. To the end, multi-level primal and dual decompositions are employed to solve reconfiguration problems with both coupling variables and coupling constraints. For illustration an example of in-plane cluster reconfiguration is solved and compared with the centralized approach the solution is optimal.},

 abstract = {The capital required to maintain infrastructure in good repair falls short globally. This is commonly referred to as the “infrastructure finance gap”. To address climate change, transitioning from conventional to sustainable infrastructure further imposes financing challenges. This study employs the Model approach to justify and predict how blockchain technologies can leverage infrastructure data to close the finance gap by introducing new financing mechanisms. A semisystematic literature review was carried out for infrastructure finance, sustainable infrastructure and smart cities finance mechanisms, as well as blockchains and oracles. Conventional infrastructure finance via debt and equity lacks benchmarks that reflect the risk-return characteristics of the asset class. Performance-based financing addresses this issue by integrating performance data in valuations. However, a lack of trust in data veracity remains. Blockchains provide trust and transparency in data and transactions. They utilize oracles to access off-chain information for on-chain decision-making. With smart contracts and decentralized oracle networks, a general approach is presented where data from internet-of-things inform on-chain transactions, delivering performance benchmarks that accurately reflect the risk-return characteristics in an infrastructure investment. Capital can then be more readily deployed, thus closing the finance gap. An end-to-end example of financing sustainable stormwater infrastructure, Open Storm, is also presented.},

 abstract = {The highly dynamic nature of future computing systems, where applications dynamically emerge as opportunistic aggregation of autonomous and independent resources available at any given time, requires a radical shift in the adopted computing paradigms. Indeed, they should fully reflect the decentralized perspective of the execution environment and consider QoS, scalability and resilience as key objectives. In this context, the everything-as-a-service (XaaS) paradigm, which envisions the creation of new services as an assembly of independent services available within the environment, can greatly help in tackling the challenges of developing future applications. However, in order to be effective, XaaS paradigm requires self-adaptive service assembly solutions able to cope with the unpredictable variability and scalability of the execution environment, the lack of global knowledge, and the QoS requirements of services to be built. We contribute in this direction by designing a fully decentralized and collective self-adaptive service assembly framework whose main features are: (i) self-assembly, i.e., the ability to operate autonomously, (ii) online-learning, i.e., the ability to dynamically learn from experience, (iii) QoS-awareness, i.e., the inclusion of QoS requirements as driving forces for self-assembly, (iv) scalability, i.e., the ability to cope with a large number of services, and (v) resilience, i.e., the ability to maintain the persistence of service delivery when facing unexpected changes (e.g., in the number and/or QoS of services). Simulation experiments show that our solution makes the system able to quickly converge to viable assemblies that improve and maintain over time the social welfare of the system, despite the local perspective of each participating service.},

 abstract = {Electricity generation is decentralising quickly. Simultaneously, final energy use for residential customers electrifies in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Together with ubiquitous digitalisation, this decentralisation and flexibility at the demand side paves the way towards local energy communities and in its most distributed version to peer-to-peer energy trading, where customers buy and sell electricity among each other. Although peer-to-peer energy trading is not yet legal everywhere, citizen energy communities have been introduced as cornerstones of the energy transition by the European Commission in their Clean Energy for All Europeans programme. This paper firstly discusses this digitalisation and decentralisation of the power infrastructure. These trends are supported by distributed information technologies, including peer-to-peer control paradigms. Distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchains, might be one such piece of the puzzle. The second part of the paper investigates whether blockchain technologies, and their associated smart contracts, offer advantages for larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications over a classic, centralised approach. Different blockchain implementations are investigated and qualitatively evaluated from a scalability, efficiency and trust perspective. The conclusion indicates that in the current state of the art, a trade-off between decentralised and more classical (hierarchically centralised) solutions suits larger-scale peer-to-peer energy-trading applications best.},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on the general problem of coordinating multiple robots, in particular, addresses the problem of the distribution of heterogeneous multi-task in a robust and efficient manner. The main interest in these systems is to understand how from simple rules inspired by the division of labor in social insects, a group of robots can perform tasks in an organized and coordinated way. We take into account a specifically distributed or decentralized approach as we are particularly interested in experimenting with truly autonomous and decentralized techniques in which the robots themselves are responsible for choosing a particular task in an autonomous and individual way. Under this approach we can speak of multi-task selection instead of multi-task assignment, which means, that the agents or robots select the tasks instead of being assigned a task by a central controller. In this regard, we have established an experimental scenario to solve the corresponding multi-task distribution problem and we propose a solution using different approaches by applying the response threshold models inspired by division of labor in social insects, the application of the reinforcement learning algorithm based on learning automata theory and ant colony optimization-based deterministic algorithms. We have evaluated the robustness of the algorithms, perturbing the number of pending loads to simulate the robot׳s error in estimating the real number of pending tasks and also the dynamic generation of loads through time. The paper ends with a critical discussion of experimental results.},

 abstract = {Data usage control enables data owners to enforce policies for their data, by defining authorizations, but also obligations, which are actions to be performed before, during or after being granted access such as accepting web cookies, and conditions bearing on the system and environment attributes, e.g., the time. Usage control is often coupled with information flow control to monitor how data are propagated. While usage control is well established and modeled in centralized systems, the literature has only partially addressed usage control for distributed systems, for instance by distributing the usage control system components. However, when it comes to assigning policy to certain data, it is always enforced by a central authority. This paper proposes an extended usage control model to integrate decentralized information flow control (DIFC), which enables users to decide collectively which policy to apply to their common data. Functions to handle connection status aspects are also considered, for dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) or peer-to-peer networks where parts of the distributed network can be disconnected. Architectural aspects and formal definitions to enable decentralized policies for shared data are proposed as a novelty, resulting from the integration of DIFC. We used the TLA+ formal specification language on the proposed model and its attached model checker TLC to detect potential issues. We detected potential deadlocks due to the new connection functions as well as temporal ordering issues then suggested mitigations accordingly. A privacy analysis is provided using a car-sharing scenario to highlight the benefits of usage control.},

Indeed, most of the user privacy issues related to the centralized Online Social Network (OSN) services (such as Facebook or Google+) do not apply in the case of DOSNs because of the absence of the centralized service provider. However, these new architectures have motivated researchers to investigate new privacy solutions that allow DOSN’s users to protect their contents by taking into account the decentralized nature of the DOSNs platform. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the privacy solutions adopted by currently available DOSNs, and we compare them by exploiting several criteria. After presenting the differences that existing DOSNs present in terms of provided services and architecture, we identify, for each of them, the privacy model used to define the privacy policies and the mechanisms for their management (i.e., initialization and modification of the privacy policy). In addition, we evaluate the overhead introduced by the security mechanisms adopted for privacy policy management and enforcement by discussing their advantages and drawbacks.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a new decentralized optimization-based approach for an aggregator involved in residential demand response programs. The proposed approach relies on an existing two-phase optimization framework, whereby prosumers optimize first their self-generation and household consumption, which are subsequently coordinated by the aggregator via incentives through the solution of a mixed-integer linear program. As a distinctive aspect, the notion of fairness in the distribution of incentives among prosumers is incorporated through new nonlinear constraints based on the Shapley Value while respecting standard demand response requirements. A mathematical approximation, which is proven to be exact under certain practical assumptions, is proposed to accommodate the new constraints into the linear model. Furthermore, a novel solution methodology, which combines the divide-and-conquer principle and Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition, is devised to tackle the resulting problem in a distributed fashion. For validation purposes, the behavior of the linear approximations is examined by comparing the results with those attained with their nonlinear counterparts. Moreover, scenarios for prosumers featuring different flexibility levels are generated to assess the practicality of the assumptions adopted. Simulations also show the scalability of the proposed tool by considering cases with up to 10,000 prosumers with computing times within an hour if distributed computing is implemented. Furthermore, as compared to classical Shapley Value approaches, a similar distribution of incentives is attained by the new solution methodology with relative less and acceptable computational effort. Finally, the impact of the new constraints on Peak-to-Average Ratio is quantified, obtaining an increment of up to 13.2% with respect to cases disregarding fairness.},

 abstract = {Digitalization will play a vital role in the achievement of successful transitions towards more flexible, reliable and sustainable energy systems. The progressive availability of data from meters and sensors deployed across end-users and energy supply-chains constitute a first step towards this direction. Leveraging on such cross-sectorial trend, business developers find in decentralized ledger technologies (DLTs) – such as the blockchain – opportunities for value creation across a broad range of participants in energy systems. Peer-to-peer energy trading platforms interconnect legacy and novel participants leveraging renewable and storage capacity (small and utility-scale) with grid operators and within local microgrids or markets. In this way, near real time (bi-directional) exchanges can be secured and validated via tokenization and smart contracting. The proposed configurations enable governance arrangements between legacy and novel participants at the platform and sectorial level. This paper focuses on investigating the decentralized governance characteristics proposed by peer-to-peer energy trading platforms and briefly discusses their implications on legacy systems from a broad ‘relational’ (i.e. actor network, sociotechnical transitions) and ‘normative’ (i.e. energy justice) set of theories. The paper draws upon prior surveys and publicly available whitepapers from business initiatives (start-ups). For the purposes of this study, whitepapers constitute official written texts and potential sources of information for the study of emergent ways of governance and collective action leveraging this technology. Results from ground theory method (qualitative) leveraging an inductive content analysis approach, built four (4) main categories that explain: (1) the digital features of these platforms, (2) the participants and incentives involved (3) the purposes and benefits of the solutions and, (4) the governance dynamics arising from trading tokenized energy via smart contracting. Results reveal complex multi-level socio-technical interrelations at different layers and points towards opportunities for private and community-based solutions, end-user empowerment, democratic energy systems and polycentric governance while considering fractal planning in policy design.},

 abstract = {Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new arising terminology of network architecture with outstanding features of orchestration by decoupling the control plane and the data plane in each network element. Even though it brings several benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the single point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down all network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can access to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation owing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the Northbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network topology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even worse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller. Hence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN’s Northbound. Furthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during data exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations, we introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized authentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to assist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With strict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for each request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing over-privileged activities or security policy conflicts. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we also implement a prototype of this framework to evaluate the security impact, effectiveness, and performance through typical use cases.},

Yet these aspects are not visited frequently by research activities.

 abstract = {This study addresses the question of how the electricity grid can best be priced, in the context of disruptive technologies, increasing decentralisation of the power sector and new business models. The emergence of business models can affect the design of tariffs, but at the same time, tariff design can trigger new business models as they can nudge adoption towards certain technologies. Network tariffs have traditionally been established using a cost accounting method. Due to its cost structure, network tariffs are second best constructs, as marginal cost pricing does not lead to cost recovery. Second best solutions, in all probability, will overcompensate some inputs which in turn will be overused (the Averch-Johnson effect). New distributed energy technologies that perform better in these overcompensated inputs will therefore see a higher penetration in the market. Penetration of some technologies over others in a previously monolithic vertically integrated power sector will open up new customer needs and therefore business opportunities. Each resulting business opportunity would make use of the grid differently from which it was originally conceived, and at one extreme, they can bypass it altogether. We provide a framework of analysis that leads to the pricing of the services provided by the electricity grid for each new business opportunity.},

After recent literature outlined a basic model of a biointelligent value creation system consisting of numerous on-site units, this paper introduces the concept of biointelligent Waste-to-X systems as a technological substantiation. A description of the system model as well as example technologies are presented in order to serve as a basis for their implementation.},

 abstract = {The Web 2.0 digital economy, centered on dominant platforms, generates substantial opportunities for managers and entrepreneurs yet creates critical dependencies. Platform-dependent businesses engage in competitive actions—rivalrous, competitive-cooperative, and relational—vis-à-vis digital platforms to gain a fair share of economic value. While the (supposedly) trustworthy custodians of digital data have captured a disproportionate share of revenue and profits, Web3 promises to tilt the balance away from dominant platforms by providing mechanisms that replace centralized organizational trust with decentralized technological trust. Here, innovations such as blockchains and smart contracts complement antitrust laws and regulations in limiting platform power. Furthermore, this study suggests that end users, peers, and regulators may play an important role in helping businesses draw investors’, users’, and customers’ attention away from Web 2.0 platforms. To effectively leverage decentralized trust as a novel aspect of competitive actions, business leaders must pursue Web3 technologies that are reliable, high-growth market segments that are credible, and ventures that are investable.},

 abstract = {Smart city projects stand out for including a wide array of communication systems and heterogeneous technologies operated by multiple entities that collect data from citizens in very different ways. Basically, these projects involve three main actors that may have conflicting interests regarding the ownership and exploitation of the generated data: public administrations, service providers and citizens. Nevertheless, this is not a new problem. Actually, the most popular communication systems on the Internet, such as social networks, often have issues of this kind that can become highly visible in the press, especially when service providers, who commonly store data generated by their users via centralized models, have a security issue leading to a massive data leak, or when providers take advantage of their dominant position to exploit data improperly or sell it to third parties. This paper proposes an architecture to create user-centric data management applications for communications in smart cities where data is stored and managed in a decentralized way to reduce dependency on service providers and return control of the data to the different actors involved in the communications. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed architecture is implemented, using Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as the main tools, to demonstrate its feasibility, show concrete protocols, and discuss the proposal on an empirical basis.},

In addition, rapid advancement of technology has enabled the bulk utilization of power generation units and energy storage (ES) systems in distribution networks. The next step in this trend is to decentralize ADSs to microgrids (MGs). This paper aims to present a review on the recent advancements in the development of ADSs and MGs. In this respect, the regulatory requirements and economic concepts, by which the traditional passive DNs are evolved into ADSs, are categorized and illustrated first. Then, the state-of-the-art of ADS formation is detailed based on the novel standpoint of grid operation factors which are involved in deregulated electricity markets at the distribution level. After presenting highlighted projects of MGs across the world, a similar review approach has been adopted to explain the formation of MGs which play a vital role in the decentralization of ADSs. This survey can provide both policy makers and distribution system planners with new perspectives to establish or participate in day-ahead wholesale markets.},

 abstract = {The requirement of large scale optimization of the power system environment brings out decentralized solutions in terms of applicability and economic feasibility, and trade relationship between prosumers at different power levels fed from the same point of common coupling point is important for a balanced economic profit. Moreover, ideal segmentation with a large scale participation is another economic issue in terms of allocation of total profit among aggregators. In this context, this study proposes a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market incorporating Multi-agent System (MAS) which consists different three agents with variable power levels. In the MAS environment, while Agent-1 represents a community which has variable household number according to the case studies, Agent-2 is an independent aggregator who is not included in, and does not influence the transactions of the Agent-1. Finally, Agent-3 is the ENKA Insaat ve Sanayi A.S. which has office buildings equipped with electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL) and photovoltaic (PV) panels. In the paper, all the agents simultaneously solve their own sub-problems by distributed way according to the received dynamic price signals along with the availability of the responsive demands. Moreover, 132 case studies consisting of low, medium, and large scale with different prosumer penetration are created in order to obtain optimal grouping strategy. The obtained results indicate that the group formation under middle penetrations gives the highest cost reductions, and the total cost reductions of Agent-1 and Agent-3 are 24.9% and 13.14%, respectively, while the total profit of Agent-2 is 4.53$ according to the best solution.},

Virtual capacity exchange platforms help to mitigate this challenge by exchanging capacities with anonymous participants in market-like peer-to-peer networks.

To leverage the potential of such exchange platforms, this paper reports on a Design Science Research project aiming to derive and validate design principles for establishing trust in inter-organizational capacity exchange in two design iterations. Using blockchain technology, we instantiate six design principles into an artifact and perform experimental evaluations to investigate their effect on perceived trust. Our paper contributes to research and practice by identifying and applying prescriptive design knowledge and advancing our understanding of how to design trust-enabling inter-organizational systems. The originality lies within the empirical investigation of how and why different design principle combinations can be established through blockchain technology as one of the promising approaches for establishing trust.

@article{GUI2014178,
 abstract = {In recent years the concept of “organization” has been gradually accepted as a suitable abstraction for the development of open multi-agent systems with dynamic agents. By modelling interactions based on roles, this abstraction allows an organization to be modelled independently of its participating agents so as to support agent dynamicity. A natural requirement from the abstraction is that agents need to be “organization aware”—that is they must be able to inquire, import, and execute roles from the organization. However, how to adequately support those processes in a decentralized and dynamic environment is still an open issue. This paper addresses this problem by presenting ATALK, a novel decentralized agent middleware that fulfills the above requirements. A role component model is designed to facilitate role deployment, reflection and uniform role interaction. In order to support role dynamicity, a compositional agent architecture allowing dynamic role integration and enactment is proposed. Moreover, ATALK allows agents to hand over their role to other agents of a same organization with their run-time states. Thus, agents can dynamically relinquish their roles without jeopardizing the normal execution of the organization. This paper also evaluates our design and current prototypic implementation through both qualitative analysis and simulations. Our results show that ATALK achieves remarkable organization reconfigurability with little additional overhead.},

 abstract = {The widespread diffusion of Online Social Networks has given unforeseen opportunities for their users to share contents and mutually interact. However, current platforms offer inadequate guarantees as far as concerns the privacy of their users. To address these issues and leave to the users more control on their data, several recent proposals suggest to decentralize the storage of social data, aiming at leaving their control entirely to their owners. This approach has lead to the definition of Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs), ranging from completely decentralized solutions, i.e. P2P solutions, to hybrid systems integrating external and private resources for storing user data. While DOSNs allow users to have more control over their data, they raise new challenges concerning the management and availability of social data. Guaranteeing data availability in a highly dynamic environment, defining proper algorithms for information diffusion and guaranteeing data privacy in a distributed setting are currently open problems in this area. This survey presents an overview of these challenges and of the main solutions presented in the literature. Existing proposals are classified taking into account the strategies adopted to manage social data, focusing on the data availability and on information diffusion. The survey also presents the new privacy issues arising in DOSNs. Finally, an overview of the main open issues in this research area is presented.},

Addressing this challenge, we introduce a pioneering decentralized path planning model, DPPDRL, built upon the foundations of deep reinforcement learning. Drawing inspiration from human path planning and dynamic coupling techniques, DPPDRL imbues AGVs with the autonomy to independently dictate and dynamically adapt their paths in real time. Notably, DPPDRL champions the adoption of diverse policies, thereby facilitating efficient collision avoidance and exploration of potential routes. Simulation-based evidence substantiates critical findings, including remarkable improvements in training speed and scalability, heightened adaptability to environmental variations and agent number changes, and applicability across any number of AGVs, provided a reasonable task distribution. However, DPPDRL's performance becomes limited when tasks are densely concentrated. Addressing this issue through task distribution and hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising direction for future research. These findings underscore the transformative potential of DPPDRL in managing extensive, dynamic AGV operations.},

This paper presents a universal framework for a blockchain platform that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in the retail electricity market. Focusing attention on seeking energy-matching pairs from the supply and demand sides, and encouraging direct energy trading between producers and consumers, the P2P energy trading mechanism is proposed. The designed multidimensional blockchain platform implements a complete energy trading process. As smart contracts strictly execute the trading and payment rules without human interaction, the security and fairness of energy trading are significantly enhanced. Case studies in the Ethereum private chain demonstrate that the proposed mechanism has obvious advantages in reflecting market quotations, balancing profits of players, and facilitating the utilization of renewables. Based on such characteristics, players are incentivized to participate in the P2P energy trading. Moreover, the authentic gas consumption and computational time to the smart contract indicate that this platform is able to achieve an efficient and effective transaction with multi-player participation.},

 abstract = {Previous indoor positioning research has mainly been focused on using Wi-Fi and RFID. In recent years, researchers began to study using Bluetooth 4.0 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for indoor positioning purposes. In general, positioning techniques based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI), such as signal propagation and fingerprint, are commonly used in wireless/mobile networks. These techniques have certain limitations and tradeoff in terms of accuracy, ease of implementation and practical application/deployment. For example, both methods require a training process before deployment. In this paper, we present a decentralized BLE-based positioning protocol that does not require training before deployment. The training process can automatically be done on the fly by the anchor nodes. While the anchor nodes are broadcasting, they also scan for signals emitted by other anchors. This collaborative communication process exchanges location information and signal strength measurements between each anchor. This process builds a signal-to-distance reference list for the target node to estimate physical distance in a more accurate way. Experimentation in a real indoor environment shows that the proposed collaborative positioning method can achieve an error of 1.5 meters on average. This is generally applicable for most indoor positioning applications for locating people. Furthermore, its implementation is simple and practical, because it does not require training before positioning estimation and is adaptive to environmental changes.},

 abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution has significantly increased the adoption of Digital Twins (DTs) across various sectors, including intelligent manufacturing, automation, logistics, and medical analysis. Despite substantial progress in deploying DT projects, numerous challenges remain, such as managing distributed data flows, protecting commercial confidentiality, securing intellectual property, and ensuring privacy and security. This research introduces a novel approach to addressing these challenges by leveraging blockchain and Web3 technologies, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The study aims to develop a distributed, tamper-proof DT cooperation platform that facilitates traceable and trustworthy data sharing while preserving intellectual property rights and enabling decentralized governance. This platform enhances idea and invention ownership, promotes collective decision-making through consensus protocols, and explores innovative solutions like blockchain-based federated learning and efficient DT project fundraising tools. Relying on security models and analysis tools, this study addresses several important security analysis methods/tools/models (e.g., random oracle model, BAN logic, AVISPA tool, and TAMARIN prover) that are known as practical analysis methods. They can strongly prove every claimed security feature of DT projects. The proposed solutions set the stage for future academic and industrial advancements, supported by a comprehensive SWOT (Strongness - Weakness - Opportunity - Threat) analysis, and outline potential future research directions.},

Several studies have measured the peer-to-peer (P2P) network decentralisation of Bitcoin and Ethereum (i.e., two of the largest used platforms). However, with the increasing demand for blockchain infrastructure, it is important to study node decentralisation across multiple blockchain networks, especially those containing a small number of nodes. In this paper, we propose NodeMaps, a data processing framework to capture, analyse, and visualise data from several popular P2P blockchain platforms, such as Cosmos, Stellar, Bitcoin, and Lightning Network. We compare and contrast the geographic distribution, the hosting provider diversity, and the software client variance in each of these platforms. Through our comparative analysis of node data, we found that Bitcoin and its Lightning Network Layer 2 protocol are widely decentralised P2P blockchain platforms, with the largest geographical reach and a high proportion of nodes operating on The Onion Router (TOR) privacy-focused network. Cosmos and Stellar blockchains have reduced node participation, with nodes predominantly operating in large cloud providers or well-known data centres.},

While previous literature on project delivery models identifies the use of decentralized governance, there is not yet a holistic conceptualization nor a specific overview of governance applications that can be applied. To develop the concept, we use a literature review to synthesize fourteen blockchain governance mechanisms useful for managing the crypto-commons. Subsequently, we use systematic combining to identify twenty-two specific applications for decentralized project delivery in the construction industry, one of the largest project-based industries. Each application is briefly reviewed, and examples of their relevance to realize decentralized project delivery models are provided. We discuss the potential for novel forms of project delivery, but also the need for future research on the applications, as well as on the system level implications, the system design challenges, and the implementation barriers in the specific context of the construction industry. Overall, the concepts and mechanisms presented provide a theoretical foundation upon which future researchers can use to design novel decentralized project delivery models.},

 abstract = {The world is undergoing a rapid energy transformation dominated by growing capacities of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. The intrinsic variable nature of such renewable energy sources calls for affordable energy storage solutions. This paper proposes using lifts and empty apartments in tall buildings to store energy. Lift Energy Storage Technology (LEST) is a gravitational-based storage solution. Energy is stored by lifting wet sand containers or other high-density materials, transported remotely in and out of the lift with autonomous trailer devices. The system requires empty spaces on the top and bottom of the building. An existing lift can be used to transport the containers from the lower apartments to the upper apartments to store energy and from the upper apartments to the lower apartments to generate electricity. The installed storage capacity cost is estimated at 21 to 128 USD/kWh, depending on the height of the building. LEST is particularly interesting for providing decentralized ancillary and energy storage services with daily to weekly energy storage cycles. The global potential for the technology is focused on large cities with high-rise buildings and is estimated to be around 30 to 300 GWh.},

 abstract = {The primary objective of implementing a demand response (DR) program is to actively involve participants in maximizing social welfare by effectively reducing electricity demand, optimizing cost savings, and facilitating peer-to-peer (P2P) trading of surplus power between prosumers and consumers residing within a community. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to optimize the scheduling of home-controlled appliances, minimize overall electricity costs of the community, and prioritize participants' privacy by integrating non-cooperative energy game theory under time-of-use (TOU) tariffs and incentive schemes. The proposed Segmentation Based Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (SBD-ADMM) is a novel algorithm that efficiently addresses the social welfare and participants' privacy problem in a decentralized distribution of power. It introduces a communication-efficient approach to optimize power trading while maximizing collective welfare, without relying on a central hub or authority. Node coloring is used in the formulation of the algorithm, in which every node just needs to trade with its neighbors in order to attain the entire optimum solutions. The suggested P2P trading algorithm is assessed on a broad range of scenarios, demonstrating its efficiency as well as fast convergence. The P2P trading algorithm provides similar optimum results with considerably a lesser number of communications and iterations as compared to other contemporary decentralized techniques. The suggested strategies for DR program and P2P trading are more feasible and privacy-preserving compared to other modern strategies. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that demand response and P2P trading can reduce overall costs for consumers by up to 30.23 % and for prosumers by up to 44.34 %.},

 abstract = {In the context of integrated water resources management implementation, the decentralization of water resources management (DWRM) at the river basin level is a crucial aspect for its success. However, decentralization requires the creation of new institutions on the ground, to stimulate an environment enabling stakeholder participation and integration into the water management decision-making process. In 1991, Mozambique began restructuring its water sector toward operational decentralized water resources management. Within this context of decentralization, new legal and institutional frameworks have been created, e.g., Regional Water Administrations (RWAs) and River Basin Committees. This paper identifies and analyzes the key institutional challenges and opportunities of DWRM implementation in Mozambique. The paper uses a critical social science research methodology for in-depth analysis of the roots of the constraining factors for the implementation of DWRM. The results obtained suggest that RWAs should be designed considering the specific geographic and infrastructural conditions of their jurisdictional areas and that priorities should be selected in their institutional capacity building strategies that match local realities. Furthermore, the results also indicate that RWAs have enjoyed limited support from basin stakeholders, mainly in basins with less hydraulic infrastructure, in securing water availability for their users and minimizing the effect of climate variability.},

Key Management (KM) is particularly a difficult security issue, mainly because of the lack of resources of the IoT devices. Most of the existing solutions do not consider the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the IoT. They do not regard the difference in capability of its components and impose equal loads on them. Moreover, they store keys in device memories before deployment, which makes adding devices difficult afterwards. We propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based KM protocol for the IoT. Our solution balances the loads between nodes according to their capabilities. We prove that this makes it efficient and scalable. Furthermore, our solution securely rekey the network upon a change. To decentralize the KM, we use the blockchain technology and smart contracts. We show that the system continues to operate when an entity fails and that the compromise of an entity does not jeopardize the whole network. We also prove that our solution fulfills the IoT requirements in terms of security and performance. Finally, we propose an implementation on IoT platforms to validate our theoretical analysis and simulation results.},

 abstract = {Small-scale data centers at the edge are becoming prominent in offering various services to the end-users following the cloud model while avoiding the high latency inherent to the classic cloud environments when accessed from remote Internet regions. However, we should address several challenges to facilitate the end-users finding and consuming the relevant services from the edge at the Internet scale. First, the scale and diversity of the edge hinder seamless access. Second, a framework where researchers openly share their services and data in a secured manner among themselves and with external consumers over the Internet does not exist. Third, the lack of a unified interface and trust across the service providers hinder their interchangeability in composing workflows by chaining the services. Thus, creating a workflow from the services deployed on the various edge nodes is presently impractical. This paper designs Viseu, a latency-aware blockchain framework to provide Virtual Internet Services at the Edge. Viseu aims to solve the puzzle of network service discovery at the edge, considering the peers’ reputation and latency when choosing the service instances. Viseu enables peers to share their computational resources, services, and data among each other in an untrusted environment, rather than relying on a set of trusted service providers. By composing workflows from the peers’ services, rather than confining them to the pre-established service provider and consumer roles, Viseu aims to facilitate scientific collaboration across the peers natively. Furthermore, by offering services from multiple peers close to the end-users, Viseu also minimizes end-to-end latency and data loss in the service execution at the Internet scale.},

Altitude proves to have decisive influence on energy optimization results, because it affects energy demand. The improvement of local energy systems provides greater socioeconomic benefits in mountainous settlements, due to the high shares of renewables and energy efficiency interventions in the optimal solutions. Energy poverty can be alleviated by redesigning local energy systems and the structure of the energy market. However, spatial and aesthetic restrictions, presented often in mountainous settlements, may affect the operational costs of energy systems, which is a crucial parameter for confronting energy poverty. Furthermore, the study indicates that it could be better to electrify remote areas, far from electricity grids, by decentralized systems than by grid expansion.

In-house efficacy of such systems has been greatly improved due to lean six-sigma methodologies; however, wider scale distribution and supply has undergone little to no transformation over the past century. Research pertaining to distributed manufacture, cloud-manufacture and reconfigurable systems have provided several decentralized models using traditional manufacturing capabilities. Due to practical limitations they have not been fully realized to date. This paper outlines the emerging concept and scope for hybrid manufacturing platforms – systems using a plurality of processes on a single motion platform, to manufacture products in a decentralized network. Necessity of on-machine inspection is highlighted, outlining the potential of generic artifact machine calibration and verification of parts made. A robust experimental method using a novel hybrid manufacturing approach is used to realize the post-process adaptation of subsequent parts and demonstrates significant improvement with adapted features being cut within 15μm of nominal position, compared to the original 300μm error. Social, economic and environmental ramifications of adopting such a system are highlighted. The combination of several key processes will allow users to manufacture parts with minimal intervention. A move to personal fabrication would allow greater customization and convenience for the end user; however, the issues of copyright and loss of economy of scale would inhibit mass uptake in the near-future. Growing interest by enthusiasts and early adopters will continue to make an impact on the way the populace views manufacture.},

Electrochemical biosensors have the potential to provide rapid and inexpensive diagnostics while moving clinical testing from centralized labs to point-of-care (POC) applications. Conductive materials functionalized with bioreceptors that remain stable and functional for measurements in real-world conditions are essential for the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors, and carbon-based nanomaterials provide the electrical, chemical, structural, and mechanical features that make them suitable for POC devices. This review details the most recent developments in the use of carbon-based nanostructures, with a focus on one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, two-dimensional graphene, and graphene oxide, their interface with biological receptors, deposition on portable, flexible, and wearable substrates, and integration on low-cost platforms for detection of clinical biomarkers. The large-scale manufacturing and implementation of microneedles as implantable and electronic tattoos as wearable devices for on-skin diagnostics, and lab-on-mouth platforms as well as the interface with mobile technologies and their potential implementation for remote POC monitoring and decentralized healthcare through cloud processing and the internet of things (IoT) are discussed with examples of applications. The review concludes with an overview of the regulatory perspectives and future trends, challenges, and opportunities for commercialization and translation of these technologies from the research lab to practice, as useful diagnostic tools for remote monitoring of patient health conditions.},

 abstract = {The progression in quantum computing and the rapid development of quantum computation hardware has raised expectations for its application to commercially relevant use cases in the future. However, the need for high-level quantum programming abstractions and targeted use cases paired with vertical applications, which can directly benefit from quantum computing, remains an open challenge. This paper presents our vision for a decentralized architecture for swarm based IoT systems that leverages a high-level continuous development and integration quantum programming suite to support edge processing capabilities for different use cases across the edge-fog-cloud continuum. The planned Quantum DevKit provides the necessary abstractions and low-level backend interfaces for quantum computing infrastructure, enabling edge computation using quantum processing, with extensions to efficient management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The paper focuses on the presentation of the development kit and its coupling swarm-based architecture that automates the orchestration of the cloud-to-edge continuum, showcasing the potential of quantum technology in edge processing.},

 abstract = {We consider a hard decentralized scheduling problem with heterogeneous machines and competing job sets that belong to different self-interested stakeholders (agents). The determination of a beneficial solution, i.e., a respective contract in terms of a common schedule, is particularly difficult due to information asymmetry and self-interested behavior of the involved agents. The agents intend to minimize their individual costs that consist of tardiness cost and their share of the machine operating cost. The aim of this study is to find socially beneficial outcomes by means of negotiation mechanisms that comply with decentralized information and conflicting interests. For this purpose, we present an automated negotiation protocol, which is inspired by metaheuristics, along with a set of optional building blocks. In the protocol, new solutions are iteratively generated, as mutations of a single provisional contract, and proposed to the agents, while feasible rules with quotas restrict the acceptance decisions of the agents. The computational experiments show that the protocol—without central information and subject to strategic behavior—can achieve high quality solutions which are very close to results from centralized multi-criteria procedures. Particular building block configurations yield improved outcomes. Concluding, the considered scheduling problem enhances standard scheduling models by incorporating multiple stakeholders, nonlinear cost functions, and machine operating cost, whereas the presented negotiation approach contributes to the methodology and practice of collaborative decision making.},

One of the solutions is to increase the influence of local society on the decision-making processes of municipalities. The aim of the research is to find out the role of local society groups – students, their parents and principals – in the decision-making process, and their influence on the development of decentralized general education. The opinions of different actor groups are compared in order to find out their attitude to the decentralization processes of general education promoted by the LEA, and analyse the possible factors that influence the actor groups in the administrative decision-making processes which are used in the development of the LEA's policy and strategies.Quantitative and qualitative data collection methods are used – polls and profound interviews. The approach of the actor network theory is used in the research, which gives an opportunity to create an actor network for the decentralization process of general education. The most important actor groups in the process of decentralization have been identified. The results of the research show that in order to achieve the goals of development of general education, it is necessary to estimate the optimal degree of decentralization of educational management. The results of the research also show that sociological research gives substantial support to the planning of the development of general education towards decentralization and the achievement of the set aims.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we consider leader–follower decentralized optimal control for a hexarotor group with one leader and large population followers. Our hexarotor is modeled based on the quaternion framework to resolve singularity of the rotation matrix represented by Euler angles, and has 6-DoF due to six tilted propellers, which allows to control its translation and attitude simultaneously. In our problem setup, the leader hexarotor is coupled with the follower hexarotors through the followers’ average behavior (mean field), and the followers are coupled with each other through their average behavior and the leader’s arbitrary control. By using the mean field Stackelberg game framework, we obtain a set of decentralized optimal controls for the leader and N follower hexarotors when N is arbitrarily large, where each control is a function of its local information. We show that the corresponding decentralized optimal controls constitute an ϵ-Stackelberg equilibrium for the leader and N followers, where ϵ → 0 as N → ∞. Through simulations with two different operating scenarios, we show that the leader–follower hexarotors follow their desired position and attitude references, and the followers are controlled by the leader while effectively tracking their approximated average behavior. Furthermore, we show the nonsingularity and 6-DoF control performance of the leader–follower hexarotor group due to the novel modeling technique of the hexarotor presented in the paper.},

Specifically, an individual vehicle is controlled only by its local noisy information measured from a local sensor in order to follow the average behavior (mean field) of the entire population while achieving the overall optimal control performance. We solve the partially-observed linear-quadratic mean field game to obtain decentralized optimal controls for two-wheeled vehicles. These controls are decentralized since they are functions of the local estimated state from the local Kalman filter. We show that the set of the decentralized optimal controls constitutes an ϵ-Nash equilibrium, where ϵ converges to zero as the number of vehicles becomes large. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through simulations and experiments with various operation scenarios for a large population of two-wheeled vehicles.},

 abstract = {Manufacturers are increasingly aware of the importance of system resilience against unexpected disruptive occurrences, such as the recent global Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical wars in Europe. Meanwhile, Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is recently envisioned as the Blockchain 3.0 stage, in which enabling DAO in the manufacturing domain could be a promising attempt and will lead to decentralized autonomous manufacturing. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts and decentralized applications have the characteristics of verifiability, decentralization, transparency, autonomy, and tamper-proofing, which can enable a mass individualization paradigm to realize the promising Industry 5.0 vision of resilience. DAO provides a probable manner to regulate cross-prosumer activities under the Industry 5.0 context. Inspired by this vision, our paper reviews the literature on Decentralized Manufacturing (DM) and Autonomous Manufacturing (AM). Then, these two streams of efforts are unified, and a manufacturing paradigm, named Decentralized Autonomous Manufacturing (DAM), is defined towards resilience in Industry 5.0. In this paper, a reference architecture of the DAM is given. Followed by a comprehensive investigation of the key enablers, challenges, and barriers in the implementation of DAM, based on the insights from this analysis, future research directions of DAM are highlighted. We believe that our effort can lay a foundation for positioning DAM in futuristic Industry 5.0 research and engineering practice.},

Therefore, there is an increasing need for evaluating the adaptive capacities of communities, regions or even whole countries to events caused by climatic changes. In this work we address different methodologies for this purpose and give reasons for adopting the adaptive capacities wheel developed by Gupta et al. [1] as the basic way for this evaluation. We add an additional dimension to those already developed by Gupta for determining the capacity of a community for having basic services (health, communications, safety, etc.) in a situation of crisis caused by climatic changes. A climatic crisis generally affects the conventional energy infra-structure and therefore decentralized renewable energies would reduce vulnerability of the community in question. At the end we discuss the evaluation made under these assumptions for a selected community in Mexico.},

 abstract = {While project crashing is a prominent practice in project management and can be approached by the well-known time–cost tradeoff problem (TCTP), the existing methodologies assume a centralized decision paradigm. In this paper, we study a new decentralized multi-project time-cost tradeoff problem, called MPTCTP-D, where project scheduling and resource allocation decisions are made in a distributed way by autonomous project managers to optimize their local objective, subject to a global available budget for all the projects. We show and prove the existence of price of anarchy as the difference between the optimal objective value of MPTCTP-D and its centralized counterpart. A multi-agent based cooperative approach with negotiation protocol is proposed to mitigate resource competition of autonomous local decisions and achieve a reasonable allocation of resource for global decision-maker, with both exact and local-search based heuristic algorithms developed. Our exact algorithm is able to find optimal solutions and prove optimality for instances with up to five projects and 120 activities per project. The hybrid randomized and 2-opt improvement algorithm is able to efficiently find optimal solutions to small instances and significantly better solutions than other heuristics alone for instances with up to 20 projects and 120 activities per project. Managerial insights on the optimal solutions and the price of anarchy are obtained and discussed.},

 abstract = {In large cities with harbors or rivers, ferry services have been an important part of public transport. In practice, many ferry terminals are subject to geographical and environmental conditions, limited space resources of the terminal pool, and restricted navigable waters of ships, which leads to constrained operations and increases the difficulty of docking when multiple ferries enter and depart from the terminal. Because of the distributed, real-time and dynamic characteristics of multi-ferry maneuvering, this paper proposes a decentralized, time-optimal control strategy to coordinate the maneuvering of multiple entering and departing ferries in restricted terminals. It combines nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) with an iterative learning control (ILC) framework. Based on the states and maneuver data of previously successfully performed trajectories, the coupled constraints among multiple ferries are decomposed with support vector machine (SVM). Therefore, it also does not require real-time information exchange during ferry operations and has the merits of low communication demand, as only local information is required in each ferry controller. Simulations are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, the dominant model of corporate governance often concentrates power among a limited group of directors, leading to concerns about potential power imbalances that may distort fair representation and compromise decision-making integrity. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) present an alternative model that distributes power among a broader base of stakeholders, fostering a more democratic approach to collective decision making and governance. However, the openness and fluidity inherent in DAOs can expose them to coordination challenges, governance complexities, and potential exploitation by malicious entities. In response to possible governance challenges, we consider DAOs as digital commons and adapt Ostrom's eight principles for governing the commons to propose a new governance framework for DAOs. This governance framework is designed to foster the collective stewardship of shared digital assets and the equitable distribution of decision-making authority in the Web3 era. As DAOs emerge as a novel organizational structure, our governance framework aims to maintain their resilience, inclusiveness, and decentralization, reinforcing their crucial role in the evolving Web3 landscape.},

 abstract = {The fast deployment of distributed energy resources in the electric power system has highlighted the need for an efficient energy trading transactive model, without the need for centralized dispatch. In this field, a particular challenge is the determination of an effective pricing scheme that is able to produce benefits for all participants. In this paper, a novel dynamic pricing methodology is presented, offering a market-oriented means to drive decentralized energy trading and to optimize financial benefits for owners of distributed energy resources. Firstly, a price-responsive model for each type of distributed energy resource is investigated. Particularly, the decoupled State of Charge function is proposed to calculate the value of a single charging/discharging action for energy storage systems. In addition, an adaptable three-tiered framework is designed, including micro-grid balancing, aggregator scheduling, and trading optimization. By launching Tier I, II, and III, the spot prices for participants are iteratively updated and optimized in inner-micro-grid, inner-aggregator, and inter-aggregators level. The framework is able to maximize the financial savings from renewable energy, and meanwhile, provide a dynamic price signal to assist stakeholders in determining response actions and trading strategies. A realistic case is simulated using Java Agent Development framework based multi-agent modeling. The results indicate that the presented methodology enables decentralized energy trading and permits easier marketization of micro-grids with a high share of distributed energy resources.},

 abstract = {The rise of blockchain technology has brought innovations in various business domains and spawned a new form of organization—the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Steemit is recognized as one of the earliest blockchain-based online communities, and a typical example of DAO. By endowing community members with new roles, the decentralization of blockchain-based communities brings changes to the design of user incentive mechanisms. However, few studies have paid attention to the user incentive mechanism when users play the dual roles of social participant and community owner. On the basis of social capital theory and psychological ownership theory, this study explores Steemit's incentive mechanism by evaluating the impact of these dual roles on user active participation behavior. The study adopts a two-way fixed effect negative binomial regression to test the research model. The results show that users’ social capital, share capital, social feedback, and economic feedback positively affect their active participation behavior. At the same time, social feedback and economic feedback play moderating roles on the effects of the dual capitals. Overall, this research provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for understanding, designing, and governing blockchain-based online communities.},

 abstract = {Traditional power grids, being highly centralized in terms of generation, economy, and operation, continually employed probabilistic methods to account for load uncertainties. In modern smart grids (SG), rapid proliferation of non-dispatchable generation (physical decentralization) and liberal markets (market decentralization) leads to dismantling of the centralized paradigm, with operation being performed by several decentralized agents. Handling uncertainty in this new paradigm is aggravated due to 1) a vastly increased number of uncertainty sources, and 2) decentralized agents only having access to local data and limited information on other parts of the grid. A major problem identified in modern and future SGs is the need for fully decentralized optimal operation techniques that are computationally efficient, highly accurate, and do not jeopardize data privacy and security of individual agents. Machine learning (ML) techniques, being successors to traditional probabilistic methods are identified as a solution to this problem. In this paper, a conceptual model is constructed for the transition from a fully centralized operation of a SG to a decentralized one, proposing the transition scheme between the two paradigms. A novel ML algorithm for fully decentralized operation is proposed, formulated, implemented, and tested. The proposed algorithm relies solely on local historical data for local agents to accurately predict their optimal control actions without knowledge of the physical system model or access to historical data of other agents. The capability of cloud-based cooperative information exchange was augmented through a new concept of s-index activation codes, being encoded vectors shared between agents to improve their operation without sharing raw information. The algorithm is tested on a modified IEEE 24-bus test system and synthetically generating historical data based on typical load profiles. A week-ahead high-resolution (15-minute) fully decentralized operation case is tested. The algorithm is shown to guarantee less than 0.1% error compared to a centralized solution and to outperform a neural network (NN). The algorithm is exceptionally accurate while being highly computationally efficient and has great potential as a versatile model for fully decentralized operation of SGs.},

 abstract = {Traditional centralized token exchange (CEX) has been suffering from hacking due to the centralized management of users’ tokens. In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) maintains users’ assets by smart contracts in a decentralized manner, but introduces additional overhead in terms of gas fee and transaction confirmation latency. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the benefits of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is criticized for two issues. First, trading transactions are time-consuming and expensive for frequent token traders. Second, excessive simultaneous transactions might cause the pending transaction congestion in the Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate the pending transaction congestion. Besides, we propose the very first gas-price vs. transaction-confirmation-latency function to guide Ethereum transaction issuers to choose an optimal gas price that minimizes the overall cost. Extensive simulations are conducted to compare the cost in the proposed HEX with that in the conventional HEX. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism in terms of reducing gas fees and transaction confirmation latency for frequent traders as well as the pending transaction congestion in Ethereum.},

 abstract = {The ability of sociotechnical systems to recover from disruptions through decentralized, bottom-up processes is a crucial element of their overall resilience, but it is also among the most overlooked in resilience research. This paper proposes a computational framework leveraging dynamic multi-agent networks to conceptualize, model, and quantify multi-agent, decentralized recovery process building upon strategic network formation methods. This innovative approach addresses limitations in conventional strategic network formation models by accounting for the fluidity of structural shifts induced by the strategic behaviors of individual agents, and by acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity within agent populations. The central objective of this study is to highlight the critical role of bottom-up recovery and present a systematic, adaptable framework for modeling these processes in diverse real-world scenarios. We achieve this through four key elements: modeling post-disruption responses, exploring their interdependencies, accommodating multiple equilibria, and generating metrics for scenario comparison and forecasting. Our dynamic strategic network formation model offers valuable insights into crucial trade-offs in decentralized recovery processes and facilitates the integration of both bottom-up and top-down resilience strategies. Furthermore, it could serve as a predictive tool informing initial network architectural decisions by estimating likely post-disruption equilibrium states based on the initial network structure. Ultimately, this study provides a robust platform for analyzing network efficiency and resilience trade-offs, setting the stage for more informed decision-making in complex sociotechnical systems.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a widely deployed technology to provide innovative services in many several fields such as industry, logistics, healthcare, and energy management. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge/cloud computing, 5G networks, big data analytics, and other emerging technologies in IoT systems is leading to the emergence of Smart Systems that support devices to make autonomous decisions in order to improve and facilitate people’s lives. These smart IoT devices produce a huge amount of sensitive data. Thus, establishing Trust between these devices is vital to ensure the security of the sensed data and for the normal functionality of smart systems. To address these challenges, several Trust establishment protocols have been proposed, but they have some limitations such as centralization, the need for human intervention, and the lack of adaptability to smart devices with computation and storage constraints. In this paper, a decentralized trust establishment protocol is proposed for smart IoT devices and is applicable for different scenarios. The protocol provides decentralized identity management, mutual authentication, access control, and secure communication by combining Blockchain technology with PV-SAS-MCA message cross-authentication protocol based on Short Authenticated Strings (SAS). To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to propose a new approach that uses Blockchain as an extra distributed and authenticated channel to exchange Short Authenticated Strings without physical interaction. This helps to allow entities in the Smart IoT environment not only to identify each other but also to exchange their public keys in a secure manner. Moreover, the proposed protocol uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure communications with significantly smaller key sizes and lower computation overhead. Experimental results reveal that the time required to complete the authentication process is less than 90 ms which is a superior performance when compared to state-of-the-art decentralized authentication mechanisms.},

We present a complete analytical solution of these decentralized problems and derive conditions under which feasible solutions satisfying all safety constraints always exist. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is illustrated through simulation which shows substantial dual benefits of the proposed decentralized framework by allowing CAVs to conserve momentum and fuel while also improving travel time.},

The idea consists of considering the system of group of robots as a robot network with decentralized architecture. Each robot plans its trajectory according to its actual position, the position of the other neighbor robots, the position of the obstacles and the position of its target point. So each robot should interact with the other robots in the network to cooperate together in order to plan each robot trajectory. The path planning for every robot is planned based on the potential field approach. The network reacts with the changes of workspace in real time by updating the system equations associated for each robot. The main objective of this work is to avoid collision between robots and obstacles in order to ensure the safety of robots.

In this article, a multi-sensor multi-vehicle Cooperative Positioning System (CPS) is presented, with a hybrid fault detection method under a decentralized architecture, and that is tolerant to simultaneous sensor faults. In order to detect and isolate faults, a set of fault sensitive residuals are generated based on the divergence of Jensen Shannon (DJS) between the probability distributions predicted by the encoder based evolution model and the various observations obtained by sensors. Then, in order to detect a fault, a data-driven approach is applied, where the classification of faults is done by a pre-trained detection decision tree (D-DT) and isolation random forest (I-RF). The testing and evaluation of the approach is done on real data from three Turtlebot3 burger robot equipped with wheel encoders (for prediction), a gyroscope (for the yaw angle) and a Marvelmind (for the absolute position).

Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs) in Ghana, a form of forest decentralization, is a relatively recent government strategy to reduce forest loss, promote restoration, and improve local control and participation in resource management. This paper examines the powers devolved to CREMAs in Ghana, using a political ecology lens. Using a variety of qualitative research methods, the paper found that CREMAs receive limited powers from the State and these powers mainly restrict local access to resources, an action the State has often failed at. The results also suggest that CREMAs impose responsibility on local people without accompanying resources and often at the expense of security and safety of local volunteer enforcers. The findings also highlight the lack of coherence between forest decentralization and exiting political decentralization processes; the incoherence between the different institutional regulations for CREMAs; and tensions between new and traditional forms of local resource governance. The study suggests that critical approaches to evaluating the performance of decentralized regimes could be a useful approach to understanding the drivers of vulnerability among local resource users, dependents, and their institutions.},

 abstract = {The importance of moving towards sustainable energy systems is critical to achieving societal sustainability. Transitions theory is a useful approach to look at the potential and limitations of systemic transitions, and has been applied in a number of alternative contexts. In the current study, we examine transitions theory and its implications for the progress of decentralized energy systems in Japan in the period after the Fukushima accident of 2011. Empirical data from a targeted nation-wide survey is used to examine the progress and change in consumer preference and behavior since the disaster, as possible evidence for the potential transition paths likely to be occurring. Importantly, this study utilizes data that examines a spectrum of urban–rural and disaster–non-disaster areas in order to explore whether any differences in response patterns were present. Results indicate that although the desire of stakeholders has been to change the energy system, there are barriers to transformation. Variation between rural and urban sites and between disaster-affected and unaffected areas was examined, indicating that (at least under the chosen classification) there was surprisingly little difference. The results have implications for understanding transitions at a much broader level, and imply that, if the empirical data is a useful indicator, Japan is within a locked-in or reorganization transition. In order to move to a more radical conversion type change a new approach is likely to be required to nurture niche innovations effectively.},

 abstract = {Decentralization of fisheries management in Mexico has created overlapping state agencies without clearly defined responsibilities. This has generated a management dilemma for national fisheries enforcement, due to ambiguity in implementation and legislation among agencies. Through a case study in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve, in the Yucatan Peninsula, we explore how local actors have addressed problems resulting from the implementation of these decentralized policies. We focus on local Community Surveillance Committees to understand how cooperation occurs at the local level to enforce fisheries regulations. Through a systematic review of fisheries policies in Mexico, we describe the political context to understand the implications of decentralization. The first author conducted ethnographic fieldwork from 2013 to 2017 in three fishing communities and attended meetings with actors involved in local fisheries management. As part of fieldwork, 42 in-depth interviews with fishers and representatives from state agencies were conducted. Using a polycentric approach, we look beyond the performance of individual fishing cooperatives to focus on the relationships among governance actors. We found factors strengthening the Sian Ka'an surveillance system are local actors' capacity to create rules, their relative autonomy from the government, and the existence of more than one decision-making center. We highlight that ambiguity in the implementation of decentralization also enabled local actors to be innovative and fill gaps in the national fisheries policies enforcement system, through diverse configurations of institutional arrangements. In this case study, those arrangements are the result of a constant process of social innovation and improvement in the fishery's organization.},

First, for a leaderless team of homogeneous space robots transporting a large object in orbit, a systematic control architecture that includes information flow is developed. Second, based on relative orbit dynamics, a rendezvous guidance law and a rigid formation control law are designed, and the necessary communication topology for the space robot team is discussed. Third, to guarantee the consensus of the motion of the large object with the robot team, both orbital maneuver control and attitude control for the large object are studied Emphasis is placed not on the attitude control law but on the force distribution problem, for which an algorithm exploiting a special property of trigonometric functions is proposed to transfer the necessary attitude control torque to the distributed forces. To support the above control method, an estimation of the motion of the formation center contributed by each robot in a decentralized manner is developed using a Kalman filter. Fourth, the robustness of the system to the failure of one robot is analyzed, and four effective typical fault response modes are proposed. Finally, numerical simulations validated the performance, robustness and practicability of the developed control scheme.},

However, the outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted this practice, forcing universities to prioritize the safety of individuals during exams. In response, a shift to online assessments occurred, bringing forth new challenges such as academic dishonesty and inadequate infrastructure. This study presents a novel approach to decentralized in-person exams for geographically dispersed students. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed, followed by a mixed-integer linear reformulation, to optimally determine the scheduling of exams, test center locations, and student allocation, while addressing the incorporation of both hard and soft constraints. Given the complexity of the problem, we have implemented meta-heuristic algorithms to solve larger instances, including genetic and simulated-annealing algorithms. Additionally, we have devised a hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of population-based and local-search algorithms. For evaluation purposes, we used real data collected from our department during the fall semester of 2022. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the hybrid algorithm compared to others, in terms of both effectiveness and adaptability. It remains consistent across different scenarios, effectively addressing real-world complexities. Finally, a comparison between centralized and decentralized scenarios underscores the advantages of the latter approach during the pandemic.},

Applying MAPAF to analyze outputs and outcomes from two major decentralized forest policies in Ethiopia, i.e., delegation and devolution, has demonstrated the following strengths of the framework. First, by incorporating vital bundles of property rights into APAF, MAPAF creates a common ground for exploring and comparing the extent of democratization achieved by different decentralizing reforms. Second, the inclusion of social and environmental outcomes in MAPAF makes it possible to link the output of decentralization with local level outcomes. Finally, the addition of contextual factors enhances MAPAF's explanatory power by providing room for investigating exogenous factors other than democratization that contribute to the outcomes of decentralization reforms.},

This uneven playing field has a high potential to lead to inequitable circumstances with negative implications for humanity. Furthermore, the potential of AI is hindered by the lack of interoperability standards. The authors herein propose an alternative path for the development of AI: a distributed, decentralized, and democratized market for AIs run on distributed ledger technology. We describe the features and ethical advantages of such a system using SingularityNET, a watershed project being developed by Ben Goertzel and colleagues, as a case study. We argue that decentralizing AI opens the doors for a more equitable development of AI and AGI. It will also create the infrastructure for coordinated action between AIs that will significantly facilitate the evolution of AI into true AGI that is both highly capable and beneficial for humanity and beyond.},

 abstract = {With the rapid growth of big data, the applications of intellectual property (IP) rights and prior art documents are increasing rapidly. Patent examiners are usually overworked to evaluate inventions referring to a large volume of prior arts in a short period. Such increasing workloads and documents may cause administrative inefficiencies and generate low-quality IPs that hamper technological innovation. Moreover, today's centralized IP administration system is inefficient in processing speed, security, and cost. Inefficiencies of IP administration in each national IP office impede speedy and efficient cooperation for international application and registration. This study proposes an IP decentralized ledger (IP dLedger) based on the blockchain to significantly reduce IP administration costs and improve IP use. IP dLedger connects the on-chain (blockchain) to the off-chain (centralized database) systems using IP codes that combine hash values and timestamps. Similar to the web hypertext method, this connective feature of IP dLedger enables users who click on identification information registered in a blockchain network to access, through a hyperlink, a centralized database of enormous volumes of related IP information. Therefore, IP dLedger can reduce IP administration costs, increase IP usage, and facilitate safe and convenient use of the IP data.},

@article{NASINI2024,
 abstract = {Decentralized (parent-affiliates) business groups encompass independent firms sharing production resources under common administrative or financial control. Due to the complexity of integrated decision-making, business groups often delegate pricing and technology decisions to separated units. With the growing prevalence of transfer technology in multi-plant operations, there arises a demand for modeling frameworks capturing the joint impact of transfer prices and technology on affiliates’ production. In this paper, we propose an operational methodology to integrate transfer prices and technology, as incentive mechanisms driving affiliates’ production decisions. This consists of a single-leader-multi-follower game where a parent firm (the leader) operates in a single-product market and delegates production to profit-maximizing affiliate firms (the followers). In addition to providing data-driven support for integrated decision-making, our framework reveals how managerial structures respond to the growing significance of intangible technology. In this line, based on the parent’s control of the value chain we present two specifications and solution approaches: full delegation and partial delegation. For the former, we provide an exact characterization of the equilibrium solution; whereas for business groups operating under full delegation, we provide tight lower and upper bounds, computable by state-of-the-art optimization solvers. Our empirical tests rely on a customized version of the Orbis data set. Figures show that our methodology not only integrates the substitutability between transfer prices and technology, as well as their dependency on the parent’s control of the value chain, but also gives rise to a flexible computational approach that is applicable to a wide range of decentralized business groups.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, modern automotive systems include a great number of Electronic Control Units (ECUs). These ECUs provide many sophisticated systems such as engine control, antilock braking systems, etc. This fact has increased the automotive embedded networks complexity. Another important issue in this field is the necessity to define a suitable diagnosis strategy to prevent faults propagation. The integration of diagnosis functions into the automotive embedded systems contributes to overload the communication protocols. In this context, solutions for checking latencies entailed by extra-data traffic are urgently needed. Throughout this paper, a novel approach for the automotive diagnosis design, which is based on the Controller Area Network (CAN) analysis, is detailed. The principal contribution of this work consists in developing a decentralized fault diagnosis and studying its data traffic effect on messages deadlines. Our novel method, “CAN real-time analysis based on decentralized fault diagnosis”, is a step ahead to a reliable early phase automotive design. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is applied on a model of an advanced anti-crash system. The proposed design methodology presents several advantages. It optimizes the schedulability of tasks and facilitates the design validation. Moreover, a realistic hardware-in-the-loop simulation is carried out to validate our work.},

 abstract = {Routing in open and decentralized networks relies on cooperation. However, the participation of unknown nodes and node administrators pursuing heterogeneous trust and security goals is a challenge. Community-mesh networks are good examples of such environments due to their open structure, decentralized management, and ownership. As a result, existing community networks are vulnerable to various attacks and are seriously challenged by the obligation to find consensus on the trustability of participants within an increasing user size and diversity. We propose a practical and novel solution enabling a secured but decentralized trust management. This work presents the design and analysis of securely-entrusted multi-topology routing (SEMTOR), a set of routing-protocol mechanisms that enable the cryptographically secured negotiation and establishment of concurrent and individually trusted routing topologies for infrastructure-less networks without relying on any central management. The proposed mechanisms have been implemented, tested, and evaluated for their correctness and performance to exclude non-trusted nodes from the network. Respective safety and liveness properties that are guaranteed by our protocol have been identified and proven with formal reasoning. Benchmarking results, based on our implementation as part of the BMX7 routing protocol and tested on real and minimal (OpenWRT, 10 Euro) routers, qualify the behaviour, performance, and scalability of our approach, supporting networks with hundreds of nodes despite the use of strong asymmetric cryptography.},

 abstract = {The rise in distributed renewable generation and active prosumers has heightened power exchanges in Distribution Systems (DS), causing congestion issues. This paper presents a four-layer optimization model for Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to efficiently manage network congestion through smart prosumers. The first two layers involve an iterative bidding process in the energy market to maximize social welfare during settlement. The third and fourth layers address congestion in the market, employing an adaptive Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for decentralized coordination between DSOs and smart prosumers, including Microgrids (MGs), Energy Hubs (EHs), and Electric Vehicle Parking lots (EVPLs). Layer 1 optimizes market player bids, layer 2 maximizes social welfare, layer 3 handles congestion using various strategies, and layer 4 reschedules smart prosumers based on DSO's requests. Implemented on a 118-bus DS in GAMS, the model demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed adaptive ADMM in ensuring player privacy and market efficiency. Additionally, integrating the market-based mechanism with Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration (DFR) optimally utilizes smart prosumers, resulting in a 46.85% reduction in net DSO costs. This practical implication underscores the model's effectiveness in addressing network congestion challenges and providing economic benefits for DSOs.},

 abstract = {The flexibility of the power-to-gas (P2G) technologies and natural gas units (NGUs) can enhance the resilience of the electric distribution system (EDS) considering the high penetration of renewable energy resources (RERs). The decentralized collaborative operation (co-operation) of electric distribution systems and natural gas systems (EDSs&NGSs) considering information privacy preserving can enhance the resilience during an extreme hurricane. To address this issue, this paper proposes a three-level hierarchal solution to decompose the centralized co-operation of the EDS&NGS framework in which an independent decision-making strategy and information privacy preserving for both network operators are simultaneously addressed. Furthermore, in this paper, a min–max robust resilience-constrained co-optimization model is presented to enhance the resilience of the integrated EDS&NGS against worst-case N−kcontingencies and wind power generation uncertainty under extreme hurricane events. To attain the spatial dynamics of extreme hurricanes, a the multi-zone and multi-time extreme hurricanes model is considered. Then, a column-and-constraints generation (C&CG) algorithm is used to solve the proposed robust resilience-constrained co-optimization model. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we conducted experiments on a modified IEEE-33-bus-10-node/123-bus-20-node EDS&NGS. The numerical results show that the proposed robust resilience-constrained co-operation of EDS&NGS problem is an effective model for enhancing EDS resilience.},

An often encountered problem in the fusion process relates to unknown common information that is shared by the estimates to be fused and is responsible for correlations. If the correlation structure is unknown to the fusion method, conservative strategies are typically pursued. As such, the parameterization introduced by the ellipsoidal intersection method has been a novel approach to describe unknown correlations, though suitable values for these parameters with proven consistency have not been identified yet. In this article, an extension of ellipsoidal intersection is proposed that guarantees consistent fusion results in the presence of unknown common information. The bound used by the novel approach corresponds to computing an outer ellipsoidal bound on the intersection of inverse covariance ellipsoids. As a major advantage of this inverse covariance intersection method, fusion results prove to be more accurate than those provided by the well-known covariance intersection method.},

 abstract = {Airline disruption management traditionally seeks to address three problem dimensions: aircraft scheduling, crew scheduling, and passenger scheduling, in that order. However, current efforts have, at most, only addressed the first two problem dimensions concurrently and do not account for the propagative effects that uncertain scheduling outcomes in one dimension can have on another dimension. In addition, existing approaches for airline disruption management include human specialists who decide on necessary corrective actions for airline schedule disruptions on the day of operation. However, human specialists are limited in their ability to process copious amounts of information imperative for making robust decisions that simultaneously address all problem dimensions during disruption management. Therefore, there is a need to augment the decision-making capabilities of a human specialist with quantitative and qualitative tools that can rationalize complex interactions amongst all dimensions in airline disruption management, and provide objective insights to the specialists in the airline operations control center. To that effect, we provide a discussion and demonstration of an agnostic and systematic paradigm for enabling expeditious simultaneously-integrated recovery of all problem dimensions during airline disruption management, through an intelligent multi-agent system that employs principles from artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technology. Results indicate that our paradigm for simultaneously-integrated recovery executes in polynomial time and is effective when all the flights in the airline route network are disrupted.},

In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions—transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement—, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.},

Each subcontroller uses state feedback from adjacent subsystem sensors to perform vibration suppression and energy harvesting using a switching control law. Furthermore, the assumption is made that neighbouring subcontrollers exchange information collaboratively to estimate the effects of coupling forces, achieving control efficiency comparable to that of a centralized approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a modular suspension platform equipped with semi-active dampers and electromagnetic energy harvesters. The approach is evaluated under various free vibration scenarios, encompassing faulty measurement conditions, and is compared to passive and heuristic state-feedback control strategies.

However, when the required sensing becomes spatio-temporally large and varying, a collective arrangement of sensing tasks to a large number of battery-restricted and distributed drones is challenging. To address this problem, this paper introduces a scalable and energy-aware model for planning and coordination of spatio-temporal sensing. The coordination model is built upon a decentralized multi-agent collective learning algorithm (EPOS) to ensure scalability, resilience, and flexibility that existing approaches lack of. Experimental results illustrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. Analytical results contribute a deeper understanding of how coordinated mobility of drones influences sensing performance. This novel coordination solution is applied to traffic monitoring using real-world data to demonstrate a 46.45% more accurate and 2.88% more efficient detection of vehicles as the number of drones become a scarce resource.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a novel decentralized-distributed (DD) adaptive robust optimization (ARO) method to address the efficient distributed scheduling of multi-microgrid systems involving various entities, uncertainties and accidental communication failures. To avoid an unavailable coordination center of the whole network, a DD-ARO model is firstly proposed based on the parallelizing-distributed (PD) framework, which allocates the task of tie-line power coordination in the virtual center to the neighboring stakeholders. According to the properties of nonlinear ARO, a modified analytical target cascading method is further developed to formulate the consistency constraints on shared tie-lines, thus guaranteeing the optimality and enhancing the solution quality of the DD-ARO model. Finally, an iterative solution algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the resulting multi-level non-convex DD-ARO model. Case studies and computational results illustrate the effectiveness of the DD-ARO approach for an AC/DC hybrid multi-microgrid system under normal and faulty communications.},

 abstract = {A robust, decentralized, and real-time power management system is proposed by taking into account the economic dispatch constraints, overhead transmission lines reduction, and self-healing failure's mechanisms. Designed state of the art model is applicable to all the sectors of electricity consumers (residential, commercial, and industrial), utility companies and the power grid. Paramount importance is given to microgrids (MGs), while both of its modes (isolated and grid connected) are analyzed to examine the features of economic dispatch and system's net revenue in our prototypic. To deal with uncertainty in the demand curves, an innovative approach is adopted for the classification of electric load, according to their physical characteristics and user preferences. Furthermore, electricity generation is predominantly dependent on renewable energy sources (RESs), facilitated with the energy storage systems (ESSs); optimal scheduling methodology for power is introduced to tackle its intrinsically stochastic nature. Our problem minimizes the power system's aggregated cost with respect to power generation, consumption, and worst case transaction costs. Subgradient method is applied to solve our optimization problem, while lagrangian dual decomposition is used to transform the problem into subproblem for the accomplishment of all the objectives in distributed manners. For the corroboration of our strategy, results are reported after extensive numerical analysis.},

 abstract = {Developing countries constantly face the challenge of reliably matching electricity supply to increasing consumer demand. The traditional policy decisions of increasing supply and reducing demand centrally, by building new power plants and/or load shedding, have been insufficient. Locally installed microgrids along with consumer demand response can be suitable decentralized options to augment the centralized grid based systems and plug the demand–supply gap. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) develop a framework to identify the appropriate decentralized energy options for demand–supply matching within a community, and, (2) determine which of these options can suitably plug the existing demand–supply gap at varying levels of grid unavailability. A scenario analysis framework is developed to identify and assess the impact of different decentralized energy options at a community level and demonstrated for a typical urban residential community – Vijayanagar, Bangalore in India. A combination of LPG based CHP microgrid and proactive demand response by the community is the appropriate option that enables the Vijayanagar community to meet its energy needs 24/7 in a reliable, cost-effective manner. The paper concludes with an enumeration of the barriers and feasible strategies for the implementation of community microgrids in India based on stakeholder inputs.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are mass-produced and designed for different applications, ranging from monitoring of the environment to on-demand electrical switches, and so on. These IoT devices are often heterogeneous in nature, only to receive updates at infrequent intervals, and can remain ‘out of sight’ on a home or office network for extended periods. In other words, security and privacy are two key (research and operational) challenges in IoT systems. In recent years, there have been attempts to design deep learning-based solutions to mitigate limitations associated with detection systems designed for typical operational technology (OT) systems, although a number of challenges remain. This paper proposes a federated-based approach that employs a deep autoencoder to detect​ botnet attacks using on-device decentralized traffic data. Through the suggested federated solution, privacy is addressed by ensuring the device’s data is not transferred or moved off the network edge. Instead, the machine learning computation itself is brought to where the data is born (i.e. the edge layer), with the added benefit of data security. We demonstrate that using our proposed model, we can achieve up to 98% accuracy rate in the anomaly detection when using features such as source IP, MAC-IP, and destination IP, etc., for training. The overall comparative performance analysis between our decentralized proposed approach and a centralized format demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy rate of attack detection.},

 abstract = {Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the most widely accepted cryptography protocol to enable secure communication over the web. PKI comprises digital certificates managed by the certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the user’s identity, thus providing secure communication channels. However, the security of PKI is profoundly reliant on the reliability of these third-party CAs, which serves as a single point of failure for PKI. Over the past, there have been several incidents of popular CA breaches, where the centralized operation model of CAs caused numerous targeted attacks due to the spread of rogue certificates. In this paper, we aim to make the CA pool completely decentralized and concurrently build our decentralized solution cooperative with established PKI standards (i.e., X.509) for effective real-world integration. In particular, we harness blockchain technology to propose a decentralized PKI framework named ProofChain, which provides complete trust among a decentralized group of CAs. Our proposed solution provides all the traditional X.509 PKI operations (i.e., registration, validation, verification, and revocation), making it compatible with existing PKI standards. We have also evaluated ProofChain against popular security standards (i.e., the CIA triad model) and PKI adversarial attacks. Besides, to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed system, we have also evaluated the performance of the ProofChain by implementing it on the private testbed of the Ethereum network across various real-world PKI scenarios.},

 abstract = {This paper presents innovative approaches for guidance of spacecraft formations during reconfiguration, developed under the paradigms of cluster autonomy and safe maneuverability. A task-assignment algorithm identifies those satellites that need to be rearranged in order to minimize the total propellant consumption. The decision process relies on convex optimization procedures which estimate control laws and maneuvering trajectories, accounting for thruster technology constraints and collision avoidance. The path-planning has a twofold implementation. In the centralized approach, the reconfiguration strategy is elaborated by a single unit: the maneuvering trajectories are generated considering solely collision avoidance constraints at expenses of computational costs. The alternative method is conceived such that each satellite autonomously determines its tasks. This de-centralized architecture allows the algorithm to run faster, but entails a higher traffic on the intersatellite communication link. In addition, collision avoidance is approximated to make each optimization independent from the other. For preliminary validation of the developed routines, a specific mission scenario is considered, with a distributed Synthetic Aperture Radar in a low Earth orbit that has to be reconfigured for tomographic applications. Simulation results show that, once remote-sensing requirements are specified within the limits set by standard products, the developed algorithms can manage autonomously the maneuver towards the corresponding operative pattern. In details, the centralized approach allows the reconfiguration to be handled with mean delta-v savings around 30%. On the contrary, strategies are elaborated by the decentralized planners about 7 times faster.},

Then, a new construction-specific framework, Decentralized Construction Enabling Transparent Resolution (DCENTR), is proposed to address the unique nature of construction projects. Ultimately, it is shown that dispute likelihood can be minimized through reliable contract and payment execution, and if occurred, construction disputes can be resolved with higher transparency and dramatic savings in effort, time, and cost.},

 abstract = {Decentralization is a central characteristic of biological motor control that allows for fast responses relying on local sensory information. In contrast, the current trend of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches to motor control follows a centralized paradigm using a single, holistic controller that has to untangle the whole input information space. This motivates to ask whether decentralization as seen in biological control architectures might also be beneficial for embodied sensori-motor control systems when using DRL. To answer this question, we provide an analysis and comparison of eight control architectures for adaptive locomotion that were derived for a four-legged agent, but with their degree of decentralization varying systematically between the extremes of fully centralized and fully decentralized. Our comparison shows that learning speed is significantly enhanced in distributed architectures—while still reaching the same high performance level of centralized architectures—due to smaller search spaces and local costs providing more focused information for learning. Second, we find an increased robustness of the learning process in the decentralized cases—it is less demanding to hyperparameter selection and less prone to becoming trapped in poor local minima. Finally, when examining generalization to uneven terrains—not used during training—we find best performance for an intermediate architecture that is decentralized, but integrates only local information from both neighboring legs. Together, these findings demonstrate beneficial effects of distributing control into decentralized units and relying on local information. This appears as a promising approach towards more robust DRL and better generalization towards adaptive behavior.},

 abstract = {Centralization has become a de facto standard for implementing networked environments such as the Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS). Though easy to implement and control, centralized systems are difficult and expensive to scale in terms of the number of devices and the flow of information. This set of circumstances calls for a decentralized and distributed architecture for realizing such networked systems. However, due to the absence of global information in decentralized systems, one of the primary challenges is to find the best solution for problems distributed across the devices which are part of the CPS. Since the problems are distributed and no participating device has access to the full information, the devices may need to interact and share the information to select the best solution for a problem occurred. In this paper, we present a decentralized and distributed mechanism, which adapts to a stream of varying problems and continuously evolves and learns the best mappings between the problems and their associated solutions. The proposed approach integrates the concepts propounded in the three major Immune theories and can cater to real-world situations. The evolved mappings are shared across the physical network, thereby accelerating the search for the best set of solutions.

 abstract = {Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial industry in recent years. Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.},

 abstract = {In recent years, on the one hand, we have witnessed the rise of blockchain technology, which has led to better transparency, traceability, and therefore, trustworthy exchange of digital assets among different actors. On the other hand, achieving trustworthy content exchange has been one of the primary objectives of the Semantic Web, part of the World Wide Web Consortium. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies are the fundamental building blocks of Web3 (the third version of the Internet), which aims to link data through a decentralized approach. Blockchain provides a decentralized and secure framework for users to safeguard their data and take control over their data and Web3 experiences. However, developing trustworthy decentralized applications (Dapps) is a challenge because many blockchain-based functionalities must be developed from scratch, and combined with data semantics to open new innovative opportunities. In this survey paper, we explore the cross-cutting domain of the Semantic Web and blockchain and identify the critical building blocks required to achieve trust in the Next-Generation Internet. The application domains that could benefit from these technologies are also investigated. We developed a deep analysis of the published literature between 2015 and 2023. We performed our analysis in different digital libraries (e.g., Elsevier, IEEE, ACM), and as a result of our research, we retrieved 137 papers, of which 97 were retrieved as relevant to include in the paper. Furthermore, we studied several aspects (e.g., network type, transactions per second) of existing blockchain platforms. Semantic Web and blockchain technologies can be used to realize a verification and certification process for data quality. Examples of mechanisms to achieve this are the Decentralized Identities of the Semantic Web or the various blockchain consensus protocols that help achieve decentralization and realize democratic principles. Therefore, Semantic Web and blockchain technologies should be combined to achieve trust in the highly decentralized, semantically complex, and dynamic environments needed to build smart applications of the future.},

However, establishing such a network-wide calibration is typically a time-consuming task and requires user interaction. In this paper we present a decentralized and resource-aware algorithm for estimating the poses of all network nodes without any user interaction. This self-calibration of the network is achieved in two steps: First, overlapping camera pairs estimate relative positions and orientations by exchanging locally measured distances and angles to detected objects. Second, calibration information of overlapping cameras is spread throughout the network such that poses of non-overlapping cameras can also be estimated. Our approach does not rely on a priori topological information and delivers the extrinsic camera parameters with respect to a common coordinate system. In a simulation study we analyze the performance of our approach concerning the achieved spatial accuracy and computational effort considering noisy measurements and different communication schemes.},

However, SSI is a new identity management paradigm, and in the face of frequent interactions between identity credentials and application services, the existing research schemes have a coarse granularity of identity privacy protection, so there is an urgent need for attestation methods that selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attributes. In this study, we propose a SSI attribute selectively disclosable scheme based on a decentralized identifiers-hash verifiable credentials (DID-HVC) and design a model, that enables medical users not only to selectively minimize the disclosure of identity attribute data using verifiable credentials (VCs) with hash claims and combines with DID incorporating random obfuscation factors, to prevent overexposure of personal and healthcare privacy information, but also to safeguard users’ VCs are not linked and analysed. Finally, we provide a security and practicality analysis of our scheme and do simulation experiments based on Ethernet. The experimental results show that our scheme can more securely solve the problem of excessive privacy leakage of medical users within a feasible timeframe.},

But how might project management supported by blockchain technology look like? And how would such a new form change and affect traditional project management? Not many concepts have been designed or even implemented yet. We chose an experimental framework to answer the first aspects of these questions. We developed a Decentralized Autonomous Project Organization (DAPO) and conducted an experiment to study the impact of blockchain on traditional project management. We show that such a blockchain-based approach can support the management of simple projects. Further, a fair and clear incentive scheme seems crucial and influences the way team members engage in the work. Also, more decentralized project management increases the importance of social aspects-related project management principles such as teamwork, self-organization, and cultural aspects, while principles related to budget, objectives, and schedule remain unchanged.},

A review of research literature on decentralized intelligence in freight transport serves as the foundation of the analysis. The analysis reveals a scarcity of scientific evidence to suggest a successful introduction of decentralized freight intelligence. Among numerous conceptual findings, the analysis reveals a dearth of research on the clear and present challenges of introducing and adopting decentralized freight concepts in contemporary multi organizational open freight systems. For practitioners this paper provides useful input on future ICT development in the transport field. In particular, due to the lack of guidance on adoption of decentralized freight, a focus on non-networked benefits of information technology is to be recommended. Given the large number of projects, papers and various initiatives related to decentralized freight intelligence, this paper, to the authors’ best knowledge, provides a novel technology adoption perspective on decentralized freight intelligence research.},

 abstract = {Identity management has been ripe for disruption over the past few years due to recurring incidents of data breaches that have led to personal information leaks and identity theft. The rise of blockchain technology has paved the way for the development of self-sovereign identity (SSI)—a new class of user-controlled resilient identity management systems that are enabled by distributed ledger technology. This paper examines how SSI management can be used in a public transportation sector that spans different operators in multiple countries. Specifically, the paper explores how a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system can draw on the SSI framework to provide high-level security and transparency for all involved parties in public transportation ecosystems. Accordingly, building on analyses of the existing public transportation ticketing solutions, we elicited requirements of a comparable system based on the SSI principles. Next, we developed a low-fidelity prototype to showcase how passengers can utilize standardized travel credentials that are valid across different transportation networks in Europe. The proposed system eliminates the need for multiple travel cards (i.e., one for each transportation provider) and empowers individuals to have better control over the use of their identities while they utilize interoperable ticketing systems across Europe. Overall, building on the public transportation case, we offer a proof-of-concept that shows how individuals can better manage their identity credentials via the SSI framework.},

Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.},

The paper aims to connect these three aspects of smart manufacturing and proposes that through the application of data-driven modeling, CPPS will aid in transforming manufacturing to become more intuitive and automated. In turn, automated manufacturing will pave the way for the decentralization of manufacturing. Layering blockchain technologies on top of CPPS will ensure the reliability and security of data sharing and integration across decentralized systems.

This brings benefits, especially with a growing number of agents where the control design dimension remains low. Therefore, the proposed control design is especially suitable for morphing wings with a large number of actuation points. The result is presented in the Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) form.

This paper focuses on solving the optimal power flow problem in a distribution network with a fully decentralized mode that has massive photovoltaics and electric vehicles. First, an optimal power flow model considering photovoltaics and electric vehicles as controllable agents was established to achieve low network loss, low curtailment of photovoltaic resources, and high satisfaction of electric vehicle owners. Second, a novel linearized power flow model was proposed to produce per-node granularity communication. Thus, each node only needed to exchange the voltage message with its neighboring nodes. Then a decentralized quadratically constrained quadratic programming model based on the alternating direction method of multipliers was built to solve the optimal power flow problem. Next, a closed-form iterative solution method for the decentralized optimization was developed to improve the calculation speed for each iteration. Finally, case studies for a real 35-bus distribution system and a real 110-bus distribution system in China were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

For these reasons, this paper proposes a decentralized method to aggregate explanations sent by remote agents to human users according to the user's wishes and needs. To this end, the paper relies on the holonic multi-agent system to hierarchically decompose the environment and enables the aggregation of the explanations.

 abstract = {Scientific publication and its Peer Review system strongly rely on a few major industry players controlling most journals (e.g. Elsevier), databases (e.g. Scopus) and metrics (e.g. JCR Impact Factor), while keeping most articles behind paywalls. Critics to such system include concerns about fairness, quality, performance, cost, unpaid labor, transparency, and accuracy of the evaluation process. The Open Access movement has tried to provide free access to the published research articles, but most of the aforementioned issues remain. In such context, decentralized technologies such as blockchain offer an opportunity to experiment with new models for scientific production and dissemination relying on a decentralized infrastructure, aiming to tackle multiple of the current system shortcomings. This paper makes a proposal for an interoperable decentralized system for an open peer review ecosystem, relying on emerging distributed technologies such as blockchain and IPFS. Such system, named “Decentralized Science” (DecSci), aims to enable a decentralized reviewer reputation system, which relies on an Open Access by-design infrastructure, together with transparent governance processes. Two prototypes have been implemented: a proof-of-concept prototype to validate DecSci’s technological feasibility, and a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) prototype co-designed with journal editors. In addition, three evaluations have been carried out: an exploratory survey to assess interest on the issues tackled; two sets of interviews to confirm both the main problems for editors and to validate the MVP prototype; and a cost analysis of the main operations, both execution cost and actual price. Additionally, the paper discusses the multiple interoperability challenges such proposal faces, including an architecture to tackle them. This work finishes with a review of some of the open challenges that this ambitious proposal may face.},

We consider the case where each controller in the decentralized setting has its own sampling and actuation frequency, which translates to asynchrony between sensors and actuators. Additionally, asynchrony may be induced by delays between the sampling instants and actuation update instants as relevant in a networked context. The decentralized, asynchronous LTI system is represented as the feedback interconnection of a continuous-time LTI system operator and an operator that captures the effects of asynchrony induced by sampling and delay. By characterizing the properties of the operators using small-gain type Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC), we provide criteria for exponential stability of the asynchronous, decentralized LTI state-space models. The approach provided in this paper considers two scenarios, namely the ‘large-delay’ case and the ‘small-delay’ case where the delays are larger and smaller than the sampling interval, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed results is corroborated by a numerical example.},

 abstract = {Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are relatively a newly emerging type of online entity related to governance or business models where all their members work together and participate in the decision-making processes affecting the DAO in a decentralized, collective, fair, and democratic manner. In a DAO, members interaction is mediated by software agents running on a blockchain that encode the governance of the specific entity in terms of rules that optimize their business and goals. In this context, most popular DAO software frameworks provide decision-making models aiming to facilitate digital governance and the collaboration among their members intertwining social and economic concerns. However, these models are complex, not interoperable among them and lack a common understanding and shared knowledge concerning DAOs, as well as the computational semantics needed to enable automated validation, simulation or execution. Thus, this paper presents an ontology (Web3-DAO), which can support machine-readable digital governance of DAOs adding semantics to their decision-making models. The proposed ontology captures the domain logic that allows the sharing of updated information and decisions for all the members that interact with a DAO by the interoperability of their own assessment and decision tools. Furthermore, the ontology detects semantic ambiguities, uncertainties and contradictions. The Web3-DAO ontology is available in open access at https://github.com/Grasia/semantic-web3-dao.},

However, the governance of an OSS producing DAO should match the particularities of OSS production while also overcoming the existing challenges of decentralized governance. The existing decentralized governance frameworks do not include all the governance activities of OSS projects. Therefore, this study presents a governance framework for DAOs that produce OSS. The framework is built upon a total of 34 articles on DAO and OSS governance. The framework was evaluated in three leading DAOs that produce OSS. The evaluation underscores the significance of the framework and proves the potential of the systematic categorization of governance mechanisms.

 abstract = {Chain of custody is needed to document the sequence of custody of sensitive big data such as various healthcare data. In this work, we propose a secure and autonomous big data sharing system (BBS) based on a permissioned blockchain. In our system, we refer to the data stored at a blockchain node but outside the ledger for sharing as “off-state”, such as the large amounts of data (called “big data”) that cannot be stored directly in a blockchain ledger in practice. To securely and autonomously share the off-state data, we further design an off-state sharing protocol. In the proposed protocol, a sender registers the big data with BBS for sharing. To acquire the big data, an authenticated and authorized receiver has to propose transactions and interact with BBS in five phases, including data transfer authorization, data transfer, two-time key request, and data decryption. The key advantage of BBS is its ability to defeat dishonest users and autonomously perform the aforementioned five phases. The corresponding transactions are recorded in the ledger, serving as chain of custody evidences that document the data trail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system, we have designed and implemented prototypes of BBS for sharing big files over two representative permissioned blockchains, i.e., Hyperledger Fabric and Enterprise Ethereum. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the feasibility and performance of our system.},

In order to preserve data privacy, data owners may choose to upload encrypted data rather than raw data to the classification services. However, these solutions adopted today for encrypted data classification not only fall short in system flexibility and scalability, but also face the single point of failure problem. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate a secure decision tree classification scheme that allows decentralized authorization and access control service (SDTC-DAAC). Firstly, we propose a new framework that decouples data encryption and data computation logic to achieve the separation of data storage and computation, which significantly improves upon the flexibility and effectiveness, thus achieving cross-system compatibility requirements. Secondly, we present an end-to-end encrypted access control mechanism which enables authorized users from different parties to participate in calculations together. Finally, we further devise a scheme which serves decentralized storage service of data access control policies and access authorization without trusted intermediaries. Extensive property and performance analysis shows that SDTC-DAAC is effectiveness, as well as satisfying the security requirements for data privacy in an outsourcing environment.},

 abstract = {A transition from a fossil fuel based energy system to a more sustainable energy system based more on renewables has been of increasing concern worldwide over the past decade. Such a transition has considerable spatial-physical and socioeconomic implications, suggesting area-based perspectives and related decentralized governance approaches as being crucial to complement, or partly replace, traditional centralized governance approaches. In response to implementation barriers to energy policies, China has also begun to experiment with more decentralized governance structures through the launch of national pilot programs. In the meantime, international studies have disputed the widely assumed benefits of decentralized approaches. Scholars have especially cautioned that decentralization needs to be informed about the degree to which local stakeholders are willing and able to cope with newly acquired responsibilities or tasks. This research investigates the willingness and ability of Chinese local authorities to perform tasks indicated in the pilot program ‘New Energy Demonstration City (NEDC)’. This research, involving four case study cities and over 20 expert interviews, noted only modest willingness and ability. Local performance is constrained by inadequate local technical and managerial ability and a possible weak profile of renewable energy compared to other local priorities, and a limited local scope of influence over energy transition-related challenges as well decreased local willingness and ability. This research concludes that decentralization under energy policies should take place within a context of central support and stimuli, highlighting the importance of national policies and regulations to enable and activate local authorities and stakeholders in pursuing energy transition policies.},

 abstract = {In a decentralized household energy system comprised of various devices such as home appliances, electric vehicles, and solar panels, end-users are able to dig deeper into the system’s details and further achieve energy sustainability if they are presented with data on the electric energy consumption and production at the granularity of the device. However, many databases in this field are siloed from other domains, including solely information pertaining to energy. This may result in the loss of information (e.g. weather) on each device’s energy use. Meanwhile, a large number of these datasets have been extensively used in computational modeling techniques such as machine learning models. While such computational approaches achieve great accuracy and performance by concentrating only on a local view of datasets, model reliability cannot be guaranteed since such models are very vulnerable to data input fluctuations when information omission is taken into account. This article tackles the data isolation issue in the field of smart energy systems by examining Semantic Web methods on top of a household energy system. We offer an ontology-based approach for managing decentralized data at the device-level resolution in a system. As a consequence, the scope of the data associated with each device may easily be expanded in an interoperable manner throughout the Web, and additional information, such as weather, can be obtained from the Web, provided that the data is organized according to W3C standards.},

However, few schemes consider both fairness and copyright protection in the current literature. In this paper, we propose a flexible and Ethereum-based scheme to facilitate copyright protection in data sharing blockchain, by using watermark-based policies. This allows us to achieve properties such as preventing the re-selling of data (e.g., partial data, combined data, and leaked data). We also design five algorithms to automatically guarantee data sharing fairness and proactively protect data copyright, by using smart contracts. In other words, several new security features are introduced to existing transaction schemes, while still achieving feasible performance. The response times for each key step of smart contract in the proposed scheme is between 0.41 s and 0.91 s.},

The optimal solution can be used as a reference for tracking control and it guarantees that a speed-dependent safety constraint is satisfied both at the MP and everywhere within a Control Zone (CZ) which precedes it. We analyze the case of no active constraints and prove that under certain conditions the safety and speed constraints remain inactive, thus significantly simplifying the determination of an explicit decentralized solution. When these conditions do not apply, a complete solution is still obtained which includes all possible constraints becoming active. Our analysis allows us to study the tradeoff between the two objective function components (travel time and energy within the CZ). Simulation examples are provided to compare the performance of the optimal controller to a baseline consisting of human-driven vehicles with results showing improvements in both metrics.},

 abstract = {Public auditing enables data owners to entrust a third-party auditor (TPA) to perform auditing tasks periodically. To resist malicious TPAs, a plethora of blockchain-based public auditing mechanisms have been proposed. However, existing schemes cannot effectively mitigate single point of failure and collusion between TPAs and miners. These schemes are burdened by significant wastage of storage resources due to the presence of redundant data. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized auditing scheme supporting ciphertext deduplication (BDACD). BDACD leverages a decentralized blockchain, which takes over the role traditionally played by a centralized TPA. A decentralized autonomous organization is incorporated to enhance resistance against collusion attacks. By integrating advanced ciphertext deduplication techniques, BDACD effectively mitigates storage overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a novel concept, T-Merkle hash tree, along with a corresponding search algorithm. This innovation significantly enhances blockchain storage utilization and enables efficient half-interval searches within a block. To ensure accountability and fairness, a smart contract is employed to establish an arbitration mechanism. This mechanism serves a dual purpose: penalizing any malevolent actions by cloud servers and providing adequate compensation to data owners whose data integrity has been compromised. Detailed security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate BDACD has desirable security and efficiency.},

 abstract = {It is concerned that system-level benefits of connected automated vehicle control might only prevail in a far-future centralized control environment, whereas the benefits could be much offset in a near-future decentralized control system. To address this concern, this paper proposes a decentralized control model for connected automated vehicle trajectory optimization at an isolated signalized intersection with a single-lane road where each connected automated vehicle aims to minimize its own travel time, fuel consumption and safety risks. To improve the computational tractability, the original complex decentralized control model is reformulated into a discrete model. A benchmark centralized control model is also formulated to compare with the decentralized control model. The DIRECT algorithm is adopted to solve the above models. Numerical results show that the decentralized control model has better computational efficiency (with an average solution time of 10 s) than the centralized control model (with an average solution time of 60 s) without significant loss of the system optimality (with an average of 3.91%). Finally, analysis on connected automated vehicle market penetration shows that the extra benefit of the centralized control model is not obvious either in under-saturated traffic (less than 1%) or at a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate in critically-saturated and over-saturated traffic (less than 3% when the market penetration rate is lower than 20%). The results suggest that, as apposed to the earlier concern, the near-future decentralized control scheme that requires less technology maturity and infrastructure investment can achieve benefits similar to the far-future centralized control scheme with much simpler operations in under-saturated traffic, or in critically-saturated traffic and over-saturated traffic with a low connected automated vehicle market penetration rate.},

 abstract = {Increasing the penetration of variable and uncertain renewables and electric vehicles in power systems may give rise to problems (such as network congestion and commitment mismatches) if not controlled strategically. This demands control solutions in the form of energy management strategies for active distribution networks which would control the connected distributed energy resources and storage units in real-time to address the mentioned challenges. Centralized strategies may fail to serve this purpose for large-scale distribution networks due to their inherent shortcomings like vulnerability to single point of failures and large computing times. Unlike centralized approaches, decentralized control strategies show more potential. This paper presents one such solution, based on an adaptive multi-agent system, to control a large-scale distribution network in real-time. Its performance is compared with the results obtained with the corresponding centralized optimization problem, modeled as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Both the centralized version and the decentralized multi-agent version of the problem under consideration are presented and a case study is designed for the comparison. The comparison shows that the designed multi-agent system produces a near-optimal solution in real-time while the centralized optimization strategy struggles in terms of computational complexities for larger distribution networks. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The recent paradigm shift in VANETs protocols has led to the adoption of name data networking (NDN) as an underlying communication protocol in VANETs that replaces traditional address-based communication philosophy, treats content as a first-class citizen, and assigns unique names to contents consequently enabling name-based routing and forwarding, caching, and security. Although NDN has significantly improved the underlying communication issues in VANETs, a plethora of challenges such as message broadcast storms, in-efficient packet suppression mechanisms, intermittent connectivity owing to frequent topological changes, and reverse path partioning (RPP) require further attention from the research community. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes decentralized receiver-based link stability-aware forwarding (DRLSF) protocol. The DRLSF is a beacon-less receiver-based multi-hop protocol, well-suited for pull-based applications where end users request desired data by sending packets. The comparative performance analysis validates the effectiveness of the DRLSF protocol in different VANET environments and application scenarios.},

 abstract = {Identity and access management frameworks address user access rights and data governance for organizations, vendors and users. In response to the problems associated with centralized authorities (e.g. single point of failure, limited scalability, lack of user control), new identity management models have emerged, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which relies on verifiable data registers to validate Decentralized Identifier (DIDs) and can be achieved in many different ways, e.g. through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), distributed databases or other decentralized systems. The main goal of SSI is to enable users to take control of managing their data shared with different services. In this paper, we examine a possible application of the SSI concept to aerial base station (ABS)- integrated networks. The paper presents the effective use of DID implementation to provide a secure and decentralized way to create, associate and verify credentials and identities of ABSs, ensuring secure communication between Ground Base stations (GBSs) and other nodes in the network in a multi-operator scenario. In the numerical results, the average values of various metrics (namely, the average credential presentation time, the average credential offer time, the average DIDcomm connection creation time, the average DIDcomm signing time, and the average DIDcomm revoke credential time) related to credential operations in a DID management system are given for three different number of requests (50 K, 75 K, and 100 K). We have also provided the values of the different status codes that occurred in 100 K operations in the same DID management system. Towards the end of the paper, a comparison is made between SSI-based and Non-fungible token (NFT)-based blockchain solutions, also discussing the challenges and future directions of SSI solutions in the context of ABS-integrated networks.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, with the emergence of Web 3.0 and the metaverse, we collectively witnessed the explosive development of the decentralised autonomous organisation and the blockchain business model. Particularly, the advancement of technologies has further given birth to a novel form of social platform as blockchain-enabled social media (i.e., SocialFi), which is growing both in size and number of users. Accordingly, the rapid development of these blockchain-enabled social media firms illustrates the requirement to better understand the reasons behind this increase and the innovative practices and strategies of firms in this emerging field. Using the case of Pixie – the world’s first fully functional decentralised photo and video sharing social network based on blockchain technology, this insight paper identifies a conceptual model of blockchain-enabled social media that is useful for illustrating the successful business strategy and operations of firms. Particularly, the identified model employs four pillars of innovation as fundamental technologies, governance and operations, incentive mechanism design, and organisational structure and performance. Based on this crypto economy social media model, the study further presents the main challenges, discusses the implications based on agency theory, as well as highlights several directions for future research associated with blockchain-enabled social media.},

We show that it is possible to achieve this goal in a decentralized manner with each CAV solving an optimal control problem, and derive explicit solutions that guarantee collision avoidance and safe distance constraints within a control zone. We investigate the associated tradeoffs between minimizing energy and vehicle travel time, as well as the passenger comfort metric and include extensive simulations to illustrate this framework.},

 abstract = {Complex deep-space missions containing several tasks are beyond the capacity of a single probe and require multi-probe cooperation. Such missions need onboard planning to avoid communication delays caused by the long distance between the probes and the Earth. However, the traditional centralized planning approaches will burden the manager probe with a high computing load and make the system liable to a single-point failure. A decentralized onboard planning system based on privacy-preserving multi-agent negotiation is proposed to address this problem. The Privacy-preserving Decentralized Multi-Agent Mission Planning Frame (PDMA-MPF) is designed, in which the concepts of private agent and public agent are proposed for the first time. Based on the planning frame, the Decentralized Multi-Agent Iterative Negotiation Task Allocation Method (DMAIN) is developed to allocate tasks and generate local plans for probes. The method uses a deferred-acceptance negotiation pattern, considering the mission profit and load balancing of probes. An information consistency mechanism is designed for the public data synchronization of planners. The local planning of probes is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem with profit optimization. A temporal constraint handling algorithm and a Resource Rate Timeline (RRTL) based resource constraint handling algorithm are proposed to satisfy constraints in a profit optimized way. The planning system verification shows that the proposed system can generate reasonable plans and guarantee public data consistency between planners. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed planning system gets higher mission profits and a more balanced workload of probes, as compared with the traditional Hierarchical Greedy Algorithm.},

 abstract = {This paper describes two kinds of decentralized economic dispatch framework for the coordinated operation of multi-microgrids in a distribution network. Considering the high uncertainties of renewable energy sources and load demands, robust optimization-based distributed framework exhibits a prospective application on networked multi-microgrids in the future. By integrating analytical target cascading and robust model which can be solved using a column-and-constraint generation method, the robust economic dispatch problem can be applied in different entities, respectively, distribution network operator and microgrid operator in a decentralized way. Second way, column-and-constraint generation algorithm can be naturally realized in a decentralized and coordinated manner, specifically, the sub-problems and master-problem can be separately executed in microgrid operators and distribution network operator. Decentralized framework can respect the independence and privacy of different operators, and be beneficial to solve technical and economic challenges brought by centralized optimization. Numerical results of a modified IEEE 33-bus test distribution system with three microgrids validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and compare the characteristics of two kinds of decentralized implementations, and it is found that the first methodology shows better information privacy and lower communication burden, while the second way can obtain quicker convergence speed. In addition, cost comparison between cooperative case and three kinds of uncooperative cases is analyzed to explain economic benefits of cooperative operation. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis of lateral uncertainty and longitudinal uncertainty are given to show that robustness is enhanced at the expense of adding costs.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates a decentralized supply chain that is composed of one manufacturer and multiple distributors. The manufacturer produces goods and wholesales them to multiple distributors and then the distributors sell products to various markets. The entire production period of the manufacturer is divided into several intervals. The decision-making problem of the entire decentralized supply chain is presented as a two-echelon coordination game network, in which each decision-maker can influence decision-making of other levels. A Stackelberg game framework is proposed to coordinate the decision-making process. And then two nonlinear bi-level programming (BLP) models are developed to find the optimal equilibrium decision scheme by switching the leader and follower roles between the manufacturer and the distributors. The models consider the manufacturer’s budget constraints in each interval and the market demands are affected by distributors’ selling price and advertising strategies. According to the hierarchy and complexity of bi-level programming problem (BLPP), a nested bi-level method based on hybrid state transition algorithm is proposed to address the BLP models, and mapping approximation strategy is utilized to improve computational efficiency. Finally, the numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.},

 abstract = {Information technologies, such as blockchain, have promoted the development of decentralized decision-making in complex systems and generated many decentralized autonomous organizations. We construct a set of decentralized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models based on the basic decentralized decision mode of “votingmajority”, and we consider the assumptions that DMUs have no prior information about other DMUs’ decisions, and that they do. Then, the process of decision-making for each decision making unit (DMU) can be viewed as a social behavior over multiple time periods. Using a numerical example, we demonstrate that the new DEA models can provide acceptable efficiency results with specific weights for each DMU and can describe the details of the consensus relationship among DMUs. Similar to the market mechanism in reality, the efficiency scores of DMUs within an alliance containing more than half of the participants are overestimated, at the expense of nonallied DMUs. The models in this paper provide a possible path for efficiency measurement based on decentralized decision-making principles in complex systems.},

 abstract = {With the widespread application of distributed power generation, traditional energy consumers are becoming active prosumers. Giving full play to the role of the electricity market in resource allocation, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading between multiple prosumers and consumers helps increase the revenue of electricity sales and reduce the cost of electricity consumption. The participation of flexible resources in P2P energy trading achieves local power complementarity, improves benefits, and reduces the operating pressure of lines. To ensure the benefits of prosumers and stimulate their enthusiasm, it is necessary to propose an effective trading strategy to fully allow flexible resources to participate in P2P energy trading. Therefore, this paper establishes a P2P energy market based on the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. Based on the model predictive control (MPC) theory, we propose a minimum cost rolling optimization model to optimize the bidding quantity of flexible resources. Moreover, the Automatic Learning (AL) pricing strategy with privacy and learning is proposed. The AL bidding price strategy enables interactive learning among prosumers. In addition, the influence of bidding price on bidding quantity during the trading process is also considered. Furthermore, this paper considers the impact of renewable energy source (RES) uncertainty on the bidding decisions of prosumers. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by the simulation results of cases. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the benefits for prosumers, enhance the local balance ability, achieve price learning, and increase the transaction rate.},
