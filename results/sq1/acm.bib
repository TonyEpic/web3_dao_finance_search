abstract = {Web3, based on blockchain technology, is the evolving next generation Internet of value. Massive active applications on Web3, e.g. DeFi and NFT, usually rely on blockchain transactions to achieve value transfer as well as complex and diverse custom logic and intentions. Various risky or illegal behaviors such as financial fraud, hacking, money laundering are currently rampant in the blockchain ecosystem, and it is thus important to understand the intent behind the pseudonymous transactions. To reveal the intent of transactions, much effort has been devoted to extracting some particular transaction semantics through specific expert experiences. However, the limitations of existing methods in terms of effectiveness and generalization make it difficult to extract diverse transaction semantics in the rapidly growing and evolving Web3 ecosystem. In this paper, we propose the Motif-based Transaction Semantics representation method (MoTS), which can capture the transaction semantic information in the real-time transaction data workflow. To the best of our knowledge, MoTS is the first general semantic extraction method in Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Experimental results show that MoTS can effectively distinguish different transaction semantics in real-time, and can be used for various downstream tasks, giving new insights to understand the Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Our codes are available at https://github.com/wuzhy1ng/MoTS.},

abstract = {Financial institutions own balanced portfolios with different types of assets, resulting in a low-risk investment. At the same time, assets cannot be broken down into smaller parts with comparable risk for resale owing to regulators’ restrictions caused by a lack of auditability. Blockchain overcomes this issue with smart contracts. By now, the way to tokenize financial assets into a commodity is known. In this paper, we provide technical details for tokenization. Namely, an artificial dataset from Forex data is constructed for demonstration purposes; two tokenization algorithms are implemented and applied to the dataset; ERC1155-based smart contract is implemented and applied to the algorithms’ output to perform sold-out and secondary market steps.

abstract = {The music industry faces numerous challenges regarding tracking and distributing royalties. This article explores how a decentralized and transparent system for managing music royalties can be created with a smart contract implementation on the Polygon network, utilizing Chainlink oracles. By enhancing the efficiency and transparency of royalty distribution, this groundbreaking smart contract has the potential to revolutionize the music industry and stand as a blueprint for diverse sectors grappling with analogous challenges in intellectual property rights and revenue allocation. At its core, this smart contract, functioning on the bedrock of blockchain, ensures meticulous oversight of financial transactions between consumers and content creators. It streamlines the process and facilitates the collection of user view statistics crucial for strategic fund allocation. With the potential impact of transaction fees on the user experience of blockchain payments, a new solution has been developed that includes a payment channel that reserves significant amounts of funds and enables off-chain payments through specialized messages. By combining these technological advancements, we are taking a transformative step towards a more seamless and fair future in the complex world of royalty management. The application is structured into conventional backend and frontend segments, with the code available on Github.},

abstract = {The social network Twitter possesses a key characteristic: it is centralized, allowing Twitter Corporation to control data substitution and set moderation rules. However, this issue can only be resolved through the complete decentralization of the platform. To achieve this, blockchain technology is crucial as it enables the operation of decentralized applications with smart contracts serving as the foundation for system-user interaction. In this paper, we propose the minimum viable implementation of a similar social network called Brain Logger, which stores all necessary data in the NEAR blockchain network. Introducing a small fee for modifying data on the network ensures a solution to the aforementioned problems. The implementation includes a smart contract for blockchain networks and a web application frontend. The smart contract was developed using the NEAR software development kit in Rust, while the frontend was created in JavaScript using the React framework and Redux for local data storage. The code can be accessed on Github.},

abstract = {The metaverse, as a rapidly evolving socio-technical phenomenon, exhibits significant potential across diverse domains by leveraging Web3 (a.k.a. Web 3.0) technologies such as blockchain, smart contracts, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective. We (i) systematically review the development of the metaverse over the past 30 years, highlighting the balanced contributions from its core components: Web3, immersive convergence, and crowd intelligence communities, (ii) define the metaverse that integrates the Web3 community as the Web3 metaverse and propose an analysis framework from the community, society, and human layers to describe the features, missions, and relationships for each community and their overlapping sections, (iii) survey the state-of-the-art of the Web3 metaverse from a human-centered perspective, namely, the identity, field, and behavior aspects, and (iv) provide supplementary technical reviews. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic, interdisciplinary survey on the Web3 metaverse. Specifically, we commence by discussing the potential for establishing decentralized identities (DID) utilizing mechanisms such as profile picture (PFP) NFTs, domain name NFTs, and soulbound tokens (SBTs). Subsequently, we examine land, utility, and equipment NFTs within the Web3 metaverse, highlighting interoperable and full on-chain solutions for existing centralization challenges. Lastly, we spotlight current research and practices about individual, intra-group, and inter-group behaviors within the Web3 metaverse, such as Creative Commons Zero license (CC0) NFTs, decentralized education, decentralized science (DeSci), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Furthermore, we share our insights into several promising directions, encompassing three key socio-technical facets of Web3 metaverse development.},

abstract = {Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) have the capability of being a disruptive Web3 technology. Their usage of cryptographically secure distributed ledgers shows promise of replacing existing technical and financial intermediaries. However, this promise has not been fully materialised yet: existing attempts typically rely on centralisation as the required decentralised components do not exist or are not mature enough. We present our Web3 Deployment Experiment around a robust decentralised economy to address these issues. Our economy is unique due to the removal of all centralised components and governance. It is resilient against legal and economic attacks as no individual or organisation can compromise its functioning. We dub this characteristic extreme decentralisation. Similar to BitTorrent and Bitcoin, our extreme decentralisation DAOs carefully avoid single points of failure and are effectively unstoppable. Within our experiment around a music economy, we bypass all intermediaries in finance, technology, and the music industry itself with a direct donation to musicians. We demonstrate the viability of collective decision-making within our decentralised economy and present a set of principles for Web3 DAOs. Our implementation shows that the DAO ecosystem is fully deployable on smartphones, allowing anyone to create a DAO without reliance on central authorities or components.},

abstract = {Web services that use a blockchain and crypto-assets (Web3 services) improve user privacy by anonymous logins using wallet addresses. However, since many users list their account identities (IDs) on social networking service (SNS) profile pages and reuse their account IDs for self-branding and curation purposes, which increases the risk of de-anonymization on Web3 services by linking these accounts. If such high-risk SNS accounts hold large amounts of crypto-assets, they are subject to account hijacking and spoofing attacks for financial gain. In this study, we proposed a method to discover highly relevant SNS accounts from a seed account on Web2 and Web3 SNSs and estimate their account ownership. We applied our method to 480 seed accounts of 9 different SNSs and discovered 1,233 new accounts. We found that SNSs with multiple URL input forms on their profile setting pages linked more accounts and revealed that 207 out of 253 (81.8\%) users reused their IDs across different SNSs. We identified 26 accounts linked to personal and crypto-asset information that are at risk of de-anonymization. Our user study using crowdsourcing services showed that as many as 232 (40.8\%) out of 568 respondents do not understand the traceability of blockchain transaction histories. We examined the security and privacy risks caused by account listing and ID reuse, and made recommendations for service providers and users based on our findings.},

abstract = {Upon its arrival, the Ethereum blockchain promised to introduce a new paradigm of Internet-based applications that would revolutionize multiple fields, from finance to IoT to the public sector. Until now, scientific efforts have been primarily focused on theoretical discussions about the implications of the technology and on technical proposals to improve and consolidate the underlying infrastructure, neglecting the experience of people using blockchain-based systems. However, for this technology to permeate the mainstream, blockchain technology should be easily accessible to the general public. This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps. Also, we saw how blockchain metaphors and transaction-mediated interactions challenge established mental models for modern applications, imposing heavy workloads on users. We conclude the paper by discussing design implications resulting from blockchain’s paradigm change.},

As the core part of the DeFi ecosystem, decentralized lending protocols allow users to become lenders or borrowers in a completely decentralized fashion, such that an individual has complete control over their funds at all times. Collecting, analyzing, and visualizing lending data are crucial as these lending protocols are growing steadily. This paper presents an analysis model for decentralized lending protocols. Our main contributions are as follows. (i) We analyze and compare the top lending protocols; (ii) We present a general model to collect and process a large amount of data from multiple lending protocols in an exact and efficient manner; (iii) We design and implement a lending visualization system with various charts divided into three categories, i.e., lending market overview, token analysis, and user analysis.},

abstract = {Web3 social media strives to eliminate the need for centralized management by building upon on technologies such public ledgers and smart contracts. This has generated significant hype, but creates many notable challenges, many of which remain unaddressed. One such challenge is content moderation. Specifically, the immutable nature of blockchain means that it becomes impossible to retrospectively delete posts. This means that illegal content posts cannot be moderated or removed. In an attempt to overcome this, Web3 platforms, such as memo.cash, allow users to filter out posts from their personal timelines. Taking memo.cash as a use case, the goal of this work is to study the efficacy of the approach, and identify associated challenges. A particularly unique feature of memo.cash is that users must pay money (satoshi) for each social action (e.g., posting and blocking other users). We conjecture that this may impact the nature of moderation, particularly among poorer users. To explore this, we gather data from memo.cash covering 24K&nbsp;users, 317K&nbsp;posts, and 2.57M user actions. We investigate how the need to pay may impact the moderation system and propose potential solutions to address the challenges that arise.},

abstract = {The development of the Internet has revolutionized the news industry. While bringing various advantages, it has also caused an overflow of fake and malicious news, which has damaged social and economic benefits. In recent years, new news detection schemes are constantly proposed. In the scheme based on artificial detection, blockchain has become an important infrastructure and tool. Because blockchain is open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and traceable, it has important use value in the scenario of artificial detection, which requires the consensus of multiple entities. However, most of the current blockchain-based solutions focus on ex-ante detection, and they do not implement fine-grained detection division. Obviously, one validator cannot detect the authenticity of all types of news, which leads to a reduction in the credibility of the detection results. In this paper, we propose a framework for news full lifecycle management. First, the news is matched with the professional validators through a fine-grained detection control strategy. Then, based on sealed bid auction and secret sharing technology, a Six-stage Submission Protocol is proposed, which places the validator's consensus process off-chain, saving transaction costs and ensuring the credibility of the detection results. We analyzed the cost and performance of the proposed framework, and the results proved its correctness and feasibility.},

abstract = {Blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApp) have been widely adopted in different areas and trusted by more and more users due to the fact that the back end code of a DApp is publicly run on the blockchain and cannot be modified implicitly. However, there are few effective methods and tools for testing DApps and bugs can be easily introduced by inexperienced developers. The existing testing techniques either focus on testing front-end programs or back-end code but ignore the interaction between them, which makes it difficult to apply the techniques directly on DApp. In this paper, we present an automated testing technique for DApps which works in a two-phase manner. First, we employ random events to infer an abstract relation between browser-side events and blockchain-side contracts. Second, our technique generates a set of test cases under the guidance of inferred relations and orders the test cases based on a read-write graph. We also use taint analysis to track data flow of the smart contract and feed it to the generation procedure for following test cases. We have developed a tool called Sungari to implement our approach, and evaluated it on representative real-world DApps. The preliminary evaluation results demonstrated the potential of Sungari in achieving a significant optimization compared to random testing approaches.},

abstract = {A blockchain-based decentralized application (DApp) refers to an application typically using web pages or mobile applications as the front-end and smart contracts as the back-end. The front-end of the DApp helps users generate transactions and send them to the user's blockchain wallet. After the user signs and confirms the transaction using the blockchain wallet, the transaction will invoke the smart contract of the DApp. However, users bear the following risks when using DApps because of the potential inconsistent behaviors in DApps. First, the DApp front-end may generate incorrect transactions inconsistent with users' intentions. Second, the smart contract may have misbehaviors when executing the transactions. Inconsistent behaviors of DApps not only lead to user confusion but also cause significant financial losses. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to identify inconsistent behaviors of DApps on EVM-compatible blockchains by contrasting the behaviors of DApps that derived from the front-end, blockchain wallet, and smart contracts, respectively. We implemented our approach into a prototype named DAppHunter. We have applied DAppHunter on 92 real-world DApps of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain and successfully identified 37 DApps with inconsistent behaviors. We confirmed that 35 of them are scam DApps and over 5 million blockchain addresses are at risk of becoming victims of these inconsistent DApps.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.},

abstract = {Blockchain is undoubtedly one of the most potentially attractive technologies for the organization of financial services. The significance of the Blockchain technology in a banking system can be determined by three main principles that is; Disintermediation, Transparency and Provenance. The DLT (distributed ledger technology) eliminates the need for trust enforcer in the banking management system. This is made possible by the tamper- proof data in the distributed data records and all the participants in the network have the same version of data record with them at all times and it is unalterable. Blockchain promotes a public database record of all the customer transactions and other data, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy system as the customers have a 24x7 real-time access to it. Blockchain keeps an immutable distributed data ledger of transactions and this result in maintaining a lifecycle of the assets and its ownership from its first transaction to the most recent one. It reduces the chances of occurrence of theft, insurance fraud and misselling of the high valued assets or intellectual properties. Blockchain can be implemented in the banking sector for various applications like maintenance of data confidentiality, cheque clearing system, real time money transfer system (digital currency), supply chain finance, insurance, trade finance, KYC (know your customer), cross-border payments/transactions system, monitoring of consortium accounts, auction system and digital asset management. Blockchain technology can hence enable a decentralized solution for the banking ecosystem. The proposed system enables one platform for both the lenders and the borrowers to initiate their money transaction for lending, borrowing and repayment of the loan money. The transactions made throughout, that is, from the start to the last repayment can be viewed easily on a blockchain network thus increasing the transparency and trust of the customers and it resolves any disputes that can arise in the loan system. Along with this, a KYC registry based on blockchain is also proposed which will help in maintaining the KYC details in one platform which can be accessed by various banks for identification and verification of the customer in an easy and faster manner. It will increase the customer satisfaction as there will be no need for the customer to perform a KYC check every time he/she creates a bank account in any bank as the bank can easily access their KYC details from this system.},

abstract = {The deployment and management of Blockchain applications require non-trivial efforts given the unique characteristics of their infrastructure (i.e., immutability) and the complexity of the software systems being executed. The operation of Blockchain applications is still based on ad-hoc solutions that are error-prone, difficult to maintain and evolve, and do not manage their interactions with other infrastructures (e.g., a Cloud backend).This paper proposes KATENA, a framework for the deployment and management of Blockchain applications. In particular, it focuses on applications that are compatible with Ethereum, a popular general-purpose Blockchain technology. KATENA provides i) a metamodel for defining Blockchain applications, ii) a set of processes to automate the deployment and management of defined models, and iii) an implementation of the approach based on TOSCA, a standard language for Infrastructure-as-Code, and xOpera, a TOSCA-compatible orchestrator. To evaluate the approach, we applied KATENA to model and deploy three real-world Blockchain applications, and showed that our solution reduces the amount of code required for their operations up to 82.7\%.},

abstract = {The advent of Web3 technologies promises unprecedented levels of user control and autonomy. However, this decentralization shifts the burden of security onto the users, making it crucial to understand their security behaviors and perceptions. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive framework that identifies four core components of user interaction within the Web3 ecosystem: blockchain infrastructures, Web3-based Decentralized Applications (DApps), online communities, and off-chain cryptocurrency platforms. We delve into the security concerns perceived by users in each of these components and analyze the mitigation strategies they employ, ranging from risk assessment and aversion to diversification and acceptance. We further discuss the landscape of both technical and human-induced security risks in the Web3 ecosystem, identify the unique security differences between Web2 and Web3, and highlight key challenges that render users vulnerable, to provide implications for security design in Web3.},

abstract = {Gratuity (tips) plays a valuable role in the service sector. Tips exist in many countries more and more in a digital format. But digital tips lack transparency: givers have no proof of delivery, and recipients have no proof of assessing all the transactions and the amount’s immutability. A tips service provider is a single point of failure and should be trusted to keep the system working. Blockchain allows running a system in a trustless environment and can be a clue to the reliable decentralized digital gratuity. In the paper, we analyze a technology and business potential of a blockchain-based tips service and propose a full-stack prototype.},
