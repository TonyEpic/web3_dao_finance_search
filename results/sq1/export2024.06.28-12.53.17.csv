With the rapid development of blockchain and Web3 technologies, the decentralized metaverse ecology has attracted a large influx of users and capital. Due to the lack of industry standards and regulatory rules, the Web3-empowered metaverse ecosystem has witnessed a variety of financial crimes, such as scams, code exploit, wash trading, money laundering, and illegal services and shops. To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse. The overview of this paper is expected to help readers better understand the potential security threats in this emerging ecology, and to provide insights and references for financial crime fighting.","2644-1268","","10.1109/OJCS.2023.3245801","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973325,62032025); Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011661); Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Project(grant numbers:202102020616); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10045768","Blockchain;cybercrime;financial crime;Metaverse;Web3","Metaverse;Economics;Internet;Smart contracts;Industries;Ecosystems;Ecology","","27","","72","CCBYNCND","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this research paper, we focus on analyzing the lending aspect of Maker from a traditional finance perspective. To achieve this, we create a unique dataset with loan portfolios from the MakerDAO project, making it the first dataset of its kind in the DeFi field. This publicly available dataset contains essential financial characteristics related to borrowing, including balance, loss given default, annual equivalent rate, and probability of default. Additionally, we develop a specialized mathematical model tailored specifically to this project. This model allows us to estimate the probability of default by considering the presence of crypto-collateral and utilizing Brownian motion passage levels.

To store a patient’s medical history (including diagnoses and treatments), medical history (including diagnostic pictures), and financial data (including demographics and insurance details), a computerised database known as an “Electronic Health Record” (EHR) is used. Because medical records are typically private and must be shielded from prying eyes, ensuring their secure transfer is a top priority for healthcare systems. Electronic health records (EHRs) are used in the proposed study to ensure the security of all sent medical data, including the Chest X-ray MedPix images. This article describes a blockchain-based solution that patients can use to keep all their data in one secure location. This system was built with the Ganache tool on the Ethereum network, making use of Solidity and web3.js as well as other languages, tools, and approaches. In this study, a systematic method is described wherein blockchain smart contracts are used to record patient information and execute tasks in a distributed environment. After a smart contract has been deployed, all transactional communication occurs within its encrypted confines, protecting both the parties and their personal information. As an added bonus, the validated and broadcasted changes intended by the transaction can be checked. To ensure that government agencies have quick access to protected records, there is a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) that stores the information in an encrypted, decentralised manner. Both patients and physicians can use the wallet to log in. In addition, the system will manage and protect all of the doctor and patient’s information. Things like the following are in scope for the proposed system: Users may now access the same information at the same time because to blockchain’s distributed ledger capabilities, which boosts productivity, establishes trust, and lowers barriers to entry. Setting individual permissions for users allows for safe data storage. In addition, the suggested method enables the safe transmission of patient medical records.","","979-8-3503-4023-5","10.1109/ICACRS58579.2023.10405017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10405017","Electronic health record;Blockchain;Healthcare systems","Smart contracts;Trademarks;Blockchains;History;Electronic medical records;Medical diagnostic imaging;X-ray imaging","","","","15","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After conducting a qualitative analysis of this platform, we collected and analyzed relevant on-chain data, and found that the platform’s economic model generates early substantial returns for key opinion leaders (KOLs) but also restricts community size and stable earning potential, with 99.4% of accounts having fewer than 100 followers. Numerous speculative users were attracted to the platform, but only 22.1% of speculative returns were positive, and the trading frequency rapidly declined, with the average token holding period exceeding four days. The reliance on new users, combined with an inevitable decline in platform activity, indicates a less optimistic outlook for the sustainability of this economic model. The platform demonstrates a prominent level of transitivity and tighter social connections compared to existing social platforms.

The tax is used for development of the country which in turn benefits the citizens and improves the lifestyle of the population. Yet, the number of taxpayers in India is about 82.7 million people which is only 6.25 percent of the over 132 crore population. There are various reasons which lead to Indians not paying their taxes, the major being lack of transparency of information about the way the tax is being spent by the government. An application that is completely transparent in information storage is required, which should allow each and every citizen to pay their tax to the government and be able to monitor the usage of their tax money by the government.This research work proposes a novel tax tracker application. This application works completely over the blockchain technology, which prioritises decentralised data as its key principle. This solution can solve the transparency problem by showing the use of the tax amount by the government to the users and will keep a track of the amount and its allocation for various government projects. It also helps the government have a clear vision on how their constituencies are using the allocated budget.","2768-5330","979-8-3503-9725-3","10.1109/ICICCS56967.2023.10142226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142226","Block Chain;Cryptocurrency;Web3.0;Income Tax","Government;Sociology;Smart contracts;Finance;Transforms;Regulation;Blockchains","","1","","15","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens. By applying this categorization schema to 40 DAO communities hosted on the Aragon platform, encompassing over 423 000 participants and managing treasuries worth   ${\$}$  960M, we shed light on the prevailing characteristics of these DAOs. Contrary to assertions made by blockchain enthusiasts, our analysis reveals that DAOs predominantly operate in financial and technological domains, primarily offering blockchain-based services. Additionally, our investigation into their governance structure exposes limitations in terms of democratic participation, as decision-making power typically correlates with the number of tokens owned by the voter, resembling plutocracies rather than true democracies. We believe these findings will facilitate researchers’ comprehension of this innovative form of governance and aid practitioners in designing future DAOs with greater effectiveness.
