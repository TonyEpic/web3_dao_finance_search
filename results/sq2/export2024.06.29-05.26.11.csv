ONTOCHAIN includes technologies to achieve decentralised knowledge graphs, smart oracles, smart contracts, and tokenomics principles that rely on high integrity and trustworthiness. Consequently, we study the possibility to realize flexible incentives and taxation policies that contribute to the seamless achievement of SDGs.","2769-5654","979-8-3503-2028-2","10.1109/CSCI58124.2022.00234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216631","blockchain;smart contract;semantic technologies;public administration","Scientific computing;Decentralized autonomous organization;Data integrity;Smart contracts;Ecosystems;Finance;Knowledge graphs","","","","11","IEEE","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crisis management has no standard decentralized solution within DAO yet. A central authority is a natural component due to compliance reasons in certain domains, for example, special-purpose financing, in which the DAO governance model could be reasonably applied. More generally, a centralized DAO representative could streamline implementing DAO decisions that involve interactions with legacy systems. The article presents a perspective of modern technologies for organizing a foundation for special-purpose financing and considers longevity as a model example of the purpose.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3161392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9739690","Blockchain;decentralized autonomous organization;financing;longevity;smart contract","Decentralized autonomous organization;Blockchains;Smart contracts;Proposals;Decision making;Computer bugs;Industries","","7","","93","CCBY","22 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, preexisting loopholes in FEC regulation allow for contributions to be made in situations that do not require donors to disclose their identity, a term coined as “dark money”. The increase of dark money in campaign financing and the ability of political spending to influence voter perspectives and decisions puts the credibility of the political finance system at stake. Additionally, with the introduction of blockchain, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and smart contracts to political financing these technologies collectively can serve as a new vehicle for bad actors to use. In this paper, the effects of blockchain and smart contracts on political finance are examined through four use cases to demonstrate how these technologies can extend anonymous, foreign interference in political campaign financing and further cripple public trust in it.","","978-1-7281-5092-5","10.1109/HST47167.2019.9032940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9032940","Federal Election Commission (FEC);dark money;blockchain;decentralized autonomous organization (DAO);smart contracts","Voting;Contracts;Correlation;Bitcoin","","1","","13","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the proposed framework, the participants can buy a fractional share of an energy storage asset, embodied as a blockchain token, with corresponding rights and privileges enforced by smart contracts. The token holders continually vote to govern the battery's operation (charge/float/discharge); these votes are autonomously aggregated by the smart contract, which is also empowered to directly dispatch the battery's mode of operation by issuing physical control signals. Furthermore, the smart contract itself maintains a financial payment channel with the electricity market, transacting stable coins back and forth as it buys and sells energy from the spot market, per the token holders' consensus wishes. This paper presents a case study simulation of this radical conception of asset ownership and control, whereby token holders vote based on the real-time price of electricity, their particular electricity price forecast, and the current state of charge of the battery.","","978-1-6654-5198-7","10.1109/iGETblockchain56591.2022.10087085","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:20/EPSRC/3700); EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/S031901l1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10087085","Battery energy storage;Blockchain;Crowd-financing;decentralised governance;Distributed Autonomous Organisation","Decentralized autonomous organization;Simulation;Smart contracts;Decision making;Decentralized control;Predictive models;Electricity supply industry","","1","","20","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To prevent the negative effects of proposers' attention-capturing strategies that contribute to the “tragedy of the commons” and ensure an efficient distribution of attention among multiple proposals, it is necessary to establish a market-driven allocation scheme for DAOs' attention. First, the Harberger tax-based attention markets are designed to facilitate its allocation via continuous and automated trading, where the individualized Harberger tax rate (HTR) determined by the proposers' reputation is adopted. Then, the Stackelberg game model is formulated in these markets, casting attention to owners in the role of leaders and other competitive proposers as followers. Its equilibrium trading strategies are also discussed to unravel the intricate dynamics of attention pricing. Moreover, utilizing the single-round Stackelberg game as an illustrative example, the existence of Nash equilibrium trading strategies is demonstrated. Finally, the impact of individualized HTR on trading strategies is investigated, and results suggest that it has a negative correlation with leaders' self-accessed prices and ownership duration, but its effect on their revenues varies under different conditions. This study is expected to provide valuable insights into leveraging attention resources to improve DAOs' governance and decision-making process.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2024.124491","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62103411); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10539352","Attention;decentralized autonomous organizations;Harberger tax;Stackelberg game","Casting;Correlation;Decentralized autonomous organization;Decision making;Finance;Games;Pricing","","","","69","","27 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This user-friendly solution addresses the limitations of traditional financial systems by streamlining lending and borrowing operations, ultimately promoting broader adoption of DeFi beyond technology enthusiasts. The core protocol components encompass lending and borrowing managers and a liquidation manager to ensure the timely initiation of liquidations under unfavorable conditions. We also discuss various interest rate models to optimize the protocol's performance. To further advance the project's decentralization and governance, we advocate for establishing a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and exploring the potential integration of flash loans functionality. By offering an accessible, versatile, and robust DeFi platform through our pool-based liquidity protocol, we aim to accelerate the adoption of decentralized finance and extend its benefits to the broader population.","","979-8-3503-3923-9","10.1109/BCCA58897.2023.10338926","Slovak Research and Development Agency(grant numbers:APVV-20-0338); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10338926","DeFi;traditional finances;blockchain;smart contracts;Polkadot","Protocols;Decentralized autonomous organization;Scalability;Sociology;Smart contracts;Finance;Decentralized applications","","","","29","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
