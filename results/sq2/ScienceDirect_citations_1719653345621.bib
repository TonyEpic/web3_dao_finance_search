abstract = {The crypto-asset market has shown variations in efficiency across assets and time, but limited research has explored the driving factors beyond liquidity. Exploiting a dataset of 122 crypto-assets, with imbalanced data, this study investigates the impact of market conditions and inherent asset characteristics on return predictability. Our findings reveal that both factors significantly influence the efficiency of crypto-assets. Notably, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) exhibit higher efficiency compared to non-DAO projects. This suggests that transparent decentralized decision-making models can reduce information asymmetry, leading to a more efficient market pricing. Furthermore, we show a positive relationship between market efficiency and increased liquidity and age. These insights shed light on the role of DAOs as catalysts for enhancing market efficiency and have important implications for investors and market participants in the crypto-asset market.}

abstract = {Despite the past decade’s rapid innovation in adapting blockchain technology to new uses, financial intermediation remains elusive except in basic and highly collateralized forms. We introduce the concept of the technical frontier to delimit the kinds of interactions that can feasibly be structured algorithmically among pseudonymous agents, as on a blockchain, and show that lending and financial intermediation – unlike monetary exchange – lie outside it, even in simple forms. The path forward for truly blockchain-native financial applications, therefore, must involve the integration of real-world identity information in order to disincentivize defection. We discuss several potential technologies for doing so, and conclude that such integration is possible without compromising pseudonymity, provided real-world identity is available in the breach.}

abstract = {Decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) powered by blockchain technologies has the potential to transform the organisational governance model with the foundations of algorithmic trust and democratic systems. DAO envisages a decentralised democratic organisation using software-based smart contracts to execute autonomous transactions with consensus among stakeholders. The study investigates the prospects of adopting DAO led corporate governance to manage agency (theory) problems in the light of institutional (theory) pressures. The paper depicts how algorithmic trust led corporate governance measures help any organisation follow policies, rules and regulations using DAO led corporate governance (DAOCG) framework. The authors mapped the constituents of agency theory, ethical decision-making, and institutional factors to propose the DAOCG framework. The DAOCG framework is assessed using a thematic analysis of 16 expert interviews with relevant experience from corporate governance and audit domains from varied industries across geographies. The research leveraged MAXQDA software to analyse interview transcripts and opinion codes. The framework helps to identify the core elements of DAO-led corporate governance (DAOCG) and provides the potential to study the theoretically sequenced practical constituents of corporate governance. The first-of-its-kind practical DAOCG framework can be used in the pursuits of digital transformation, business model innovation and social change.}

abstract = {Without a doubt, blockchain, as one of the most valuable technological advancements, has been introduced over the past decade and has played a significant role in the industrial revolution. The emergence of other technologies derived from blockchain, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and the Metaverse, has fundamentally transformed people’s daily lives and profoundly impacted future versions of digital businesses. This study explored the evolution of digital businesses in the near future, with a specific focus on the two primary technologies mentioned above. First, we reviewed DeFi-based technologies, including GameFi, SciFi, SocialFi, and others which serve as foundational building blocks for future jobs and businesses. Second, we examined Metaverse-based jobs, such as Metaverse-based academies and markets which are expected to be launched as commonly used businesses. Ultimately, this study provides several guidelines, such as how to use DeFi 2.0 and apply centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi)-based platforms. Additionally, it offers future directions for launching these businesses, including controlling the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in practical applications, utilizing cloud-assisted models for the Metaverse, and providing conditional privacy for future Metaverse-based businesses.}

abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and its governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, network and Twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences the Maker protocol and that the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate over whether DeFi can be truly decentralized.}

abstract = {Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a new form of organization, the innovation of which consists in the use of blockchain technology to record the applicable rules governing the project as well as the rights and obligations of its members, usually investors. Moreover, the method of financing the project is also new here, since tokens (cryptocurrency), which are acquired by investors for the capital contributed, are most frequently used. Management in DAO is previously unheard of (until the creation of DAO-2016), since there are no governing bodies, and all decisions are made by the voting of all members of the organization. In the article, an attempt is made to assess the DAO management process, having previously analyzed blockchain technology and the specificity of this new form of organization. The own research was conducted on a selected DAO project, when analyzing the management process implemented by voting by the members of this organization from its launch (May 2022) to 11 May 2023. The obtained results confirmed the dominance of majority shareholders in DAO votes, although the method of voting (Qudratic voting) used in the project under study to protect the rights of small shareholders significantly reduced this impact. The unusual unanimity of decision-makers was also noted (as much as 65% of unanimous votes), which, as it turned out, could be the result of information campaigns conducted before each vote by groups of small investors deeply involved in the project. These activities should also translate into the accuracy of the decisions made, and thus the quality of the DAO management process.}

We find that asset pricing in these rapidly evolving markets is better explained through BeFi than through traditional finance (TradFi) theory. Investor attention, sentiment, heuristics and biases, and network effects interact to form a highly volatile and dynamic market. We offer a deterministic research framework with propositions for future research. We further provide investors with a theoretically and empirically supported structure to better inform their decisions through an understanding of BeFi applications to DeFi.}
