abstract = {In recent years, when the world economic activity was affected by the epidemic, it was very active in the virtual world. Since Facebook announced the development of the Metaverse, its related applications and services have instantly become hot issues. Although it may take a few years for the Metaverse to become popular as a social platform today, its impact on future community development will be significant. On the other hand, since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs, and the issue of decentralization has gradually spread. Today, as the application of smart contracts becomes more and more extensive and innovative, such as the decentralized architecture and applications of NFT, DeFi, GameFi, DApp, DAO, DEX, its influence has gradually expanded from the virtual world to physical applications, and also has impacts on real financial applications. The recent burst of NFT and DeFi addressed this issue. There are some gaps between reality and hype, and it is a lesson just like e-commerce burst some 20 years ago. A well format regulation and supervision seem required. However, the challenge for financial supervision today is the decentralized application and anonymity. This paper discusses the innovations in communities that related to decentralized financial services in the blockchain. And the blockchain financial supervision issues that within the tolerable range of risk and impact to both virtual and real world.},

abstract = {In this paper we present MOATcoin, a gamelike experiment that enabled us to practically investigate the open issues related to the governance and legal facets of smart contract based decentralized applications. After presenting the MOATcoin system architecture, we first tackle the problems of decentralized governance, its limits and the shift of trust that it entails; then, we explore the possible legal implications of the given scenario and, particularly, the consequences of code-written contracts. Finally, we offer taxonomical remarks on the concepts of "token" and "coin" and offer an insight from a regulatory perspective.},

abstract = {Economic systems play pivotal roles in the metaverse. However, we have not yet found an overview that systematically introduces economic systems for the metaverse. Therefore, we review the state-of-the-art solutions, architectures, and systems related to economic systems. When investigating those state-of-the-art studies, we keep two questions in mind: (1) What is the framework of economic systems in the context of the metaverse? and (2) What activities would economic systems engage in the metaverse? This article aims to disclose insights into the economic systems that work for both the current and the future metaverse. To have a clear overview of the economic system framework, we mainly discuss the connections among three fundamental elements in the metaverse, i.e., digital creation, digital assets, and the digital trading market. After that, we elaborate on each topic of the proposed economic system framework. Those topics include incentive mechanisms, monetary systems, digital wallets, decentralized finance activities, and cross-platform interoperability for the metaverse. For each topic, we mainly discuss three questions: (a) the rationale of this topic, (b) why the metaverse needs this topic, and (c) how this topic will evolve in the metaverse. Through this overview, we wish readers can better understand what economic systems the metaverse needs and the insights behind the economic activities in the metaverse.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology offers a sizable promise to rethink the way interorganizational business processes are managed because of its potential to realize execution without a central party serving as a single point of trust (and failure). To stimulate research on this promise and the limits thereof, in this article, we outline the challenges and opportunities of blockchain for business process management (BPM). We first reflect how blockchains could be used in the context of the established BPM lifecycle and second how they might become relevant beyond. We conclude our discourse with a summary of seven research directions for investigating the application of blockchain technology in the context of BPM.},

abstract = {Motivated by the need to automatically generate behavior-based security challenges to improve user authentication for web services, we consider the problem of large-scale construction of realistic-looking names to serve as aliases for real individuals. We aim to use these names to construct security challenges, where users are asked to identify their real contacts among a presented pool of names. We seek these look-alike names to preserve name characteristics like gender, ethnicity, and popularity, while being unlinkable back to the source individual, thereby making the real contacts not easily guessable by attackers.To achive this, we introduce the technique of distributed name embeddings, representing names in a high-dimensional space such that distance between name components reflects the degree of cultural similarity between these strings. We present different approaches to construct name embeddings from contact lists observed at a large web-mail provider, and evaluate their cultural coherence. We demonstrate that name embeddings strongly encode gender and ethnicity, as well as name popularity. We applied this algorithm to generate imitation names in email contact list challenge. Our controlled user study verified that the proposed technique reduced the attacker's success rate to 26.08\%, indistinguishable from random guessing, compared to a success rate of 62.16\% from previous name generation algorithms.Finally, we use these embeddings to produce an open synthetic name resource of 1 million names for security applications, constructed to respect both cultural coherence and U.S. census name frequencies.},
